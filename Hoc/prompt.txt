***TASK***
The task is to decide relevant COVID-19 topics of the article based on its abstract.
***INPUT***
The input is an abstract text.
***DOCUMENTATION***
There are 7 topics you will need to decide whether the article is related to. The followings are the topics and their definitions.
Mechanism: underlying cause(s) of COVID-19 infections and transmission and possible drug mechanism of action. 
Transmission: characteristics and modes of COVID-19 transmissions. 
Diagnosis: COVID-19 assessment through symptoms, test results and radiological features for COVID-19. 
Treatment: treatment strategies, therapeutic procedures and vaccine development for COVID-19. 
Prevention: prevention, control, mitigation and management strategies for COVID-19. 
Case Report: descriptions of specific patient cases related to COVID-19. 
Epidemic Forecasting: estimation on the trend of COVID-19 spread and related modeling approach. 
***OUTPUT***
The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each topic: Treatment, Diagnosis, Prevention, Mechanism, Transmission, Epidemic Forecasting, Case Report.
Put value 1 if the article is related to that topic, 0 if the article is not related to that topic. 
Please note one article can be related to multiple topics.
Example output format:
{
  "Treatment": ,
  "Diagnosis": ,
  "Prevention": ,
  "Mechanism": ,
  "Transmission": ,
  "Epidemic Forecasting": ,
  "Case Report": 
}
***EXAMPLES***
INPUT: COVID-19 and implications for dermatological and allergological diseases. COVID-19, 
caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has become pandemic. A further level of complexity opens up as 
soon as we look at diseases whose pathogenesis and therapy involve different immunological signaling 
pathways, which are potentially affected by COVID-19. Medical treatments must often be reassessed 
and questioned in connection with this infection. This article summarizes the current knowledge of 
COVID-19 in the light of major dermatological and allergological diseases. It identifies medical areas 
lacking sufficient data and draws conclusions for the management of our patients during the pandemic. 
We focus on common chronic inflammatory skin diseases with complex immunological pathogenesis: 
psoriasis, eczema including atopic dermatitis, type I allergies, autoimmune blistering and 
inflammatory connective tissue diseases, vasculitis, and skin cancers. Since several other 
inflammatory skin diseases display related or comparable immunological reactions, clustering of 
the various inflammatory dermatoses into different disease patterns may help with therapeutic decisions. 
Thus, following these patterns of skin inflammation, our review may supply treatment recommendations and 
thoughtful considerations for disease management even beyond the most frequent diseases discussed here.

  "Diagnosis": 0,
  "Prevention": 0,
  "Mechanism": 0,
  "Transmission": 0,
