34336157	Disentangling the Association of Hydroxychloroquine Treatment with Mortality in Covid-19 Hospitalized Patients through Hierarchical Clustering. The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection is harshly debated, with observational and experimental studies reporting contrasting results. To clarify the role of HCQ in Covid-19 patients, we carried out a retrospective observational study of 4,396 unselected patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in Italy (February-May 2020). Patients' characteristics were collected at entry, including age, sex, obesity, smoking status, blood parameters, history of diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and chronic pulmonary diseases, and medications in use. These were used to identify subtypes of patients with similar characteristics through hierarchical clustering based on Gower distance. Using multivariable Cox regressions, these clusters were then tested for association with mortality and modification of effect by treatment with HCQ. We identified two clusters, one of 3,913 younger patients with lower circulating inflammation levels and better renal function, and one of 483 generally older and more comorbid subjects, more prevalently men and smokers. The latter group was at increased death risk adjusted by HCQ (HR[CI95%] = 3.80[3.08-4.67]), while HCQ showed an independent inverse association (0.51[0.43-0.61]), as well as a significant influence of cluster *HCQ interaction (p < 0.001). This was driven by a differential association of HCQ with mortality between the high (0.89[0.65-1.22]) and the low risk cluster (0.46[0.39-0.54]). These effects survived adjustments for additional medications in use and were concordant with associations with disease severity and outcome. These findings suggest a particularly beneficial effect of HCQ within low risk Covid-19 patients and may contribute to clarifying the current controversy on HCQ efficacy in Covid-19 treatment.

34211701	Risk factors for mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from three hospitals in Peru: a retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Peru was one of the countries with the highest COVID-19 mortality worldwide during the first stage of the pandemic. It is then relevant to evaluate the risk factors for mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in three hospitals in Peru in 2020, from March to May, 2020. Methods: We carried out a retrospective cohort study. The population consisted of patients from three Peruvian hospitals hospitalized for a diagnosis of COVID-19 during the March-May 2020 period. Independent sociodemographic variables, medical history, symptoms, vital functions, laboratory parameters and medical treatment were evaluated. In-hospital mortality was assessed as the outcome. We performed Cox regression models (crude and adjusted) to evaluate risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Hazard ratios (HR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Results: We analyzed 493 hospitalized adults; 72.8% (n=359) were male and the mean age was 63.3 +/- 14.4 years. COVID-19 symptoms appeared on average 7.9 +/- 4.0 days before admission to the hospital, and the mean oxygen saturation on admission was 82.6 +/- 13.8. While 67.6% (n=333) required intensive care unit admission, only 3.3% (n=16) were admitted to this unit, and 60.2% (n=297) of the sample died. In the adjusted regression analysis, it was found that being 60 years old or older (HR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.14-2.15), having two or more comorbidities (HR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.10-2.14), oxygen saturation between 85-80% (HR=2.52; 95% CI: 1.58-4.02), less than 80% (HR=4.59; 95% CI: 3.01-7.00), and being in the middle (HR=1.65; 95% CI: 1.15-2.39) and higher tertile (HR=2.18; 95% CI: 1.51-3.15) of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, increased the risk of mortality. Conclusions: The risk factors found agree with what has been described in the literature and allow the identification of vulnerable groups in whom monitoring and early identification of symptoms should be prioritized in order to reduce mortality.

34367415	Inflammation in COVID-19: from pathogenesis to treatment. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). To date, there were > 163 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the disease has claimed > 3.3 million lives globally. As with many other diseases, inflammation is a key feature of COVID-19. When inflammation is overwhelming, it may lead to unfavorable outcomes or even death. Scientists all over the world are working tirelessly in search of therapeutic strategies to suppress or modulate inflammation in COVID-19. This review gives an overview of the role of inflammation in COVID-19. It also critically examines the various treatment approaches that target the immune system and inflammation in COVID-19, as well as highlights the key findings in the numerous studies conducted thus far.

34218393	Antimalarial drugs-are they beneficial in rheumatic and viral diseases?-considerations in COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of the medical fraternity is continuously involved in finding new therapeutic schemes, including antimalarial medications (AMDs), which can be useful in combating the 2019-nCoV: coronavirus disease (COVID-19). For many decades, AMDs have been widely used in the treatment of malaria and various other anti-inflammatory diseases, particularly to treat autoimmune disorders of the connective tissue. The review comprises in vitro and in vivo studies, original studies, clinical trials, and consensus reports for the analysis, which were available in medical databases (e.g., PubMed). This manuscript summarizes the current knowledge about chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and shows the difference between their use, activity, recommendation, doses, and adverse effects on two groups of patients: those with rheumatic and viral diseases (including COVID-19). In the case of connective tissue disorders, AMDs are prescribed for a prolonged duration in small doses, and their effect is observed after few weeks, whereas in the case of viral infections, they are prescribed in larger doses for a short duration to achieve a quick saturation effect. In rheumatic diseases, AMDs are well tolerated, and their side effects are rare. However, in some viral diseases, the effect of AMDs is questionable or not so noticeable as suggested during the initial prognosis. They are mainly used as an additive therapy to antiviral drugs, but recent studies have shown that AMDs can diminish the efficacy of some antiviral drugs and may cause respiratory, kidney, liver, and cardiac complications.

34131026	"Integration of virtual physician visits into a provincial 8-1-1 health information telephone service during the COVID-19 pandemic: a descriptive study of HealthLink BC Emergency iDoctor-in-assistance (HEiDi). BACKGROUND: British Columbia, like many jurisdictions, has a health information telephone service (8-1-1) to provide callers with information by registered nurses and help them decide whether to attend an emergency department or primary care clinic, or manage their concern at home. We describe a new service, HealthLink BC Emergency iDoctor-in-assistance (HEiDi), that partnered physicians available by videoconferencing with 8-1-1 registered nurses to support callers. METHODS: From Apr. 6 to Aug. 2, 2020, all callers to the 8-1-1 telephone service (available to anyone in BC) categorized as ""seek care within 24 hours"" by registered nurses were eligible for referral to HEiDi. HEiDi physicians (""virtual physicians"") connected directly with callers via desktop videoconferencing software, assessed their health complaint, provided advice and suggested care disposition. We conducted a descriptive study and collected demographic characteristics, health concern and disposition determined by the virtual physician. RESULTS: HEiDi virtual physicians provided 7687 consultations. Most patients (n = 4439, 57.8%) were in the 20-64 age range, and 4814 (62.9%) were female. Common health concerns were related to gastroenterology (n = 1275, 16.6%), respiratory (n = 877, 11.4%) and dermatology (n = 874, 11.4%). From the 7531 calls with available data, 2548 (33.8%) callers were advised to attempt home treatment, 2885 (38.3%) to contact a primary care physician within 1 week, 1131 (15.0%) to attend an emergency department immediately and 538 (7.1%) to attend their primary provider now. INTERPRETATION: We found that virtual physicians were able to advise nearly 3 out of 4 (72.1%) patients away from in-person emergency or clinic assessment and 1 in 7 (15.0%) to seek immediate emergency department care. Virtual physicians can provide an effective complement to a provincial health telephone system."	Prevention
34206990	Human Defensins Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Blocking Viral Entry. Innate immunity during acute infection plays a critical role in the disease severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and is likely to contribute to COVID-19 disease outcomes. Defensins are highly abundant innate immune factors in neutrophils and epithelial cells, including intestinal Paneth cells, and exhibit antimicrobial and immune-modulatory activities. In this study, we investigated the effects of human alpha- and beta-defensins and RC101, a theta-defensin analog, on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that human neutrophil peptides (HNPs) 1-3, human defensin (HD) 5 and RC101 exhibited potent antiviral activity against pseudotyped viruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. HNP4 and HD6 had weak anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, whereas human beta-defensins (HBD2, HBD5 and HBD6) had no effect. HNP1, HD5 and RC101 also inhibited infection by replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Pretreatment of cells with HNP1, HD5 or RC101 provided some protection against viral infection. These defensins did not have an effect when provided post-infection, indicating their effect was directed towards viral entry. Indeed, HNP1 inhibited viral fusion but not the binding of the spike receptor-binding domain to hACE2. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of defensins was influenced by the structure of the peptides, as linear unstructured forms of HNP1 and HD5 lost their antiviral function. Pro-HD5, the precursor of HD5, did not block infection by SARS-CoV-2. High virus titers overcame the effect of low levels of HNP1, indicating that defensins act on the virion. HNP1, HD5 and RC101 also blocked viral infection of intestinal and lung epithelial cells. The protective effects of defensins reported here suggest that they may be useful additives to the antivirus arsenal and should be thoroughly studied.	Mechanism;Treatment
34201687	Occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Six Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants at the Early Stage of COVID-19 Pandemic in The United States. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in primary influent (n = 42), secondary effluent (n = 24) and tertiary treated effluent (n = 34) collected from six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs A-F) in Virginia (WWTP A), Florida (WWTPs B, C, and D), and Georgia (WWTPs E and F) in the United States during April-July 2020. Of the 100 wastewater samples analyzed, eight (19%) untreated wastewater samples collected from the primary influents contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA as measured by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays. SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected in influent wastewater samples collected from WWTP A (Virginia), WWTPs E and F (Georgia) and WWTP D (Florida). Secondary and tertiary effluent samples were not positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA indicating the treatment processes in these WWTPs potentially removed SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the secondary and tertiary treatment processes. However, further studies are needed to understand the log removal values (LRVs) and transmission risks of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through analyzing wastewater samples from a wider range of WWTPs.

34221844	Predictive Score of Risk Associated with Progression of Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia in Wuhan, China: the ALA Score. Background The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) had become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern with more than 90 million confirmed cases worldwide. Therefore, this study aims to establish a predictive score model of progression to severe type in patients with COVID-19. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of 151 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by nucleic acid test or specific serum antibodies from February 13, 2020, to March 14, 2020, hospitalized in a COVID-19-designed hospital in Wuhan, China. Results Of the 151 patients with average age of 63 years, 64 patients were male (42.4%), and 29 patients (19.2%) were classified as severe group. Multivariate analysis showed that age > 65 years (odds ratio [OR] = 9.72, 95%CI: 2.92-32.31, P < 0.001), lymphocyte count </= 1.1 x 10(9)/L (OR = 3.42, 95%CI: 1.24-9.41, P = 0.017) and AST > 35 U/L (OR = 3.19, 95%CI: 1.11-9.19, P = 0.032) were independent risk factors for the disease severity. The area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curve of the probabilities of the composite continuous variable (age + lymphocyte + AST) is 0.796. Finally, a predictive score model called ALA was established, and its AUC was 0.83 (95%CI: 0.75-0.92). Using a cutoff value of 9.5 points, the positive and negative predictive values were 54.1% (38-70.1%) and 92.1% (87.2-97.1%), respectively. Conclusion The ALA score model can quickly identify severe patients with COVID-19, so as to help clinicians to better choose accurate management strategy.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34208136	NOX2 Activation in COVID-19: Possible Implications for Neurodegenerative Diseases. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading contagious infectious disease caused by the pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that primarily affects the respiratory tract as well as the central nervous system (CNS). SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through the interaction of the viral protein Spike with the angiotensin II receptor (ACE 2), leading to an increase of angiotensin II and activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase2 (NOX2), resulting in the release of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory molecules. The purpose of the review is to explain that SARS-CoV-2 infection can determine neuroinflammation that induces NOX2 activation in microglia. To better understand the role of NOX2 in inflammation, an overview of its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is provided. To write this manuscript, we performed a PubMed search to evaluate the possible relationship of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NOX2 activation in microglia, as well as the role of NOX2 in NDs. Several studies highlighted that NOX2 activation in microglia amplifies neuroinflammation. To date, there is no clinical treatment capable of counteracting its activation, however, NOX2 could be a promising pharmaceutical target useful for both the treatment and prevention of NDs and COVID-19 treatment.

33566839	Adaptive social contact rates induce complex dynamics during epidemics. Epidemics may pose a significant dilemma for governments and individuals. The personal or public health consequences of inaction may be catastrophic; but the economic consequences of drastic response may likewise be catastrophic. In the face of these trade-offs, governments and individuals must therefore strike a balance between the economic and personal health costs of reducing social contacts and the public health costs of neglecting to do so. As risk of infection increases, potentially infectious contact between people is deliberately reduced either individually or by decree. This must be balanced against the social and economic costs of having fewer people in contact, and therefore active in the labor force or enrolled in school. Although the importance of adaptive social contact on epidemic outcomes has become increasingly recognized, the most important properties of coupled human-natural epidemic systems are still not well understood. We develop a theoretical model for adaptive, optimal control of the effective social contact rate using traditional epidemic modeling tools and a utility function with delayed information. This utility function trades off the population-wide contact rate with the expected cost and risk of increasing infections. Our analytical and computational analysis of this simple discrete-time deterministic strategic model reveals the existence of an endemic equilibrium, oscillatory dynamics around this equilibrium under some parametric conditions, and complex dynamic regimes that shift under small parameter perturbations. These results support the supposition that infectious disease dynamics under adaptive behavior change may have an indifference point, may produce oscillatory dynamics without other forcing, and constitute complex adaptive systems with associated dynamics. Implications for any epidemic in which adaptive behavior influences infectious disease dynamics include an expectation of fluctuations, for a considerable time, around a quasi-equilibrium that balances public health and economic priorities, that shows multiple peaks and surges in some scenarios, and that implies a high degree of uncertainty in mathematical projections.

34226821	Evaluation of government strategies against COVID-19 pandemic using q-rung orthopair fuzzy TOPSIS method. The COVID-19 outbreak, which emerged in China and continues to spread rapidly all over the world, has brought with it increasing numbers of cases and deaths. Governments have suffered serious damage and losses not only in the field of health but also in many other fields. This has directed governments to adopt and implement various strategies in their communities. However, only a few countries succeed partially from the strategies implemented while other countries have failed. In this context, it is necessary to identify the most important strategy that should be implemented by governments. A decision problem based on the decisions of many experts, with some contradictory and multiple criteria, should be taken into account in order to evaluate the multiple strategies implemented by various governments. In this study, this decision process is considered as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem that also takes into account uncertainty. For this purpose, q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) are used to allow decision-makers to their assessments in a wider space and to better deal with ambiguous information. Accordingly, two different Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approaches are recommended under the q-ROFS environment and applied to determine the most appropriate strategy. The results of the proposed approaches determine the A1 - Mandatory quarantine and strict isolation strategy as the best strategy. Comparisons with other q-rung orthopair fuzzy MCDM methods and intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method are also presented for the validation of the proposed methods. Besides, sensitivity analyses are conducted to check the robustness of the proposed approaches and to observe the effect of the change in the q parameter.	Prevention
34219197	Appendectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy: a multicenter ambispective cohort study by the Italian Society of Endoscopic Surgery and new technologies (the CRAC study). Major surgical societies advised using non-operative management of appendicitis and suggested against laparoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis is that a significant reduction in the number of emergent appendectomies was observed during the pandemic, restricted to complex cases. The study aimed to analyse emergent surgical appendectomies during pandemic on a national basis and compare it to the same period of the previous year. This is a multicentre, retrospective, observational study investigating the outcomes of patients undergoing emergent appendectomy in March-April 2019 vs March-April 2020. The primary outcome was the number of appendectomies performed, classified according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) score. Secondary outcomes were the type of surgical technique employed (laparoscopic vs open) and the complication rates. One thousand five hundred forty one patients with acute appendicitis underwent surgery during the two study periods. 1337 (86.8%) patients met the inclusion criteria: 546 (40.8%) patients underwent surgery for acute appendicitis in 2020 and 791 (59.2%) in 2019. According to AAST, patients with complicated appendicitis operated in 2019 were 30.3% vs 39.9% in 2020 (p = 0.001). We observed an increase in the number of post-operative complications in 2020 (15.9%) compared to 2019 (9.6%) (p < 0.001). The following determinants increased the likelihood of complication occurrence: undergoing surgery during 2020 (+ 67%), the increase of a unit in the AAST score (+ 26%), surgery performed > 24 h after admission (+ 58%), open surgery (+ 112%) and conversion to open surgery (+ 166%). In Italian hospitals, in March and April 2020, the number of appendectomies has drastically dropped. During the first pandemic wave, patients undergoing surgery were more frequently affected by more severe appendicitis than the previous year's timeframe and experienced a higher number of complications. Trial registration number and date: Research Registry ID 5789, May 7th, 2020.	Prevention
34203847	"COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance, Hesitancy, and Resistancy among University Students in France. The objectives were to explore, among university students, the level of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and resistancy and to determine the motivations and barriers, and the reasons that may change student vaccination decision making. An online observational cross-sectional study was conducted among students of a French university in January 2021 with questions about the intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19, the motivations and the barriers. The convenience sample included 3089 students, with a mean of age of 20.3 (SD = 1.9). To the question on the intention to vaccinate against the COVID-19, 58.0% of students reported that they would choose to have a vaccination, 17.0% reported that they would not and 25.0% were not sure. The main motivations for vaccine acceptance were ""I don't want to transmit COVID-19 to others"", the main barriers for vaccine resistance or hesitancy were ""I prefer to wait until I have more experience with these new vaccines"". Age, female gender, being in first three years of study, studied sciences courses and neither sciences nor healthcare courses of study were significantly associated with a higher risk of vaccine hesitancy or resistancy. Self-estimated knowledge of conventional vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines, and confidence in efficiency and safety of conventional vaccination were associated with a lower risk of vaccine hesitancy or resistancy. It is relevant to disseminate evidence-based interventions to promote COVID-19 vaccine acceptability for college students, especially for the students in neither sciences nor healthcare courses of study, as college students will soon be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine."

34293833	Increase in SARS-CoV-2 infected biomedical waste among low middle-income countries: environmental sustainability and impact with health implications. Studies have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious disease, with global deaths rising to about 360,438 as of 28 May 2020. Different countries have used various approaches such as lockdown, social distancing, maintenance of personal hygiene, and increased establishment of testing and isolation centers to manage the pandemic. Poor biomedical waste (BMW) management, treatment, and disposal techniques, especially SARS-CoV-2 infected BMW, may threaten the environmental and public health in most developing countries and, by extension, impact the economic status of individuals and the nation at large. This may increase the potential for the transmission of air/blood body fluid-borne pathogens, increase the growth of microorganisms, risk of mutagenesis, and upsurge of more virulent strain. In contrast, uncontrolled substandard burning could increase the potential spread of nosocomial infection and environmental exposure to toxic organic compounds, heavy metals, radioactive, and genotoxic bio-aerosols which might be present in the gaseous, liquid, and solid by-products. The paucity of understanding of pathophysiology and management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has also necessitated the need to put in place appropriate disposal techniques to cater for the sudden increase in the global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and pharmaceutical drugs to manage the pandemic and to reduce the risk of preventable infection by the waste. Therefore, there is a need for adequate sensitization, awareness, and environmental monitoring of the impacts of improper handling of SARS-CoV-2 infected BMWs. Hence, this review aimed to address the issues relating to the improper management of increased SARS-CoV-2 infected BMW in low middle-income countries (LMICs).	Prevention
34214214	Delayed presentation of children to the emergency department during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy: Area-based cohort study. AIM: To ascertain a delay in attendances to the emergency department (ED) during 2020 lockdown. METHODS: Area-based cohort study on paediatric (0-15 years) attendances resulting in hospital admission in Tuscany, Italy, in February-May 2020, and the corresponding periods in 2018-19. We analysed times from symptom onset to arrival, the odds of arriving late (>90th centile of time) and paediatricians' judgements of a late presentation by logistic models. RESULTS: As expected, ED attendance fell sharply (-62%) in 2020 vs 2018-19. As for cases studied (455 in 2020 and 1161 in 2018-19), we documented a delay in arrival to the ED in 2020 versus 2018-19 for several groups of diagnoses, namely gastroenteritis, sepsis, wounds, burns and infections overall. Time to presentation over 90th centile was also higher in 2020 (odds ratio, OR: 1.44; 95% confidence interval: 1.00, 2.06), as were paediatricians' judgements of a late arrival (18.9% of cases in 2020 vs. 13.4% in 2018-19; OR: 1.58; 1.14, 2.19) CONCLUSION: In a population-based cohort, delayed attendances to ED ascertained both subjectively and objectively convey the message to families and to paediatricians to seek hospital care in case of severe or unremitting symptoms and not to wait longer than they normally would.

The habit of finger-licking is an insanitary habit observed everywhere including hospital wards and other medical facilities, among providers and other staff members. It is an enduring habit that has been present before and during the pandemic and will continue unless serious notice of it is taken. Herein, we illustrate the risks imposed by this everyday habit on individuals practicing it and on surrounding people, we describe the challenges with prior attempts to defeat this habit, and we explain how the face mask can eliminate this ever-lasting habit.

34346709	Overlapping of Independent SARS-CoV-2 Nosocomial Transmissions in a Complex Outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreaks in the first COVID-19 wave were likely associated with a shortage of personal protective equipment and scarce indications on control measures. Having covered these limitations, updates on current SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreaks are required. We carried out an in-depth analysis of a 27-day nosocomial outbreak in a gastroenterology ward in our hospital, potentially involving 15 patients and 3 health care workers. Patients had stayed in one of three neighboring rooms in the ward. The severity of the infections in six of the cases and a high fatality rate made the clinicians suspect the possible involvement of a single virulent strain persisting in those rooms. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the strains from 12 patients and 1 health care worker revealed an unexpected complexity. Five different SARS-CoV-2 strains were identified, two infecting a single patient each, ruling out their relationship with the outbreak; the remaining three strains were involved in three independent, overlapping, limited transmission clusters with three, three, and five cases. Whole-genome sequencing was key to understand the complexity of this outbreak. IMPORTANCE We report a complex epidemiological scenario of a nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak in the second wave, based on WGS analysis. Initially, standard epidemiological findings led to the assumption of a homogeneous outbreak caused by a single SARS-CoV-2 strain. The discriminatory power of WGS offered a strikingly different perspective consisting of five introductions of different strains, with only half of them causing secondary cases in three independent overlapping clusters. Our study exemplifies how complex the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the nosocomial setting during the second COVID-19 wave occurred and leads to extending the analysis of outbreaks beyond the initial epidemiological assumptions.

34199184	The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Perception of Health and Treatment-Related Issues among Patients with Phenylketonuria in Poland-The Results of a National Online Survey. There is agreement that the pandemic has affected the healthcare system and behaviour of patients. This study aims to identify problems encountered by patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) and their parents/caregivers during the six-week pandemic lockdown in Poland (15 March to 30 April 2020). To determine the factors that influenced health and treatment-related issues, as well as the respondents' perception of the impact of the pandemic, study participants were asked to complete a non-validated online questionnaire comprising 31 questions (including 27 single-choice, two multiple-choice and two open-ended ones). A total of 571 patients or their parents completed the questionnaire, with 9.5% of respondents not performing any blood phenylalanine (Phe) test in the analysed period, 21.3% declaring a blood Phe increase, and 15.3% a decrease. Increased problems in contacting the doctor or dietitian were reported by 26.1% of subjects, whereas 39.3% of them felt restricted access to dietary products. Most (63.4%) participants were satisfied with remote contact with their PKU clinic. Better compliance was associated with higher odds of acceptance of remote contact and of reporting fewer problems with contacting the doctor, and with lower odds of missing Phe testing. Self-reported high stress was associated with higher odds of reporting the limited availability of low-Phe products and Phe-free formulas, as well as with increased Phe concentrations and non-PKU-related health problems. These patients also had poor dietary compliance and experienced more problems in contacting specialists. Health and treatment-related problems experienced during the pandemic lockdown were related to a higher intensity of stress in patient's family and worse therapy compliance before the pandemic. Previous experience of remote visits resulted in a better perception of this method of contact. It seems that this form of communication should be popularized and improved to increase therapy effectiveness in case of different limitations in the future. Special attention should be paid to vulnerable patients who may be at extra risk when the provision of standard care is affected.	Prevention
34354045	Low level of plasminogen increases risk for mortality in COVID-19 patients. The pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and especially of its complications is still not fully understood. In fact, a very high number of patients with COVID-19 die because of thromboembolic causes. A role of plasminogen, as precursor of fibrinolysis, has been hypothesized. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between plasminogen levels and COVID-19-related outcomes in a population of 55 infected Caucasian patients (mean age: 69.8 +/- 14.3, 41.8% female). Low levels of plasminogen were significantly associated with inflammatory markers (CRP, PCT, and IL-6), markers of coagulation (D-dimer, INR, and APTT), and markers of organ dysfunctions (high fasting blood glucose and decrease in the glomerular filtration rate). A multidimensional analysis model, including the correlation of the expression of coagulation with inflammatory parameters, indicated that plasminogen tended to cluster together with IL-6, hence suggesting a common pathway of activation during disease's complication. Moreover, low levels of plasminogen strongly correlated with mortality in COVID-19 patients even after multiple adjustments for presence of confounding. These data suggest that plasminogen may play a pivotal role in controlling the complex mechanisms beyond the COVID-19 complications, and may be useful both as biomarker for prognosis and for therapeutic target against this extremely aggressive infection.

34218350	Systematic Review of Antiphospholipid Antibodies in COVID-19 Patients: Culprits or Bystanders? PURPOSE OF REVIEW: COVID-19 patients have a procoagulant state with a high prevalence of thrombotic events. The hypothesis of an involvement of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) has been suggested by several reports. Here, we reviewed 48 studies investigating aPL in COVID-19 patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Prevalence of Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) ranged from 35% to 92% in ICU patients. Anti-cardiolipin (aCL) IgG and IgM were found in up to 52% and up to 40% of patients respectively. Anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (abeta2-GPI) IgG and IgM were found in up to 39% and up to 34% of patients respectively. Between 1% and 12% of patients had a triple positive aPL profile. There was a high prevalence of abeta2-GPI and aCL IgA isotype. Two cohort studies found few persistent LA but more persistent solid phase assay aPL over time. aPL determination and their potential role is a real challenge for the treatment of this disease.

34130575	The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on addressing common barriers to pharmacy-based point-of-care testing. Introduction: Pharmacy-based point-of-care testing has long had the potential to improve patient access to timely care, but adoption has been slowed by financial and regulatory barriers. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced or temporarily eliminated many of the barriers to pharmacy-based testing. This review examines how the changes brought on by may impact pharmacy-based testing after the pandemic.Areas Covered: This review searched peer-reviewed, lay, and regulatory literature to explore the implementation of pharmacy-based COVID-19 testing. This includes a review of regulatory and financial changes that removed barriers to testing. Additionally, it reviews the literature related to the growth of pharmacy-based testing.Expert Opinion: It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic created an awareness and opportunity for pharmacy-based point-of-care testing. The changes made in response to the pandemic have the potential to increase the role of pharmacy-based testing, but additional regulatory changes and wider pharmacy adoption are still needed to maximize the value of such services.

34211282	Preventive Practice and Associated Factors Toward Coronavirus Disease 19 in Adigrat Town, Northern Ethiopia: Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study. Purpose: The global coronavirus disease 19 pandemic is an unprecedented crisis, unlike any since the end of the Second World War. Yet no successful vaccine or treatment has been reported. Even though increasing the practice of the community is critical to prevent coronavirus disease 19 pandemic, there is limited study in Ethiopia particularly in the study area. Therefore, the study aimed to assess practice and associated factors toward coronavirus disease 19. Objective: To assess the prevalence and associated factors with practice toward coronavirus disease 19 prevention in Adigrat residents, Northern Ethiopia, 2020. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study design was carried out among 421 Adigrat Town residents from September 10 to 20, 2020. Households were selected using systematic sampling technique. To identify determinant factors, binary logistic regression analyses were employed with confidence interval of 95%. To identify statistically signi fi cant factors, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was used. Statisticalsigni fi cance was determined at P-value <0.05. Results: The prevalence of poor practice was 32.2% (95% CI (31.5-38.5%)). Age of 20-29 (AOR=2.1, 95% CI (1.9-6.5)), occupational status of unemployed (AOR=1.5, CI 95% (1.4-1.9)), marital status of unmarried (AOR=1.9, 95% CI (1.2-12.5)), and educational status of cannot read and write (AOR=2.1, 95% CI (2.0-9.3)) were statistically signi fi cant factors toward COVID-19 prevention. Conclusion: The poor practice toward coronavirus disease 19 prevention was significantly high. Age, occupation, marital status, and educational status were significantly associated with the preventive practice toward the coronavirus disease 19. It would be helpful if the health professionals or other volunteers inform the community continuously by giving health educations regarding the preventive ways to increase the practice.	Prevention
34347869	"Online Media Attention Devoted to Flour and Flour-Related Food Safety in 2017 - 2020. In light of extended stay-at-home periods during the COVID-19 pandemic, recent societal trends have revealed an increased use of online media to remain connected. Simultaneously, interests in at-home cooking and baking, particularly of 'comfort foods' have increased. Since flour is a crucial component in many of these products, we analyze how the U.S. public, in social and online media space, references ""flour"" and its use. We also quantify the share of media mentions about flour that are devoted to flour-related food safety risks and/or risk mitigation. It was found that the volume of mentions about flour and its use fluctuate seasonally, often increasing ahead of the winter holiday season (November-December time period). Further, the volume of interest rapidly increased in March 2020 when stay-at-home orders were issued. The share of media devoted to flour-related food safety risks or associated illness were extremely small but generally corresponded with flour recall announcements or other public risk communications. Overall, the interest in flour and its use remains seasonal and predictably related to societal trends, such as increased baking at home during the holidays or 2020 stay-at-home orders. However, awareness of flour-related food safety risks seems largely absent based on online media data collection and analysis, except in immediate reactions to flour recalls. This study suggests that more flour safety education program may be desired to support consumers' informed decision-making."	Prevention
34282250	Understanding small Chinese cities as COVID-19 hotspots with an urban epidemic hazard index. Multiple small- to middle-scale cities, mostly located in northern China, became epidemic hotspots during the second wave of the spread of COVID-19 in early 2021. Despite qualitative discussions of potential social-economic causes, it remains unclear how this unordinary pattern could be substantiated with quantitative explanations. Through the development of an urban epidemic hazard index (EpiRank) for Chinese prefectural districts, we came up with a mathematical explanation for this phenomenon. The index is constructed via epidemic simulations on a multi-layer transportation network interconnecting local SEIR transmission dynamics, which characterizes intra- and inter-city population flow with a granular mathematical description. Essentially, we argue that these highlighted small towns possess greater epidemic hazards due to the combined effect of large local population and small inter-city transportation. The ratio of total population to population outflow could serve as an alternative city-specific indicator of such hazards, but its effectiveness is not as good as EpiRank, where contributions from other cities in determining a specific city's epidemic hazard are captured via the network approach. Population alone and city GDP are not valid signals for this indication. The proposed index is applicable to different epidemic settings and can be useful for the risk assessment and response planning of urban epidemic hazards in China. The model framework is modularized and the analysis can be extended to other nations.	Prevention
34218858	"Combined Effects of Masking and Distance on Aerosol Exposure Potential. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the efficacy of masking and ""social distancing"" on the transmission of airborne particles from a phantom aerosol source (simulating an infected individual) to a nearby target (simulating a healthy bystander) in a well-controlled setting. METHODS: An aerosol was created using monodisperse polystyrene latex beads in place of infectious respiratory secretions. Detection was by aerodynamic particle spectrometry. Both reusable cloth masks and disposable paper masks were studied. Transmission was simulated indoors during a 3-minute interval to eliminate the effect of variable ventilation rate on aerosol exposure. The study commenced on September 16, 2020, and concluded on December 15, 2020. RESULTS: Compared with a baseline of 1-foot separation with no masks employed, particle count was reduced by 84% at 3 feet of separation and 97% at 6 feet. A modest decrease in particle count was observed when only the receiver was masked. The most substantial exposure reduction occurred when the aerosol source was masked (or both parties were masked). When both the source and target were masked, particle count was reduced by more than 99.5% of baseline, regardless of separation distance or which type of mask was employed. CONCLUSION: These results support the principle of layered protection to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, and other respiratory viruses and emphasize the importance of controlling the spread of aerosol at its source. The combination of masking and distancing reduced the exposure to exhaled particulates more than any individual measure. Combined measures remain the most effective way to combat the spread of respiratory infection."	Prevention;Transmission
34133805	Agricultural workers in meatpacking plants presenting to an emergency department with suspected COVID-19 infection are disproportionately Black and Hispanic. OBJECTIVE: Facilities that process and package meat for consumer sale and consumption (meatpacking plants) were early sites of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks. The aim of this study was to characterize the association between meatpacking plant exposure and clinical outcomes among emergency department (ED) patients with COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients presenting to a single ED, from March 1 to May 31, 2020, who had: 1) symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and 2) a COVID-19 test performed. The primary outcome was COVID-19 positivity, and secondary outcomes included hospital admission from the ED, ventilator use, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, hospital length of stay (LOS; <48 or >/=48 h), and mortality. RESULTS: Patients from meatpacking plants were more likely to be Black or Hispanic than the ED patients without this occupational exposure. Patients with a meatpacking plant exposure were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.59 to 3.53) but had similar rates of hospital admission (aRR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.82 to 1.07) and hospital LOS (aRR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.45 to 1.23). There was no significant difference in ventilator use among patients with meatpacking and nonmeatpacking plant exposure (8.2% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.531), ICU admissions (4.1% vs. 12.0%, p = 0.094), and mortality (2.0% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.473). CONCLUSIONS: Workers in meatpacking plants in Iowa had a higher rate of testing positive for COVID-19 but were not more likely to be hospitalized for their illness. These patients were disproportionately Black and Hispanic.	Prevention
34293616	Insourcing and scaling a telemedicine solution in under 2 weeks: Lessons for the digital transformation of health care. The Covid-19 pandemic required rapid scale of telemedicine as well as other digital workflows to maintain access to care while reducing infection risk. Both patients and clinicians who hadn't used telemedicine before were suddenly faced with a multi-step setup process to log into a virtual meeting. Unlike in-person examination rooms, locking a virtual meeting room was more error-prone and posed a risk of multiple patients joining the same online session. There was administrative burden on the practice staff who were generating and manually sending links to patients, and educating patients on device set up was time-consuming and unsustainable. A solution had to be deployed rapidly system-wide, without the usual roll out across months. Our answer was to design and implement a novel EHR-integrated web application called the Switchboard, in just two weeks. The Switchboard leverages a commercial, cloud-based video meeting platform and facilitates an end-to-end virtual care encounter workflow, from pre-visit reminders to post-visit SMS text message-based measurement of patient experience, with tools to extend contact-less workflows to in-person appointments. Over the first 11 months of the pandemic, the in-house platform has been adopted across 6 hospitals and >200 practices, scaled to 8,800 clinicians who at their peak conducted an average of 30,000 telemedicine appointments/week, and enabled over 10,000-20,000 text messages/day to be exchanged through the platform. Furthermore, it enabled our organization to convert from an average of 75% of telehealth visits being conducted via telephone to 75% conducted via video within weeks.	Prevention
34213760	Subtotal colectomy for refractory ulcerative colitis with COVID-19 infection; a first case report in Japan. We report a 60-year-old male who was transferred to our hospital for the operation because of refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). He was diagnosed to be infected with COVID-19 for SARS-CoV-2 PCR test positive at the time of transfer. We determined emergency operation because his general condition was poor such as malnutrition and ADL decline due to exacerbation of UC and air embolization by central venous catheter removal. He underwent subtotal colectomy with a sigmoid mucous fistula and ileostomy. He was well postoperatively. This is a first case report in Japan who underwent an operation for UC with COVID-19 infection.	Case Report
34292670	Population Pharmacokinetics of Favipiravir in Patients with COVID-19. The antiretroviral drug favipiravir inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It has been developed for the treatment of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19). However, its pharmacokinetics in patients with COVID-19 is poorly understood. In this study, we measured favipiravir serum concentration by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and conducted population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis. Thirty-nine patients were enrolled in the study: 33 were administered FPV 1600 mg twice-daily (BID) on the first day followed by 600 mg BID, and 6 were administered FPV 1800 mg BID on the first day followed by 800 mg or 600 mg BID. The median age was 68 years (range, 27-89 years), males were 31 (79.5%), median body surface area (BSA) was 1.72 m(2) (range, 1.11-2.2), and patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at the start of favipiravir was 10 (25.6%). Two-hundred and four serum concentrations were available for pharmacokinetic analysis. A one-compartment model with first-order elimination was used to describe the pharmacokinetics. The estimated mean clearance/bioavailability (CL/F) and distribution volume/bioavailability (V/F) were 5.11 L/h and 41.6 L, respectively. Covariate analysis revealed that CL/F was significantly related to dosage, IMV use, and BSA. Simulation study showed that the 1600 mg/600 mg BID regimen was insufficient for the treatment of COVID-19 targeting EC50 (9.7microg/mL), especially in patients with larger BSA and/or IMV. A higher favipiravir dosage is required for COVID-19, but dose-dependent nonlinear pharmacokinetics may cause an unexpected significant pharmacokinetic change and drug toxicity. Further studies are warranted to explore the optimal favipiravir regimen.	Treatment
34286870	Right ventricular dysfunction and right ventricular-arterial uncoupling at admission increase the in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 disease. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) frequently involves cardiovascular manifestations such as right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and alterations in pulmonary hemodynamics. We evaluated the application of the critical care ultrasonography ORACLE protocol to identify the most frequent alterations and their influence on adverse outcomes, especially those involving the RV (dilatation and dysfunction). METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 204 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted at three centers. Echocardiography and lung ultrasound images were acquired on admission using the ORACLE ultrasonography algorithm. RESULTS: Two-hundred and four consecutive patients were evaluated: 22 (11.9%) demonstrated a fractional shortening of < 35%; 33 (17.1%) a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) of < 17 mm; 26 (13.5%) a tricuspid peak systolic S wave tissue Doppler velocity of < 9.5 cm/sec; 69 (37.5%) a RV basal diameter of > 41 mm; 119 (58.3%) a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) of > 35 mm Hg; and 14 (11%) a TAPSE/PASP ratio of < .31. The in-hospital mortality rate was 37.6% (n = 71). Multiple logistic regression modeling showed that PASP > 35 mm Hg, RV FS of < 35%, TAPSE < 17 mm, RV S wave < 9.5, and TAPSE/PASP ratio < .31 mm/mm Hg were associated with this outcome. PASP and the TAPSE/PASP ratio had the lowest feasibility of being obtained among the investigators (62.2%). CONCLUSION: The presence of RV dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and alteration of the RV-arterial coupling conveys an increased risk of in-hospital mortality in patients presenting with COVID-19 upon admission; therefore, searching for these alterations should be routine. These parameters can be obtained quickly and safely with the ORACLE protocol.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34360358	Prevalence and Factors Associated with the Reuse of Mask during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Nationwide Survey in Taiwan. Mask usage is an effective measure to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) infection; however, mask reuse is not recommended. Studies examining the factors associated with mask reuse during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic are limited. This nationwide survey aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with mask reuse among Taiwanese citizens during the pandemic. From 18 May through 31 May 2020, a computer-assisted telephone interview system was used to randomly select Taiwanese citizens for interview regarding COVID-19-preventive behaviors and knowledge on mask usage. For a total of 1075 participants, the overall mean age was 57.4 years, and 82.2% of participants reported mask reuse during the COVID-19 pandemic. After controlling for other covariates, participants who had a greater knowledge of mask usage or had a high supply of masks were less likely to reuse masks during the pandemic. Moreover, generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis showed that, compared with the participants' mask-wearing behaviors before the COVID-19 pandemic, they were more likely to reuse masks during the pandemic. Thus, it is imperative to educate people on the correct usage of masks. Furthermore, the government should provide sufficient masks to the general population to reduce mask reuse.	Prevention
34286683	Intense and Mild First Epidemic Wave of Coronavirus Disease, The Gambia. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is evolving differently in Africa than in other regions. Africa has lower SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and milder clinical manifestations. Detailed SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic data are needed in Africa. We used publicly available data to calculate SARS-CoV-2 infections per 1,000 persons in The Gambia. We evaluated transmission rates among 1,366 employees of the Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia (MRCG), where systematic surveillance of symptomatic cases and contact tracing were implemented. By September 30, 2020, The Gambia had identified 3,579 SARS-CoV-2 cases, including 115 deaths; 67% of cases were identified in August. Among infections, MRCG staff accounted for 191 cases; all were asymptomatic or mild. The cumulative incidence rate among nonclinical MRCG staff was 124 infections/1,000 persons, which is >80-fold higher than estimates of diagnosed cases among the population. Systematic surveillance and seroepidemiologic surveys are needed to clarify the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Africa.	Prevention;Transmission
34363600	HD5 and LL-37 Inhibit SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Binding to Human ACE2 by Molecular Simulation. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is still spreading all over the world. As reported, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that initializes viral entry into host cells. Previously, the human defensin 5 (HD5) has been experimentally confirmed to be functional against the SARS-CoV-2. The present study proposes a human cathelicidin known as LL37 that strongly binds to the carboxypeptidase domain of human ACE2 compared to HD5. Therefore, LL37 bears a great potential to be tested as an anti-SARS-CoVD-2 peptide. We investigated the molecular interactions formed between the LL37 and ACE2 as well as HD5 and ACE2 tailed by their thermodynamic stability. The MM-PBSA and free energy landscape analysis outcomes confirmed its possible inhibitory effect against the SARS-CoV-2. The results obtained here could help propose a promising therapeutic strategy against the havoc caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections.	Mechanism;Treatment

34334951	"The coSIR model predicts effective strategies to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants with low severity and high transmissibility. Multiple new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads across the globe. However, most epidemic models view the virus as static and unchanging and thus fail to address the consequences of the potential evolution of the virus. Here, we built a competitive susceptible-infected-removed (coSIR) model to simulate the competition between virus strains of differing severities or transmissibility under various virus control policies. The coSIR model predicts that although the virus is extremely unlikely to evolve into a ""super virus"" that causes an increased fatality rate, virus variants with less severe symptoms can lead to potential new outbreaks and can cost more lives over time. The present model also demonstrates that the protocols restricting the transmission of the virus, such as wearing masks and social distancing, are the most effective strategy in reducing total mortality. A combination of adequate testing and strict quarantine is a powerful alternative to policies such as mandatory stay-at-home orders, which may have an enormous negative impact on the economy. In addition, building Mobile Cabin Hospitals can be effective and efficient in reducing the mortality rate of highly infectious virus strains.

34203060	SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence and Neutralizing Antibody Response after the First and Second COVID-19 Pandemic Wave in Croatia. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus with a pandemic spread. So far, a total of 349,910 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 7687 deaths were reported in Croatia. We analyzed the seroprevalence and neutralizing (NT) antibody response in the Croatian general population after the first (May-July 2020) and second (December 2020-February 2021) pandemic wave. Initial serological testing was performed using a commercial ELISA, with confirmation of reactive samples by a virus neutralization test (VNT). A significant difference in the overall seroprevalence rate was found after the first (ELISA 2.2%, VNT 0.2%) and second waves (ELISA 25.1%, VNT 18.7%). Seropositive individuals were detected in all age groups, with significant differences according to age. The lowest prevalence of NT antibodies was documented in the youngest (<10 years; 16.1%) and the oldest (60-69/70+ years; 16.0% and 12.8%, respectively) age groups. However, these age groups showed the highest median NT titers (32-64). In other groups, seropositivity varied from 19.3% to 21.5%. A significant weak positive correlation between binding antibody level as detected by ELISA and VNT titer (rho = 0.439, p < 0.001) was observed. SARS-CoV-2 NT antibody titers seem to be age-related, with the highest NT activity in children under 10 years and individuals above 50 years.	Diagnosis
34219854	Acute Bronchiolitis During The Covid-19 Pandemic. INTRODUCTION: The autumn and winter bronchiolitis epidemics have virtually disappeared in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.Our objectives were characterise bronchiolitis during fourth quarter of 2020 and the role played by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Prospective multi-centre study performed in Madrid (Spain) between October and December 2020 including all children admitted with acute bronchiolitis. Clinical data were collected and multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were hospitalised with bronchiolitis during the study period: 28 corresponded to rhinovirus (RV), 4 to SARS-CoV-2, and 1 had both types of infection. SAR-CoV-2 bronchiolitis were comparable to RV bronchiolitis except for a shorter hospital stay. A significant decrease in the admission rate for bronchiolitis was found and no RSV was isolated. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection rarely causes acute bronchiolitis and it is not associated with a severe clinical course. During COVID-19 pandemic period there was a marked decrease in bronchiolitis cases.	Diagnosis

However, in our population, predominant in elderly Caucasian patients, most biopsied pathology since the beginning of the pandemic has been IgA nephritis or Schonlein-Henoch purpura.Since the description of the first case of this entity after SARS-CoV-2 infection by our research group, three more cases have arisen, which are described in the following article. In contrast to the rest of IgA vasculitis cases reported, our patients presented more renal function deterioration and all of them required immunosupresive therapy. Moreover, some showed incomplete recovery of renal function.This case series strengthens the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be another trigger of this pathology.	Case Report
34334899	Pulmonary embolism in coronavirus disease 2019: the silent killer. Background: Pulmonary embolism (PE) has been identified as one of the deadliest complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Western literature reminds us of the high prevalence of PE in COVID. Here, we report a series of 13 cases of PE diagnosed and managed at our hospital. Methods: Retrospective analysis of medical records of 13 cases of PE admitted at our hospital from February 1, 2020, to September 31, 2020, were done. Their clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were assessed in detail. Results: Computed tomography pulmonary arteriography was used to make the diagnosis in eight patients (61.53%), and clinical findings with corroborative ultrasound and laboratory parameters were used to label PE in five patients (38.46%). Five patients were hemodynamically unstable, requiring thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, and four patients (30.76%) suffered a fatal outcome. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a highly prothrombotic state, and all physicians should keep a high vigilance for PE. All hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially those admitted in ICU, should be on prophylactic anticoagulation and, if there is any worsening, should be started on therapeutic regimen. Patients at the time of discharge should be switched to oral anticoagulation, which should be continued for at least 3-6 months.	Case Report
34291552	Cellular and humoral immune response after mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in liver and heart transplant recipients. Recently published studies have found an impaired immune response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in solid organ recipients. However, most of these studies have not assessed immune cellular responses in liver and heart transplant recipients. We prospectively studied heart and liver transplant recipients eligible for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Patients with past history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2 detectable antibodies (IgM or IgG) were excluded. We assessed IgM/IgG antibodies and ELISpot against the S protein 4 weeks after receiving the second dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. Side effects, troponin I, liver tests and anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies (DSA) were also assessed. A total of 58 liver and 46 heart recipients received two doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine. Median time from transplantation to vaccination was 5.4 years (IQR 0.3-27). Sixty-four percent of the patients developed SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies and 79% S-ELISpot positivity. Ninety percent of recipients developed either humoral or cellular response (87% in heart recipients and 93% in liver recipients). Factors associated with vaccine unresponsiveness were hypogammaglobulinemia and vaccination during the first year after transplantation. Local and systemic side effects were mild or moderate, and none presented DSA or graft dysfunction after vaccination. Ninety percent of our patients did develop humoral or cellular responses to mRNA-1273 vaccine. Factors associated with vaccine unresponsiveness were hypogammaglobulinemia and vaccination during the first year after transplantation, highlighting the need to further protect these patients.

34215218	Perinatal health care access, childbirth concerns, and birthing decision-making among pregnant people in California during COVID-19. BACKGROUND: During public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic, access to adequate healthcare is crucial for providing for the health and wellbeing of families. Pregnant and postpartum people are a particularly vulnerable subgroup to consider when studying healthcare access. Not only are perinatal people likely at higher risk for illness, mortality, and morbidity from COVID-19 infection, they are also at higher risk for negative outcomes due to delayed or inadequate access to routine care. METHODS: We surveyed 820 pregnant people in California over two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) a 'non-surge' wave (June 2020, n = 433), and (2) during a 'surge' in cases (December 2020, n = 387) to describe current access to perinatal healthcare, as well as concerns and decision-making regarding childbirth, over time. We also examined whether existing structural vulnerabilities - including acute financial insecurity and racial/ethnic minoritization - are associated with access, concerns, and decision-making over these two waves. RESULTS: Pregnant Californians generally enjoyed more access to, and fewer concerns about, perinatal healthcare during the winter of 2020-2021, despite surging COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, as compared to those surveyed during the COVID-19 'lull' in the summer of 2020. However, across 'surge' and 'non-surge' pandemic circumstances, marginalized pregnant people continued to fare worse - especially those facing acute financial difficulty, and racially minoritized individuals identifying as Black or Indigenous. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to understand whether and how shifting community transmission and infection rates may impact access to perinatal healthcare. Targeting minoritized and financially insecure communities for increased upstream perinatal healthcare supports are promising avenues to blunt the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant people in California.

34288064	A role for T-cell exhaustion in Long COVID-19 and severe outcomes for several categories of COVID-19 patients. Unusual mortality rate differences and symptoms have been experienced by COVID-19 patients, and the postinfection symptoms called Long COVID-19 have also been widely experienced. A substantial percentage of COVID-19-infected individuals in specific health categories have been virtually asymptomatic, several other individuals in the same health categories have exhibited several unusual symptoms, and yet other individuals in the same health categories have fatal outcomes. It is now hypothesized that these differences in mortality rates and symptoms could be caused by a SARS-CoV-2 virus infection acting together with one or more latent pathogen infections in certain patients, through mutually beneficial induced immune cell dysfunctions, including T-cell exhaustion. A latent pathogen infection likely to be involved is the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which infects approximately one third of the global human population. Furthermore, certain infections and cancers that cause T-cell exhaustion can also explain the more severe outcomes of other COVID-19 patients having several disease and cancer comorbidities.

34209161	COVID-19 Community Transmission among Healthcare Workers at a Tertiary Care Cardiac Center. Aim: To determine the frequency, mode of transmission, and outcome of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among healthcare workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care cardiac center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methods: This is a retrospective study of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected HCWs and was conducted from 2 March to 31 December 2020. Data related to the presence of COVID-19 symptoms, mode of transmission, hospitalization, and mortality were collected from the patients' medical records. Results: Of the 4462 patients tested for COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 203 (4.5%) HCWs were positive; of these, 125 (61.6%) were males, and the most common age group was <40 years. The most commonly encountered health professionals were nurses (74, 36.4%), followed by therapists/technicians (48, 23.6%), housekeepers (25, 12.3%), and physicians (21, 10.4%). The majority (184, 90.6%) of the HCWs contracted COVID-19 in the community, and only 19 (9.4%) were healthcare-associated infections. Of the infected HCWs, 169 (83.3%) had mild symptoms and were managed in home isolation. The most common symptoms were fever (128, 63.1%), body ache (124, 61.8%), headache (113, 55.7%), dry cough (123, 60.6%), sore throat (97, 47.8%), body weakness (97, 47.8%), and fatigue (94, 46.3%). Comparing males and females, there was a significantly higher number of female nurses; in contrast, there was a higher number of male physicians, housekeepers, therapists/technicians, and other specialty HCWs. A significantly lower number of nurses, therapists/technicians were infected in the >/=40 years age group compared to <40 years. Furthermore, a significantly higher difference was observed among non-Saudi nurses compared to Saudi nurses. No mortality was documented among the included HCWs. Conclusions: In the largest tertiary cardiac center in KSA, most HCWs who contracted COVID-19 developed mild symptoms; nurses and those aged <40 years were most commonly infected, and most infections were acquired in the community. HCWs' adherence to mitigation measures outside of the workplace is vital to curb the current pandemic and decrease nosocomial transmission risk.	Diagnosis;Transmission
34222132	A possible protective role for Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy in urinary bladder cancer in the era of COVID-19: a brief report. Given the systemic immunogenic effects of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy in patients with bladder cancer and its non-specific immunogenic effects in viral respiratory diseases, we aimed to study severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in bladder cancer patients with a history of BCG therapy. In the present study, all bladder cancer survivors with a history of BCG therapy were identified and included in the study according to the data recovered from the UORC (Uro-Oncology Research Center) registry database. These patients were followed up in terms of acquiring coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among the studied patients, 102 eligible bladder cancer patients with a history of BCG therapy entered the study. The males constituted the majority of the patients (86.3%), and more than half of the study population (55.9%) were above 65 years old. Among the understudy patients, 12.7% were confirmed for COVID-19. The study results did not show a statistically significant association between the time and number of BCG therapy courses and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although no statistically significant association was observed between receiving BCG therapy and developing COVID-19, the infection rate in patients who had recently received BCG therapy was lower than those who had received therapy more than a year ago.

34351367	COVID-19 Ocular Prophylaxis: The Potential Role of Ozonated-Oils in Liposome Eyedrop Gel. Purpose: To assess whether ozonated-oil in liposome eyedrop gel (OED) could be used to prevent the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in an in vitro infection model. Methods: First, we tested the efficacy of OED on in vitro cell regeneration and dry eye resolution in human corneal epithelial cells (hCE-2). Second, we assessed the in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection efficacy of OED using Vero E6 cells. Tissues were examined to assess different parameters: morphology, histology, and mRNA expression at 24 hours after treatment. Results: OED could restore 50% of the scratch in the monolayer of hCE-2 cells in vitro compared with the 25% obtained with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS). At 24 hours after treatment with OED, the number of microvilli and the mucin network were restored, as observed using scanning electron microscopy. In Vero E6 cells infected with a primary SARS-CoV-2 strain and treated with OED two times/day, viral replication was found to be inhibited, with a 70-fold reduction observed at 72 hours after infection compared with that under the untreated and PBS-treated conditions. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the ocular surface should not be ignored. Although the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 conjunctivitis infection is low, the need for a barrier to prevent possible viral infection is warranted. OED treatment may prevent the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 72 hours of twice-daily applications. Translational Relevance: Dry eye condition might be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and OED treatment may have a preventive role.	Transmission;Prevention
34358292	Viral Load of SARS-CoV-2 in Respiratory Aerosols Emitted by COVID-19 Patients while Breathing, Talking, and Singing. BACKGROUND: Multiple SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events suggest that aerosols play an important role in driving the COVID-19 pandemic. To better understand how airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs, we sought to determine viral loads within coarse (>5mum) and fine (</=5mum) respiratory aerosols produced when breathing, talking, and singing. METHODS: Using a G-II exhaled breath collector, we measured viral RNA in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients during 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking, and 15 minutes of singing. RESULTS: Thirteen participants (59%) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic and 1 presymptomatic patient. Viral loads ranged from 63-5,821 N gene copies per expiratory activity per participant, with high person-to-person variation. Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA. Two participants, sampled on day 3 of illness, accounted for 52% of the total viral load. Overall, 94% of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies were emitted by talking and singing. Interestingly, 7 participants emitted more virus from talking than singing. Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85% of the viral load detected in our study. Virus cultures were negative. CONCLUSIONS: Fine aerosols produced by talking and singing contain more SARS-CoV-2 copies than coarse aerosols and may play a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Exposure to fine aerosols, especially indoors, should be mitigated. Isolating viable SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory aerosol samples remains challenging, and whether this can be more easily accomplished for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is an urgent enquiry necessitating larger-scale studies.

34205851	Stem Cell Theory of Cancer: Implications of a Viral Etiology in Certain Malignancies. In 1911, Peyton Rous (Nobel Prize winner in 1966) demonstrated that a virus (i.e., RSV) caused cancer in chickens. In 1976, Bishop and Varmus (Nobel Prize winners in 1989) showed that the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes was actually normal cellular genes (i.e., proto-oncogenes). In this article, we revisit the role viruses play in the genetic origin of cancer. We review a link between viruses or cancer and autoimmunity in an alternative stem cell origin of cancer. We propose that a virus is more likely to cause cancer when it infects a progenitor stem-like cell rather than a progeny differentiated cell. We postulate that both known (e.g., HBV and HPV) and novel viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) pose an imminent threat in the emergence of chronic viral diseases as well as virally induced malignancies. Knowing the origin of cancer has profound implications on our current conception and perception of cancer. It affects our conduct in cancer research and our delivery of cancer care. It would be ironic if viruses turn out to be a useful tool and an ideal means in our quest to verify a genetic versus stem cell origin of cancer. When it pertains, oncology recapitulates ontogeny; although genetic makeup is pivotal, cellular context may be paramount to elucidating a stem cell origin of cancer.	Mechanism
34211037	The RNA sensor MDA5 detects SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human cells respond to infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by producing cytokines including type I and III interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory factors such as IL6 and TNF. IFNs can limit SARS-CoV-2 replication but cytokine imbalance contributes to severe COVID-19. We studied how cells detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. We report that the cytosolic RNA sensor MDA5 was required for type I and III IFN induction in the lung cancer cell line Calu-3 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Type I and III IFN induction further required MAVS and IRF3. In contrast, induction of IL6 and TNF was independent of the MDA5-MAVS-IRF3 axis in this setting. We further found that SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibited the ability of cells to respond to IFNs. In sum, we identified MDA5 as a cellular sensor for SARS-CoV-2 infection that induced type I and III IFNs.	Mechanism
34351922	Preterm birth is not associated with asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection per se: Pre-pregnancy state is what matters. Evidence for the real impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on preterm birth is unclear, as available series report composite pregnancy outcomes and/or do not stratify patients according to disease severity. The purpose of the research was to determine the real impact of asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection on preterm birth not due to maternal respiratory failure. This case-control study involved women admitted to Sant Anna Hospital, Turin, for delivery between 20 September 2020 and 9 January 2021. The cumulative incidence of Coronavirus disease-19 was compared between preterm birth (case group, n = 102) and full-term delivery (control group, n = 127). Only women with spontaneous or medically-indicated preterm birth because of placental vascular malperfusion (pregnancy-related hypertension and its complications) were included. Current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by nasopharyngeal swab testing and detection of IgM/IgG antibodies in blood samples. A significant difference in the cumulative incidence of Coronavirus disease-19 between the case (21/102, 20.5%) and the control group (32/127, 25.1%) (P= 0.50) was not observed, although the case group was burdened by a higher prevalence of three known risk factors (body mass index > 24.9, asthma, chronic hypertension) for severe Coronavirus disease-19. Logistic regression analysis showed that asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection was not an independent predictor of spontaneous and medically-indicated preterm birth due to pregnancy-related hypertension and its complications (0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-1.43). Pregnant patients without comorbidities need to be reassured that asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection does not increase the risk of preterm delivery. Preterm birth and severe Coronavirus disease-19 share common risk factors (i.e., body mass index > 24.9, asthma, chronic hypertension), which may explain the high rate of indicated preterm birth due to maternal conditions reported in the literature.

34211654	Improving Emergency Room Utilization During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Telemedicine Social Determinants of Health Outreach Approach. High-risk patients over the age of 65, who had chronic medical conditions, and had not yet had a primary care visit within 2020 were identified. A subgroup of patients participated in a survey to assess social determinants of health (SDOH) in the setting of a pandemic. Outcomes of those who participated in the survey, and those who did not participate were compared. Notably, those who were surveyed and lived within zip codes with low socioeconomic status had significantly decreased emergency department visits, which we defined as a discharge from the emergency department without hospitalization, as compared to those who did not receive outreach. Rates of inpatient hospitalization did not differ significantly. These findings suggest that patient outreach to evaluate SDOH during a pandemic leads to more appropriate emergency department and hospital resource utilization. This finding is particularly impactful given the current pandemic, which may place a strain on emergency department, and healthcare resources.	Prevention
34221756	Safety Precautions for Self-Performed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Tests: A Case of a Swallowed Swab. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens collected by swabbing are the pillars of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostics. Commercially available rapid antigen tests and self-sampling polymerase chain reaction services have made specimen collection available anytime and anywhere in nonmedical settings. In this study, we report the case of a 45-year-old man who accidentally ingested a swab during self-performed SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen testing. Imaging studies revealed an elongated foreign body in the stomach. Urgent gastroscopy confirmed the presence of the swabbing applicator in the gastric lumen, which was retrieved using a loop without any complications. Millions of SARS-CoV-2 tests are performed daily, of which an increasing proportion are performed by laypeople. Foreign bodies account for a particular set of complications, which can be avoided by cautious sampling and using the correct technique. Radiopaque labeling of instruments would be useful. Otherwise, rare serious events can occur that may require immediate medical interventions.	Case Report
34212710	Knowledge, attitudes and practices during the second wave of COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional study from various perspectives. Aim To investigate knowledge, attitudes and practice towards COVID-19 among selected population. Methods An anonymous online questionnaire based on a Chinese study was distributed via online social media platforms among general population of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, India, Kosovo and Romania. Results In total 1032 subjects, predominately females, 615 (59.6%) with a mean age of 31.23+/-12.94 years, single, 705 (68.3%), with high school degree or lower, 469 (45.4%), students, 528 (51.1%) and living in an urban environment, 824 (79.8%), have completed the survey. The median knowledge score was 10.0 (range 0-12). Being male (beta: -0.437; p=0.003) and older (beta: -0.028; p<0.001) were associated with lower knowledge scores, while being single (beta: 1.026; p<0.001) and mental labour employee (beta: 0.402; p=0.032) were associated with higher knowledge scores. The vast majority of subjects had not visited crowded places, 630 (61.0%) and wearing masks when they were going out, 928 (89.9%). Being female (OR=0.731; p=0.022), having higher knowledge scores (OR=0.929; p=0.017) and being a mental labour employee (OR=0.713; p=0.031) decreased the exposure to crowded places. High school or lower education level (OR=0.616; p=0.024) decreased the action of wearing a mask in public places, while higher knowledge scores (OR=1.112; p=0.013) increased it. Conclusion Our study suggests that residents of the selected regions have had good knowledge, pessimistic attitudes and relatively appropriate practices towards COVID-19 during the second wave of the outbreak.

34219927	COVID-19 and dermatological personal protective equipment considerations. Cutaneous injury and irritation among health care workers has substantially risen during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a field already laden with skin-induced injury and irritation due to high levels of handwashing and glove wearing, increases have been reported in handwashing-induced xerosis, irritant dermatitis, and contact dermatitis from N95 respirators and other surgical masks. Masks, goggles, face shields, and gloves all potentially create abrasions from long hours of use, leading to itching, pain, and aggravation of underlying skin conditions. Personal protective equipment (PPE)-related skin injury can be serious, and the American Academy of Dermatology has released recommendations on preventing and treating occupationally induced dermatologic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. These are reviewed and discussed in conjunction with overarching guidelines for mitigating the spread of the virus.	Prevention
34205809	Nine Months of COVID-19 Pandemic in Europe: A Comparative Time Series Analysis of Cases and Fatalities in 35 Countries. (1) Background: to describe the dynamic of the pandemic across 35 European countries over a period of 9 months. (2) Methods: a three-phase time series model was fitted for 35 European countries, predicting deaths based on SARS-CoV-2 incidences. Hierarchical clustering resulted in three clusters of countries. A multiple regression model was developed predicting thresholds for COVID-19 incidences, coupled to death numbers. (3) Results: The model showed strongly connected deaths and incidences during the waves in spring and fall. The corrected case-fatality rates ranged from 2% to 20.7% in the first wave, and from 0.5% to 4.2% in the second wave. If the incidences stay below a threshold, predicted by the regression model (R2=85.0%), COVID-19 related deaths and incidences were not necessarily coupled. The clusters represented different regions in Europe, and the corrected case-fatality rates in each cluster flipped from high to low or vice versa. Severely and less severely affected countries flipped between the first and second wave. (4) Conclusions: COVID-19 incidences and related deaths were uncoupled during the summer but coupled during two waves. Once a country-specific threshold of infections is reached, death numbers will start to rise, allowing health care systems and countries to prepare.	Prevention
34220496	The Impact of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System on Inflammation, Coagulation, and Atherothrombotic Complications, and to Aggravated COVID-19. Atherosclerosis is considered a disease caused by a chronic inflammation, associated with endothelial dysfunction, and several mediators of inflammation are up-regulated in subjects with atherosclerotic disease. Healthy, intact endothelium exhibits an antithrombotic, protective surface between the vascular lumen and vascular smooth muscle cells in the vessel wall. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between anti- and prooxidants, with a subsequent increase of reactive oxygen species, leading to tissue damage. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is of vital importance in the pathobiology of vascular disease. Convincing data indicate that angiotensin II accelerates hypertension and augments the production of reactive oxygen species. This leads to the generation of a proinflammatory phenotype in human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells by the up-regulation of adhesion molecules, chemokines and cytokines. In addition, angiotensin II also seems to increase thrombin generation, possibly via a direct impact on tissue factor. However, the mechanism of cross-talk between inflammation and haemostasis can also contribute to prothrombotic states in inflammatory environments. Thus, blocking of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might be an approach to reduce both inflammatory and thrombotic complications in high-risk patients. During COVID-19, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may be activated. The levels of angiotensin II could contribute to the ongoing inflammation, which might result in a cytokine storm, a complication that significantly impairs prognosis. At the outbreak of COVID-19 concerns were raised about the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker drugs in patients with COVID-19 and hypertension or other cardiovascular comorbidities. However, the present evidence is in favor of continuing to use of these drugs. Based on experimental evidence, blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might even exert a potentially protective influence in the setting of COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment

34211647	Investigational study of the clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Background: The COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease that impacted HealthCare System worldwide and patients undergoing elective surgical procedures is associated with a high mortality rate and a complicated perioperative course. Methods: A retrospective observational study, the research design was conducted utilizing the RedCap ACS COVID-19 Registry and Cerner EMR. The intent of this design is to create statistical information about confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in an academic institution in Brooklyn, New York from March to May 2020. Results: A total of 1413 patients were included in the final analysis. Of the 1413 patients, 520 Expired, 40.5% were males, and 33% were females, p = 0.004. Male patients had high mortality at a rate that is statistically significant. For race of those 'Expired', 38.3% white, 34.2% Black, 28.2% Asian, and Unknown 43.6%, showing statistical significance at p = 0.050. The most common co-morbidities for those not-Expired versus Expired: DM, 44.6% expired versus 55.6% not-expired, HTN, 77.1% versus 22.9%, and CAD, 47.9% versus 52.1%. Comparing the data of COVID-19 patients without surgery and with those who had surgery, it was observed that 53% of those who did not have surgery went 'Home' versus 38.6%, of those with surgery who could not. Further examining those without surgery versus those with surgery: 3.4% versus 13.3% discharge to 'Rehab', for 'Other discharge' destinations 5.9% versus 14.5%, and for 'Expired' 37.1% versus 31.3%. Overall, the presence of surgery had a significant impact on COVID-19 patients discharge destinations at p = < 0.001. Conclusions: The implications of change in the setting of our current clinical practice therefore require forbearance, training, preparedness, and education to efficiently maintain our essential surgical services.

34357135	"Plitidepsin: Mechanisms and Clinical Profile of a Promising Antiviral Agent against COVID-19. Current standard treatment of COVID-19 lacks in effective antiviral options. Plitidepsin, a cyclic depsipeptide authorized in Australia for patients with refractory multiple myeloma, has recently emerged as a candidate anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. The aim of this review was to summarize current knowledge on plitidepsin's clinical profile, anti-tumour and anti-SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms and correlate this with available or anticipated, preclinical or clinical evidence on the drug's potential for COVID-19 treatment.PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL, clinicaltrials.gov, medRxiv and bioRxiv databases were searched.Plitidepsinexerts its anti-tumour and antiviral properties primarily through acting on isoforms of the host cell's eukaryotic-translation-elongation-factor-1-alpha (eEF1A). Through inhibiting eEF1A and therefore translation of necessary viral proteins, it behaves as a ""host-directed"" anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. In respect to its potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties, the drug has demonstrated superior ex vivo efficacy compared to other host-directed agents and remdesivir, and it might retain its antiviral effect against the more transmittable B.1.1.7 variant. Its well-studied safety profile, also in combination with dexamethasone, may accelerate its repurposing chances for COVID-19 treatment. Preliminary findings in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, have suggested potential safety and efficacy of plitidepsin, in terms of viral load reduction and clinical resolution. However, the still incomplete understanding of its exact integration into host cell-SARS-CoV-2 interactions, its intravenous administration exclusively purposing it for hospital settings the and precocity of clinical data are currently considered its chief deficits. A phase III trial is being planned to compare the plitidepsin-dexamethasone regimen to the current standard of care only in moderately affected hospitalized patients. Despite plitidepsin's preclinical efficacy, current clinical evidence is inadequate for its registration in COVID-19 patients.Therefore, multicentre trials on the drug's efficacy, potentially also studying populations of emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages, are warranted."

34225491	Methyltransferase-like 3 Modulates Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 RNA N6-Methyladenosine Modification and Replication. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing global public crisis. Although viral RNA modification has been reported based on the transcriptome architecture, the types and functions of RNA modification are still unknown. In this study, we evaluated the roles of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification in SARS-CoV-2. Our methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) and Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA contained m(6)A modification. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection not only increased the expression of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) but also altered its distribution. Modification of METTL3 expression by short hairpin RNA or plasmid transfection for knockdown or overexpression, respectively, affected viral replication. Furthermore, the viral key protein RdRp interacted with METTL3, and METTL3 was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the presence of RdRp. RdRp appeared to modulate the sumoylation and ubiquitination of METTL3 via an unknown mechanism. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that the host m(6)A modification complex interacted with viral proteins to modulate SARS-CoV-2 replication. IMPORTANCE Internal chemical modifications of viral RNA play key roles in the regulation of viral replication and gene expression. Although potential internal modifications have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the function of the SARS-CoV-2 N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification in the viral life cycle is unclear. In the current study, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA underwent m(6)A modification by host m(6)A machinery. SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the expression pattern of methyltransferases and demethylases, while the expression level of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) was linked to the viral replication. Further study showed that METTL3 interacted with viral RNA polymerase RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which influenced not only the distribution but also the posttranslational modification of METTL3. Our study provided evidence that host m(6)A components interacted with viral proteins to modulate viral replication.	Mechanism;Treatment
34285313	"Solar UV-B/A radiation is highly effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2. Solar UV-C photons do not reach Earth's surface, but are known to be endowed with germicidal properties that are also effective on viruses. The effect of softer UV-B and UV-A photons, which copiously reach the Earth's surface, on viruses are instead little studied, particularly on single-stranded RNA viruses. Here we combine our measurements of the action spectrum of Covid-19 in response to UV light, Solar irradiation measurements on Earth during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics, worldwide recorded Covid-19 mortality data and our ""Solar-Pump"" diffusive model of epidemics to show that (a) UV-B/A photons have a powerful virucidal effect on the single-stranded RNA virus Covid-19 and that (b) the Solar radiation that reaches temperate regions of the Earth at noon during summers, is sufficient to inactivate 63% of virions in open-space concentrations (1.5 x 10(3) TCID50/mL, higher than typical aerosol) in less than 2 min. We conclude that the characteristic seasonality imprint displayed world-wide by the SARS-Cov-2 mortality time-series throughout the diffusion of the outbreak (with temperate regions showing clear seasonal trends and equatorial regions suffering, on average, a systematically lower mortality), might have been efficiently set by the different intensity of UV-B/A Solar radiation hitting different Earth's locations at different times of the year. Our results suggest that Solar UV-B/A play an important role in planning strategies of confinement of the epidemics, which should be worked out and set up during spring/summer months and fully implemented during low-solar-irradiation periods."

34286200	How we adapted the T&O inpatient service during the COVID-19 pandemic with physician associates to support the orthopaedic team. Introduction: In March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were increasing demands on medical and intensive care departments in the UK. Medical staff from surgical departments were redeployed. The aim of this study was to determine whether the department was able to maintain standards with the use of the physician associate / medical doctor (PA/MD) model of care. Methods: A mix of questionnaires and audit data was collected prospectively and compared with pre-COVID and the general surgical team which did not have PAs. Results: Sixty-five per cent of responses indicated an improvement compared with pre-COVID conditions and 35% indicated care was the same. The electronic discharge notification audit showed an 89% completion rate for orthopaedics compared with 73% for general surgery. Venous thromboembolism assessment compliance was better compared with general surgery. Conclusion: Overall, the study supports the hypothesis that a PA/MD model of care is non-inferior to a MD-only model of care and was effective.	Prevention
34288729	A Simple RT-PCR Melting temperature Assay to Rapidly Screen for Widely Circulating SARS-CoV-2 Variants. Background. The increased transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) which originated in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7/alpha), South Africa (B1.351/Beta), Brazil (P.1/Gamma), in the United States (B.1.427/429 or Epsilon) and in India (B.1.617.2/Delta) requires a vigorous public health response, including real time strain surveillance on a global scale. Although genome sequencing is the gold standard for identifying these VOCs, it is time consuming and expensive. Here, we describe a simple, rapid and high-throughput reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) melting temperature (Tm) screening assay that identifies the first three major VOCs. Methods. RT-PCR primers and four sloppy molecular beacon (SMB) probes were designed to amplify and detect the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y (A23063T) and E484K (G23012A) mutations and their corresponding wild type sequences. After RT-PCR, the VOCs were identified by a characteristic Tm of each SMB. Assay optimization and testing was performed with RNA from SARS-CoV-2 USA WA1/2020 (WT), B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains. The assay was then validated using clinical samples. Results. The limit of detection (LOD) for both the WT and variants was 4 and 10 genomic copies/reaction for the 501 and 484 codon assays, respectively. The assay was 100% sensitive and 100% specific for identifying the N501Y and E484K mutations in cultured virus and in clinical samples as confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Conclusion. We have developed an RT-PCR melt screening test for the major VOCs which can be used to rapidly screen large numbers of patient samples providing an early warning for the emergence of these variants and a simple way to track their spread.

SARS-CoV-2 vaccination related safety and immunogenicity data in these patients are rare. Methods: In this observational study SARS-CoV-2-seronegative hemodialysis patients were vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA-BNT162b2 vaccine (COMIRNATY((R)) 30 microg) and followed for 90 days. Local and systemic side effects were assessed at every dialysis session during the first post-vaccination week after the first and second vaccine dose. Immunogenicity was determined four weeks after vaccination by quantifying anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG antibodies (LIAISON((R)) SARS-CoV-2-TrimericS IgG chemiluminescent immunoassay) expressed in binding activity units per milliliter (BAU/mL) adapted to the WHO International standard. Results: Fifty patients (32% women, 68% men) with a mean (SD) age of 67.6 (14.8) years were included. Mild local reactions occurred in 38% after the first injection, and in 29.2% with mild, in 2.1% with moderate and in 2.1% with severe degree after the second injection. Systemic reactive events occurred less often, with diarrhea (4% mild, 4% moderate) and fatigue (8% mild) being the most frequent ones. After the first injection 42% of the patients developed a positive response using the assay specific cut-off value of 33.8 binding activity units per milliliter (BAU/mL) with a median (Q1, Q3) anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG concentration of 20.0 (11.7, 51.0) BAU/mL. After the second injection the percentage of seropositive patients increased to 97.9% with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG concentration of 1075 (290.8, 1735) BAU/mL. Higher age and immunosuppression were associated with lower, calcitriol treatment and prior seroconversion to hepatitis B vaccination with significantly higher antibody concentration. Conclusions: The mRNA-BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine appears to be safe and well-tolerated and shows a high immunogenicity in hemodialysis patients.	Treatment
34227997	Evaluating Epidemiological Risk by Using Open Contact Tracing Data: Correlational Study. BACKGROUND: During the 2020s, there has been extensive debate about the possibility of using contact tracing (CT) to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and concerns have been raised about data security and privacy. Little has been said about the effectiveness of CT. In this paper, we present a real data analysis of a CT experiment that was conducted in Italy for 8 months and involved more than 100,000 CT app users. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to discuss the technical and health aspects of using a centralized approach. We also aimed to show the correlation between the acquired contact data and the number of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Finally, we aimed to analyze CT data to define population behaviors and show the potential applications of real CT data. METHODS: We collected, analyzed, and evaluated CT data on the duration, persistence, and frequency of contacts over several months of observation. A statistical test was conducted to determine whether there was a correlation between indices of behavior that were calculated from the data and the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population (new SARS-CoV-2-positive cases). RESULTS: We found evidence of a correlation between a weighted measure of contacts and the number of new SARS-CoV-2-positive cases (Pearson coefficient=0.86), thereby paving the road to better and more accurate data analyses and spread predictions. CONCLUSIONS: Our data have been used to determine the most relevant epidemiological parameters and can be used to develop an agent-based system for simulating the effects of restrictions and vaccinations. Further, we demonstrated our system's ability to identify the physical locations where the probability of infection is the highest. All the data we collected are available to the scientific community for further analysis.	Prevention
34339964	Drug interaction profile of TKI alectinib allows effective and safe treatment of ALK+ lung cancer in the kidney transplant recipient. ALK targeting with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a highly potent treatment option for the therapy of ALK positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, pharmacokinetics of TKIs leads to clinically significant drug interactions, and the interfering co-medication may hamper the anti-cancer therapeutic management. Here, we present for the first time a drug interaction profile of ALK-TKIs, crizotinib and alectinib, and immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine A in kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with ALK+ lung cancer. Based on therapeutic drug monitoring of cyclosporin A plasma level, the dose of cyclosporine A has been adjusted to achieve a safe and effective therapeutic level in terms of both cancer treatment and kidney transplant condition. Particularly, 15 years upon the kidney transplantation, the stage IV lung cancer patient was treated with the 1st-line chemotherapy, the 2nd-line ALK-TKI crizotinib followed by ALK-TKI alectinib. The successful therapy with ALK-TKIs has been continuing for more than 36 months, including the period when the patient was treated for COVID-19 bilateral pneumonia. Hence, the therapy of ALK+ NSCLC with ALK-TKIs in organ transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine A may be feasible and effective.	Treatment
34216468	Epidemiologic, immunologic, and virus characteristics in patients with paired SARS-CoV-2 serology and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. BACKGROUND: The natural history and clinical progression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections can be better understood using combined serological and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were collected at a single time-point from patients at an urban, public hospital August - November 2020 and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR, viral culture, and anti-Spike pan-Ig antibody testing. Participant demographics and symptoms were collected through interview. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to identify associations between RT-PCR and serology results with presence of viable virus and frequency of symptoms. RESULTS: Among 592 participants, 129 (21.8%) had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR or serology. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was strongly associated with lack of viable virus (p-value=0.016). COVID-19 symptom frequency was similar for patients testing RT-PCR positive/seronegative and patients testing RT-PCR positive/seropositive. Patients testing RT-PCR positive/seronegative reported headaches, fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting at rates not statistically significantly different from those testing RT-PCR negative/seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: While patients testing SARS-CoV-2 seropositive were unlikely to test positive for viable virus and were therefore low-risk for forward transmission, COVID-19 symptoms were common. Paired SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and antibody testing provides more nuanced understanding of patients' COVID-19 status.	Diagnosis;Transmission
34208435	Statins in COVID-19 Therapy. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3methylgultaryl-coenzyme A reductase (statins) are one of the main groups of drugs used in preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases worldwide. They are widely available, cheap, and well-tolerated. Based on statins' pleiotropic properties, including improvement of endothelial dysfunction, antioxidant properties, atherosclerotic plaque stabilization, and inhibition of inflammatory responses, it can be hypothesized that the use of statins, at least as an adjuvant in antiviral therapy, may be justified. All these effects might be especially beneficial in patients with COVID-19, suffering from endothelial dysfunction, microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis, and cytokine storm. Here, we review the recent data regarding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 activity in host cells, proposed COVID-19 therapy, the pleiotropic activity of statins, and statins in clinical trials in respiratory infections. According to the guidelines of the European and American Cardiac Societies, in patients with cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk with concomitant COVID-19 it is recommended to continue statin treatment. However, the initiation of statin therapy de novo in COVID-19 treatment should only be done as part of a clinical trial.	Mechanism;Treatment
34211276	Virtual Handover of Patients in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit During the Covid-19 Crisis. Objective: A key measure to mitigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been social distancing. Incorporating video-conferencing applications in the patient handover process between healthcare workers can enhance social distancing while maintaining handover elements. This study describes pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) physicians' experience using an online video-conferencing application for handover during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Qualitative content analysis. Setting: PICU at a university hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Subjects: PICU Physicians. Interventions: Due to the pandemic, the hospital's PICU used Zoom((R)) as a remote conferencing application instead of a face-to-face handover. Following institutional review board approval, data were collected over two weeks (1 Jul 2020 to 14 Jul 2020). Measurements: An online survey was conducted using open-ended questions to capture demographic data and the perceived efficacy of remote handovers. Thematic framework analysis process included open coding, creating categories, and abstraction. Main Results: All 37 PICU physicians who participated in the handover completed the survey. The participants comprised six attendings, nine specialists, and 22 residents. While 20 (54.1%) physicians reported attending 1-5 Zoom handovers by the time of the study, some (n. 6, 16.2%) had more than ten virtual handovers. They had variable previous teleconferencing experiences. Most physicians (78.4%) were comfortable conducting a remote handover. Most found that Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation handover elements were properly achieved through this remote handover process. The perceived advantages of online handover included fewer interruptions, time efficiency, and facilitation of social distancing. The perceived disadvantages were the paucity of nonverbal communication and teaching during virtual meetings. Conclusion: Video-conferencing applications for online handovers could supplement traditional face-to-face intensive care unit patient handover during outbreaks of infectious diseases. The use of video streaming and more emphasis on teaching should be encouraged to optimize the users' experience.	Prevention
34282223	Association between heavy metals, high-sensitivity C-reaction protein and 10-year risk of cardiovascular diseases among adult Korean population. The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in Korea tends to be increasing. It has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing evidence shows heavy metals are associated with increased CVD risk. We aimed to determine the association between the serum heavy metal levels and 10-year risk of CVDs and to predict risks of CVDs based on marginal effects. Heavy metals were measured by a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and direct mercury analyzer. The results show a significant relationship between the increase in cadmium, lead, mercury, hs-CRP levels and the 10-year risk of CVD after adjustment for serum cotinine, age group, sex, body mass index, a family history of CVDs, diabetes or hyperlipidemia, high-risk drinking, physical activity, and diabetes. A doubling of serum cadmium, lead, mercury, and hs-CRP was associated with the increase in the 10-year risk of CVD by 0.14%, 0.10%, 0.11% and 0.22%, respectively. Therefore, a special concern should be given to the harmful impacts of heavy metals on the 10-year risk of CVD. It is important to develop a prevention strategy targeting the high-risk population to slow down this progression to risk factors related to heavy metals and reduce prevalence. Remarkedly, hs-CRP is the most validated and widely used inflammatory marker, and could be a potential clinical value in predicting and monitoring CVDs.	Prevention
34226844	Trust in experts, not trust in national leadership, leads to greater uptake of recommended actions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that people vary in their desire to undertake protective actions during a health emergency, and that trust in authorities may influence decision making. We sought to examine how the trust in health experts and trust in White House leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic impacts individuals' decisions to adopt recommended protective actions such as mask-wearing. A mediation analysis was conducted using cross-sectional U.S. survey data collected between March 27 and 30, 2020, to elucidate how individuals' trust in health experts and White House leadership, their perceptions of susceptibility and severity to COVID-19, and perceived benefits of protecting against COVID-19, influenced their uptake of recommended protective actions. Trust in health experts was associated with greater perceived severity of COVID-19 and benefits of taking action, which led to greater uptake of recommended actions. Trust in White House leadership was associated with lower perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 and was not associated with taking recommended actions. Having trust in health experts is a greater predictor of individuals' uptake of protective actions than having trust in White House leadership. Public health messaging should emphasize the severity of COVID-19 and the benefits of protecting oneself while ensuring consistency and transparency to regain trust in health experts.	Prevention
34130811	Considerations for resuming global surgery outreach programs during and after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has disrupted the delivery of safe surgical care worldwide. One specific aspect of global surgical care that has been severely limited is the ability for physicians and trainees to participate in global surgical outreach programs in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: A narrative review of the literature regarding global surgical outreach programs during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic was performed. Factors that must be considered in the reinstatement of global surgical outreach programs were identified, and suggestions to address them were provided based on the available literature and the experiences of the senior authors. RESULTS: As global surgical outreach programs were canceled at the start of the pandemic, many academic surgeons turned to digital solutions to continue to engage with low- and middle-income country partners. With the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines and improved access to testing and treatment worldwide, the recommencement of global surgical outreach programs may begin to be considered. Important considerations before initiation include vaccine and testing availability for visiting providers, local staff, and patients, local hospital capacity, staff and equipment shortages, and the characteristics of the patient population and visiting providers. Region- and country-specific factors, including local infection rates and concomitant health crises, must also be taken into account. Expansion of digital collaborative efforts may further deepen international connections and promote sustainable models of care. CONCLUSION: With careful consideration, global surgical outreach programs may begin to be safely restarted in the near future. The current article evaluates individual factors that must be considered to safely restart global surgical outreach programs as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is better controlled.	Prevention
34226853	How are healthcare provider systems preparing for health emergency situations? Natural disasters, disease outbreaks, famine, and human conflict have strained communities everywhere over the course of human existence. However, modern changes in climate, human mobility, and other factors have increased the global community's vulnerability to widespread emergencies. We are in the midst of a disruptive health event, with the COVID-19 pandemic testing our health provider systems globally. This study presents a qualitative analysis of published literature, obtained systematically, to examine approaches health providers are taking to prepare for and respond to mass casualty incidents around the globe. The research reveals emerging trends in the weaknesses of systems' disaster responses while highlighting proposed solutions, so that others may better prepare for future disasters. Additionally, the research examines gaps in the literature, to foster more targeted and actionable contributions to the literature.	Prevention
34333701	Delays in thrombolysis during COVID-19 are associated with worse neurological outcomes: the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology Multicenter Collaboration. INTRODUCTION: We have demonstrated in a multicenter cohort that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a delay in intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) among stroke patients. Whether this delay contributes to meaningful short-term outcome differences in these patients warranted further exploration. METHODS: We conducted a nested observational cohort study of adult acute ischemic stroke patients receiving IVT from 9 comprehensive stroke centers across 7 U.S states. Patients admitted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (1/1/2019-02/29/2020) were compared to patients admitted during the early pandemic (3/1/2020-7/31/2020). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of IVT delay on discharge to hospice or death, with treatment delay on admission during COVID-19 included as an interaction term. RESULTS: Of the 676 thrombolysed patients, the median age was 70 (IQR 58-81) years, 313 were female (46.3%), and the median NIHSS was 8 (IQR 4-16). Longer treatment delays were observed during COVID-19 (median 46 vs 38 min, p = 0.01) and were associated with higher in-hospital death/hospice discharge irrespective of admission period (OR per hour 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.17, p = 0.03). This effect was strengthened after multivariable adjustment (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07-1.24, p < 0.001). There was no interaction of treatment delay on admission during COVID-19 (pinteraction = 0.65). Every one-hour delay in IVT was also associated with 7% lower odds of being discharged to home or acute inpatient rehabilitation facility (aOR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Treatment delays observed during the COVID-19 pandemic led to greater early mortality and hospice care, with a lower probability of discharge to home/rehabilitation facility. There was no effect modification of treatment delay on admission during the pandemic, indicating that treatment delay at any time contributes similarly to these short-term outcomes.	Prevention
34200502	The New Status of Parasitic Diseases in the COVID-19 Pandemic-Risk Factors or Protective Agents? It is possible that parasites may influence the course of COVID-19 infection, as either risk factors or protective agents; as such, the current coronavirus pandemic may affect the diagnosis and prevention of parasitic disease, and its elimination programs. The present review highlights the similarity between the symptoms of human parasitoses and those of COVID-19 and discuss their mutual influence. The study evaluated selected human parasitoses with similar symptoms to COVID-19 and examined their potential influence on SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion. The available data suggest that at least several human parasitoses could result in misdiagnosis of COVID-19. Some disorders, such as malaria, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths, can increase the risk of severe infection with COVID-19. It is also suggested that recovery from parasitic disease can enhance the immune system and protect from COVID-19 infection. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected parasitic disease elimination programs in endemic regions and influenced the number of diagnoses of human parasitoses.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
34202464	Genomic Association vs. Serological Determination of ABO Blood Types in a Chinese Cohort, with Application in Mendelian Randomization. ABO blood system is an inborn trait determined by the ABO gene. The genetic-phenotypic mechanism underneath the four mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive types of O, A, B and AB could theoretically be elucidated. However, genetic polymorphisms in the human populations render the link elusive, and importantly, past studies using genetically determined rather than biochemically determined ABO types were not and could not be evaluated for the inference errors. Upon both blood-typing and genotyping a cohort of 1008 people of the Han Chinese population, we conducted a genome-wide association study in parallel with both binomial and multinomial log-linear models. Significant genetic variants are all mapped to the ABO gene, and are quantitatively evaluated for binary and multi-class classification performances. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms of rs8176719, rs635634 and rs7030248 would together be sufficient to establish a multinomial predictive model that achieves high accuracy (0.98) and F1 scores (micro 0.99 and macro 0.97). Using the set of identified ABO-associated genetic variants as instrumental variables, we demonstrate the application in causal analysis by Mendelian randomization (MR) studies on blood pressures (one-sample MR) and severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure (two-sample MR).

34287482	Detection of coronavirus-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in conjunctival swabs from patients with severe form of Coronavirus disease 2019 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. OBJECTIVES: To test conjunctival swabs from patients with laboratory-confirmed severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). METHODS: Fifty conjunctival swabs were collected from 50 in-patients with laboratory-confirmed severe forms of COVID-19 at the largest teaching hospital and referral center in Brazil (HCFMUSP, Sao Paulo, SP). The samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 on rRT-PCR with the primers and probes described in the CDC protocol which amplify the region of the nucleocapsid N gene (2019_nCoV_N1 and 2019_nCoV_N2) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and compared with naso/oropharyngeal swabs collected within 24 hours of the conjunctival swabs. RESULTS: Five conjunctival samples (10%) tested positive (amplification of the N1 and N2 primer/probe sets) while two conjunctival samples (4%) yielded inconclusive results (amplification of the N1 primer/probe set only). The naso/oropharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on rRT-PCR in 34 patients (68%), negative in 14 (28%) and inconclusive in 2 (4%). The 5 patients with positive conjunctival swabs had positive (n=2), negative (n=2) or inconclusive (n=1) naso/oropharyngeal swabs on rRT-PCR. Patients with negative or inconclusive naso/oropharyngeal swabs had the diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by previous positive rRT-PCR results or by serology. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to present conjunctival swab rRT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in a Brazilian population. In our sample of 50 patients with severe forms of COVID-19, 10% had positive conjunctival swabs, most of which were correlated with positive naso/oropharyngeal rRT-PCR results.	Diagnosis
34205751	Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in the Vaginal Secretions of Women with COVID-19: A Prospective Study. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the likelihood of vaginal colonization with Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in pregnant and non-pregnant women with Coronavrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vaginal swabs were taken from women diagnosed with mild to moderately acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, at Wolfson Medical Center, Israel, from March 2020 through October 2020. COVID-19 was diagnosed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on nasopharyngeal swabs. Vaginal swabs were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In total, 51 women diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. Of the 51 women with COVID-19 enrolled in this study, 16 (31.4%) were pregnant at enrollment and 35 (68.6%) were non-pregnant. Mean age was 43.5 +/- 15.3 years (range 21-74 years). Compared to the non-pregnant group, the pregnant group was characterized by a higher white blood cell and absolute neutrophil count (p = 0.02 and p = 0.027, respectively). The non-pregnant patients were more likely to have chronic diseases (p = 0.035) and to be hospitalized (p < 0.001). Only one patient (1.9%) aged 60 years tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal secretions. Mean gestational age at the diagnosis of COVID-19 of the pregnant group was 32.3 +/- 7.8 weeks. Thirteen patients delivered during the study period; all delivered at term without obstetric complications and all neonates were healthy. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the vaginal secretions of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is rare. Vaginal colonization may occur during the viremia phase of the disease, although infectivity from vaginal colonization needs to be proven.	Diagnosis;Transmission
34209792	Disability among Older People: Analysis of Data from Disability Surveys in Six Low- and Middle-Income Countries. This analysis of surveys from six low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) aimed to (i) estimate the prevalence of disability among older adults and (ii) compare experiences and participation in key life areas among older people with and without disabilities which may show vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analysed from district-level or national surveys in Cameroon, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Nepal and the Maldives, which across the six databases totalled 3499 participants aged 60 years and above including 691 people with disabilities. Disability was common among adults 60+, ranging from 9.7% (8.0-11.8) in Nepal to 39.2% in India (95% CI 34.1-44.5%). Mobility was the most commonly reported functional difficulty. In each setting, older people with disabilities were significantly less likely to be working and reported greater participation restrictions and environmental barriers in key life areas compared to people in the same age categories without disabilities (p < 0.05). Disability is common in this population, and older people with disabilities may have greater difficulties participating in COVID-19 responses and have high economic vulnerabilities. It is imperative to prioritise the needs of older people with disabilities in the COVID-19 pandemic, including ensuring accessibility of both health services and the community in general.	Prevention
34228600	Bilateral post fever retinitis with retinal vascular occlusions following severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV2) infection. Introduction: As the world fights the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), several reports of retinal manifestations of the disease are emerging. Post fever retinitis is a well reported ocular inflammatory reaction to multiple invasive agents, be it virus, bacteria or other microbial agent.Purpose: We report an interesting case of bilateral multifocal retinitis with multiple vascular occlusions in a patient, three weeks after a febrile illness.Results: Investigations to ascertain the cause of fever resulted in identifying ephemeral seropositivity for several different Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. The retinitis was managed with systemic steroids, doxycycline and anticoagulants with improvement in vision.Conclusion: High and persistent seropositive response against (SARS-CoV-2) helped us to narrow it as the causative agent but the cross reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with other viruses can be misleading and needs careful interpretation.

34288921	Molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Cyprus. Whole genome sequencing of viral specimens following molecular diagnosis is a powerful analytical tool of molecular epidemiology that can critically assist in resolving chains of transmission, identifying of new variants or assessing pathogen evolution and allows a real-time view into the dynamics of a pandemic. In Cyprus, the first two cases of COVID-19 were identified on March 9, 2020 and since then 33,567 confirmed cases and 230 deaths were documented. In this study, viral whole genome sequencing was performed on 133 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected between March 2020 and January 2021. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to evaluate the genomic diversity of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. 15 different lineages were identified that clustered into three groups associated with the spring, summer and autumn/winter wave of SARS-CoV-2 incidence in Cyprus, respectively. The majority of the Cypriot samples belonged to the B.1.258 lineage first detected in September that spread rapidly and largely dominated the autumn/winter wave with a peak prevalence of 86% during the months of November and December. The B.1.1.7 UK variant (VOC-202012/01) was identified for the first time at the end of December and spread rapidly reaching 37% prevalence within one month. Overall, we describe the changing pattern of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus since the beginning of the pandemic until the end of January 2021. These findings highlight the role of importation of new variants through travel towards the emergence of successive waves of incidence in Cyprus and demonstrate the importance of genomic surveillance in determining viral genetic diversity and the timely identification of new variants for guiding public health intervention measures.

34364306	Successful control of COVID-19 outbreak through tracing, testing, and isolation: Lessons learned from the outbreak control efforts made in a metropolitan city of South Korea. The first surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases began on June 27, 2020 in Gwangju metropolitan city, located in the southwestern part of South Korea, with a population of 1,501,000. Local governments and the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention immediately started an epidemiologic investigation and traced the contacts of patients using a wide variety of data sources, including location data from mobile devices, credit card transaction, and closed-circuit television footage. Until July 16, 2020, 138 community transmission cases and 10 infection clusters were identified across the city. Through contact tracing, epidemiologic relatedness was found in 136 (98.6%) of 138 cases. Our investigation showed how the extensive and meticulous contact tracing suppressed COVID-19 outbreak in a populated city.	Prevention
34226881	Use of local perforator flaps for closure of a thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined twin defect after separation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Introduction: Conjoined twins are a rare medical phenomenon that poses unique challenges for surgeons. Separation of conjoined twins involves multidisciplinary teamwork, complex medical management and surgical planning, and multi-stage operations and often still has a high mortality and morbidity rate. In the times of the COVID-19 pandemic, separation of conjoined twins pose even greater challenges. Aiming for the best outcome possible, while minimizing the risk of COVID transmission and ensuring the safety of the personnel, is paramount. This case report presents thoraco-omphalopagus twins who were successfully separated at 4 months of age. The preoperative planning, operative details, postoperative follow-ups, and outcomes are discussed. Methods: The absence of a tissue expander and the inability to acquire it due to travel restrictions from COVID-19 further complicated the management on this patient. A Routine Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) swab test was performed on the patients and personnel. Standardized personnel protective equipment (PPE) was worn during ward and surgical care. After separation of the twins by cardiothoracic and pediatric surgeons, one twin underwent immediate skin closure using a double keystone perforator island flap and a lower abdominal perforator flap. Due to extensive defects, closure was delayed for the second twin. After a series of dressing changes, eventually local perforator flaps could be raised to close the defect using staged tension sutures and skin grafts for secondary defects. Results: Both twins were discharged with no significant morbidity, and no personnel were exposed to COVID-19 infection during the management. Conclusion: Preoperative coordination and planning, multidisciplinary effort, adherence to screening protocols for COVID, and strict use of standardized PPE all contributed to the successful separation of thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined twins during the COVID-19 pandemic.

34199852	Long-Term Persistence of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in a Pediatric Population. BACKGROUND: Antibody dynamics over time after SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unclear, and data regarding children are scarce. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed including children infected by SARS-CoV-2 between March and May 2020. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: children admitted with COVID-19; outpatient children with mild COVID-19; and seropositive children participating in a seroprevalence study among cohabitants of infected healthcare workers (HCWs). Six months after the infection, a new serological control was performed. RESULTS: A total of 58 children were included, 50% male (median age 8.3 [IQR 2.8-13.5] years). The median time between the two serological studies was 186 (IQR 176-192) days, and 86% (48/56) of the children maintained positive IgG six months after the infection. This percentage was 100% in admitted patients and 78% among the rest of the included children (p = 0.022). The diagnoses of lower respiratory tract infection and multisystemic inflammatory syndrome were associated with persistence of IgG (p = 0.035). The children of HCWs in the seroprevalence study lost antibodies more often (p = 0.017). Initial IgG titers of the children who remained positive six months after the infection were significantly higher (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Most children infected by SARS-CoV-2 maintain a positive serological response six months after the infection. Those children who lost their IgG titer were more frequently asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, presenting with low antibody titers after the infection.	Diagnosis
34206426	Chronic Back Condition and the Level of Physical Activity as Well as Internet Addiction among Physiotherapy Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Poland. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess back pain and its relation to physical activity as well as Internet addiction among Polish university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The research was conducted via the Internet in student groups of three universities in Poland (141 people). Back pain was examined by ODI-The Oswestry Disability Index and NDI-Neck Disability Index. The Polish-language International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to assess physical activity and the level of Internet addiction was tested using the Kimberly Young Questionnaire. Results: The respondents mostly suffered from pain originating in the cervical spine. In the study group, only every fifth person had a high level of physical activity. Sex differentiates the level of the measures considered. Sitting in front of the computer affects the pain in the spine. Conclusions: Research results suggest that the pandemic is negatively affecting students. Frequent occurrence of back pain is observed with a simultaneous low level of physical activity. Maintaining regular activity during a pandemic, at least at home, is an indispensable preventive measure for physical health.	Prevention
34367893	A highly potent and stable pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor as a candidate prophylactic and therapeutic for COVID-19 and other coronavirus diseases. The development of broad-spectrum antivirals against human coronaviruses (HCoVs) is critical to combat the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants, as well as future outbreaks of emerging CoVs. We have previously identified a polyethylene glycol-conjugated (PEGylated) lipopeptide, EK1C4, with potent pan-CoV fusion inhibitory activity. However, PEG linkers in peptide or protein drugs may reduce stability or induce anti-PEG antibodies in vivo. Therefore, we herein report the design and synthesis of a series of dePEGylated lipopeptide-based pan-CoV fusion inhibitors featuring the replacement of the PEG linker with amino acids in the heptad repeat 2 C-terminal fragment (HR2-CF) of HCoV-OC43. Among these lipopeptides, EKL1C showed the most potent inhibitory activity against infection by SARS-CoV-2 and its spike (S) mutants, as well as other HCoVs and some bat SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) tested. The dePEGylated lipopeptide EKL1C exhibited significantly stronger resistance to proteolytic enzymes, better metabolic stability in mouse serum, higher thermostability than the PEGylated lipopeptide EK1C4, suggesting that EKL1C could be further developed as a candidate prophylactic and therapeutic for COVID-19 and other coronavirus diseases.

34356547	Impact of Covid-19 on the Visit of Pediatric Patients with Injuries to the Emergency Department in Korea. The total number of pediatric emergency department (PED) visitors has decreased worldwide since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. We hypothesized that this might also affect the number of PED visits due to injuries. Therefore, we investigated these changes in PED visits after the COVID-19 outbreak through a long-term multicenter observational study. We assessed the changes in the proportion of injured pediatric patients' weekly visits and the trend in the rate changes since the COVID-19 epidemic began by segmented regression analysis. We also evaluated the weekly change in the distribution of detailed diagnostic codes among pediatric patients with injuries before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion of injury-related PED visits increased when COVID-19 was first confirmed in Korea. After the COVID-19 epidemic, the proportion of foreign body ingestions and fracture patients among all pediatric patients with injuries increased significantly every week. The changes in the proportion of injured pediatric patients after the COVID-19 outbreak may have been the result of social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. The risk of pediatric infections decreased but the risk of injury remained. Therefore, parents should take precautions to prevent infectious diseases and be careful to prevent children's injuries at home.	Prevention
34367509	Abdominal imaging in COVID-19. Initially thought of as a respiratory infection, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is now recognized as a complex disease with a wide clinical spectrum, including digestive involvement. While several studies have evaluated chest imaging findings in COVID-19, few papers have looked at the abdominal imaging features of these patients. Liver, biliary, pancreas and bowel involvement have been reported in COVID-19 infected patients. In this review, we aim to summarize currently available data related to abdominal imaging techniques in COVID-19, in accordance with relevant clinical and laboratory workup of these patients. Underlying mechanisms, indications and imaging findings related to COVID-19 are discussed based on published data. Also, practice points for clinicians are highlighted in order to adequately recognize digestive-related injuries of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. While there's been a steady accumulation of data with respect to abdominal imaging findings in COVID-19, currently available recommendations are based on limited research. There is a wide spectrum of abdominal imaging findings in COVID-19, which includes hepato-biliary, pancreatic and luminal pathology.	Diagnosis
34215924	"Clinical variants of myocardial involvement in COVID-19-positive patients: a cumulative experience of 2020. Myocardial injury, diagnosed by troponin elevation, is common in COVID-19 patients, but cardiac involvement with clinical manifestations occurs less frequently. We analyzed the literature on COVID-19 (2020) and systematically reviewed the cases where individual patient data were presented. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for ""COVID,"" ""COVID-19,"" and ""coronavirus"" in combination with ""myocarditis,"" ""heart failure,"" ""takotsubo,"" ""cardiomyopathy,"" and ""cardiogenic shock."" We identified 90 cases of COVID-19 with myocardial involvement, mean age 52.9 +/- 18.3 years, 54.5% males. Of them, 55 survived (61.1%), 20 died (22.2%), and in 15 (16.7%) the outcome was unknown at the time of publication. Among patients with known outcome, mortality was 26%. The nadir LVEF was 31.7 +/- 13.1% and recovered to 50.1 +/- 16.0%. Pericardial effusion was a common finding, reported in 21 (23.3%) of patients, including moderate size effusion in 8.9% and large in 7.8%. The effusion caused tamponade in 11 (12.2%) of patients. Out of 83 patients who experienced a decrease in LVEF, 30 could be classified as takotsubo syndrome. The takotsubo patients were older than those with myocarditis, and with relatively high proportion of males. About one third of the cases was complicated by cardiogenic shock. Myocardial involvement in COVID-19 patients most often presents as a new, rapid decrease in LVEF, although normal LVEF or takotsubo-like wall motion pattern does not rule out myocarditis. Moderate and large pericardial effusion is common, and cardiac tamponade occurs in 12.2% of patients. Cardiogenic shock develops in one third of the patients. Mortality appears to be high at 26%."

34291812	"Interventions for the prevention of persistent post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction. BACKGROUND: Loss of olfactory function is well recognised as a cardinal symptom of COVID-19 infection, and the ongoing pandemic has resulted in a large number of affected individuals with abnormalities in their sense of smell. For many, the condition is temporary and resolves within two to four weeks. However, in a significant minority the symptoms persist. At present, it is not known whether early intervention with any form of treatment (such as medication or olfactory training) can promote recovery and prevent persisting olfactory disturbance. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions that have been used, or proposed, to prevent persisting olfactory dysfunction due to COVID-19 infection. A secondary objective is to keep the evidence up-to-date, using a living systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register; Cochrane ENT Register; CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished studies. The date of the search was 16 December 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials including participants who had symptoms of olfactory disturbance following COVID-19 infection. Individuals who had symptoms for less than four weeks were included in this review. Studies compared any intervention with no treatment or placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were the presence of normal olfactory function, serious adverse effects and change in sense of smell. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of parosmia, change in sense of taste, disease-related quality of life and other adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included one study of 100 participants, which compared an intranasal steroid spray to no intervention. Participants in both groups were also advised to undertake olfactory training for the duration of the trial. Data were identified for only two of the prespecified outcomes for this review, and no data were available for the primary outcome of serious adverse effects. Intranasal corticosteroids compared to no intervention (all using olfactory training) Presence of normal olfactory function after three weeks of treatment was self-assessed by the participants, using a visual analogue scale (range 0 to 10, higher scores = better). A score of 10 represented ""completely normal smell sensation"". The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of intranasal corticosteroids on self-rated recovery of sense of smell (estimated absolute effect 619 per 1000 compared to 520 per 1000, risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.68; 1 study; 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Change in sense of smell was not reported, but the self-rated score for sense of smell was reported at the endpoint of the study with the same visual analogue scale (after three weeks of treatment). The median scores at endpoint were 10 (interquartile range (IQR) 9 to 10) for the group receiving intranasal corticosteroids, and 10 (IQR 5 to 10) for the group receiving no intervention (1 study; 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very limited evidence regarding the efficacy of different interventions at preventing persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID-19 infection. However, we have identified a small number of additional ongoing studies in this area. As this is a living systematic review, the evidence will be updated regularly to incorporate new data from these, and other relevant studies, as they become available. For this (first) version of the living review, we identified a single study of intranasal corticosteroids to include in this review, which provided data for only two of our prespecified outcomes. The evidence was of very low certainty, therefore we were unable to determine whether intranasal corticosteroids may have a beneficial or harmful effect."	Treatment
34217771	Is diabetes mellitus a wrongdoer to COVID-19 severity? The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has turned out to be a pandemic in short period of time due to the high transmissibility of its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Various reports have suggested the promising link between overexpression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and COVID-19 pathogenesis. The severity of COVID-19 pathophysiology is greatly depended on several comorbidities, like hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), respiratory and cardiovascular disease, out of which DM has emerged as a major risk factor. The current review focuses on the link among the expression of ACE2, use of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), and risk of COVID-19 pathogenesis in DM. The review also emphasizes on synergistic detrimental effect of DM and COVID-19 on the immune system in provoking uncontrolled cytokine storm which eventually leads to lethal consequences. Finally, several possible therapeutic strategies have been highlighted to reduce the excess of risk associated with COVID-19 in people with DM.	Mechanism;Treatment
34131028	Changes in family medicine visits across sociodemographic groups after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario: a retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened socioeconomic disparities in access to primary care. Given these concerns, we investigated whether the pandemic affected visits to family physicians differently across sociodemographic groups. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records from family physician practices within the University of Toronto Practice-Based Research Network. We evaluated primary care visits for a fixed cohort of patients who were active within the database as of Jan. 1, 2019, to estimate the number of patients who visited their family physician (visitor rate) and the number of distinct visits (visit volume) between Jan. 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. We compared trends in visitor rate and visit volume during the pandemic (Mar. 14 to June 30, 2020) with the same period in the previous year (Mar. 14 to June 30, 2019) across sociodemographic factors, including age, sex, neighbourhood income, material deprivation and ethnic concentration. RESULTS: We included 365 family physicians and 372 272 patients. Compared with the previous year, visitor rates during the pandemic period dropped by 34.5%, from 357 visitors per 1000 people to 292 visitors per 1000 people. Declines in visit volume during the pandemic were less pronounced (21.8% fewer visits), as the mean number of visits per patient increased during the pandemic (from 1.64 to 1.96). The declines in visitor rate and visit volume varied based on patient age and sex, but not socioeconomic status. INTERPRETATION: Although the number of visits to family physicians dropped substantially during the first few weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, patients from communities with low socioeconomic status did not appear to be disproportionately affected. In this primary care setting, the pandemic appears not to have worsened socioeconomic disparities in access to care.	Prevention
34363852	Mutation hotspots and spatiotemporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil, February 2020-2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has already reached more than 110 million people and is associated with 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Brazil is the third worst-hit country, with approximately 10.2 million cases and 250 thousand deaths. International efforts have been established to share information about Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemiology and evolution to support the development of effective strategies for public health and disease management. We aimed to analyze the high-quality genome sequences from Brazil from February 2020-2021 to identify mutation hotspots, geographical and temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages by using phylogenetics and phylodynamics analyses. We describe heterogeneous sequencing efforts, the progression of the different lineages along time, evaluating mutational spectra and frequency oscillations derived from the prevalence of specific lineages across different Brazilian regions. We found at least seven major (1-7) and two minor clades related to the six most prevalent lineages in the country and described its spatial distribution and dynamics. The emergence and recent frequency shift of lineages (P.1 and P.2) carrying mutations of concern in the spike protein (e. g., E484K, N501Y) draws attention due to their association with immune evasion and enhanced receptor binding affinity. Improvements in genomic surveillance are of paramount importance and should be extended in Brazil to better inform policy makers about better decisions to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.	Mechanism
34337734	Plasma convalescent decrease mortality in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of Convalescent Plasma (CP) in reducing mortality of COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted from PubMed, Embase, Medrxiv, and Google Scholar from April and finalized in December 2020 using the following terms: covid-19, convalescent plasma, cp, ccp, copla. The studies were screened, extracted, and evaluated by two authors independently. Comparative retrospective or prospective studies with a control group were included. Mortality was defined as the outcome of interest. Research articles not published in the English language, not available in full text, review articles, no measured outcome of interest were excluded from this study. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in this meta-analysis. There were 5658 patients with 2092 patients treated with CP and 3536 patients as a control group. Forest plot showed CP use was associated with decreased mortality with OR = 0.64 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.84, p<0.001) and heterogeneity (I2)= 27.62%. Few patients experienced an adverse event, but no fatal case was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Convalescent plasma is effective in reducing mortality of severe and critical COVID-19 with tolerable adverse effects.	Treatment;Diagnosis
34349570	Protective Boxes to Prevent Airborne Transmission of SARS-COV-2: Hospital-Based Experiences and a Narrative Literature Review. Objective: Occupational safety in healthcare settings is an integral part of treating COVID-19. A growing body of evidence suggests that the inhalation of both respiratory droplets (>5 microm) and tiny aerosols (<5 microm) is a possible route of virus transmission. Recently, innovative barrier enclosures (aerosol boxes) have been designed to cover patients' heads while allowing the implementation of airway management procedures through fitted holes. The initial design has undergone a series of modifications to improve staff safety, operators' ergonomics, and the efficacy of airway procedures. Methods: We reviewed the literature concerning different box modifications and provided an insight into our experience of using the box. Aerosol boxes have garnered the attention of clinicians who are frequently exposed to aerosols while performing aerosol-generating medical procedures, particularly endotracheal intubation. Current evidence comes from simulation-based studies rather than real-life clinical investigations. Results: The reports indicated that the box has significantly reduced the diffusion of aerosols into the room; however, the operators have experienced difficulties in the maneuverability of airway devices. Conclusion: Aerosol boxes should be used for patients necessitating simple elective intubations after healthcare providers are adequately trained. Customized designs can be further made based on clinicians' experiences.	Prevention;Transmission
34283343	Patient's point of view on the use of telemedicine in multiple sclerosis: a web-based survey. Restrictions in the access to healthcare facilities during COVID-19 pandemic have raised the need for remote monitoring of chronic medical conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS). In order to enable the continuity of care in these circumstances, many telemedicine applications are currently tested. While physicians' preferences are commonly investigated, data regarding the patients' point of view are still lacking. We built a 37 items web-based survey exploring patients' propensity, awareness, and opinions on telemedicine with the aim to evaluate the sustainability of this approach in MS. Analysing 613 questionnaires out of 1093 that were sent to persons with MS followed at the Multiple Sclerosis Center of Tor Vergata University, Rome, we found that more than half of respondents (54%) were open to having a televisit. Propensity toward telemedicine significantly depended on having a higher income (p = 0.037), living farther from the center (p = 0.038), using computer and tablet (p = 0.010) and using the Internet for other remote activities (p < 0.001), conversely it was not influenced by any specific disease characteristics (i.e. degree of disability). The main advantages and disadvantages of televisit reported by participants were respectively saving time (70%) and impossibility to measure physical parameters (71%). Although the majority of respondents are in favour of televisit, so far this approach is restricted to those displaying better socioeconomic conditions and higher familiarity with technology. Implications of the study are that telemedicine platforms should be better tailored to patients' demands in order to spread the use of telemedicine, to enhance usability and to increase patients' adherence.

34284531	One and a half years into the COVID-19 pandemic - Exit strategies and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for holistic management and achieving global control. The pandemic has now unfolded over the past one and a half year and all data show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher mortality compared to influenza and people with sequelae after infection need to be treated by the health care systems. Evolution of new virus variants is discussed. The global expansion of the delta variant demonstrates that new variants with a higher transmission potential and also being more pathogenic can easily arise. So far, the roll out of vaccines has been the most efficient tool to control the pandemic. With the evolution of new variants vaccine efficacy must be closely monitored. The zoonotic nature of the virus means that it can cross from humans into an animal reservoir and back again, and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 virus in animals in close contact to humans are needed. There will most certainly be a new wave in the coming year and it is possible that a booster vaccination is needed. To increase population immunity and reduce circulation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations most probably have to be expanded to children.	Treatment

34343708	Longitudinal observation of antibody responses for 14 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Better understanding of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 after natural infection might provide valuable insights into the future implementation of vaccination policies. Longitudinal analysis of IgG antibody titers was carried out in 32 recovered COVID-19 patients based in the Umbria region of Italy for 14 months after Mild and Moderately-Severe infection.Two FDA-approved immunoassays against SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein (NCP) and anti-spike-receptor binding domain (S-RBD) were used for sequential serological tests at different time points. The demographics,clinical history and symptom profile associated with the magnitude and longevity of antibody responses were also analyzed. Anti-S-RBD IgG persisted in 96.8% (31 of 32) subjects at 14 months. Patients reporting loss of smell and taste during the clinical course of the disease developed significantly higher antibody titers. Anti-NCP IgG seronegative patients(n=7) at 10 months, tested positive for anti-S-RBD IgG at 12,13 and 14 months emphasizing on a higher false-negative rate for NCP protein-based antibody assays. This study also highlights the importance of adopting specific immunoassays for routine estimation of antibody titers and the decreased rate of re-infections in recovered patients.	Diagnosis
34218701	Polio Supplementary Immunization Activities During COVID-19 Pandemic: Experience from Penampang District, Sabah, Malaysia. BACKGROUND: Polio Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) were carried out in the State of Sabah in response to the Vaccine Derived Poliovirus outbreak declared in December 2019. Prior to this, Malaysia had been polio-free over the past 27 years. This paper reported on the successful implementation of SIAs in the district of Penampang, Sabah, adapting (vaccine administration) to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A series of meticulous planning, healthcare staff training, advocacy, and community engagement activities were conducted by the Penampang District Health Office. Bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (bOPV) and monovalent Oral Polio Vaccine were administered over the period of 1 year via these methods: house to house, drive-through, static, and mobile posts. The targeted group was 22 096 children aged 13 years and below. RESULTS: Polio SIAs in Penampang managed to achieve more than 90% coverage for both bOPV and mOPV. The overall vaccine wastage was reported to be 1.63%. No major adverse reaction was reported. CONCLUSION: High vaccine uptake during Polio SIAs in Penampang was attributed to good inter-agency collaboration, community engagement, intensified health promotion activities, and drive-through vaccination campaign.

34225625	Diagnostic Performance Of Radiology Residents In Thoracic Ct Imaging In Emergency Radiology During The Covid-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the workload of all radiologists and radiology residents, as well as other clinical physicians, has increased. INTRODUCTION: This study aims to determine the diagnostic performance of radiology residents, who effectively contribute to the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: The thoracic computed tomography (CT) images of 135 patients aged 20-83 diagnosed with COVID-19 were evaluated retrospectively by five radiology residents and a radiologist with 10 years of experience. The diagnostic performance of the radiology residents in evaluating COVID-19 was assessed according to their year of residency and the patients' age and gender. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of radiology residents. RESULTS: The radiology residents' performance in determining COVID-19 using CT findings was evaluated as follows: sensitivity 97.22%, specificity 88.89%, positive predictive value 90.91%, negative predictive value 96.55%, and accuracy 93.33%. According to the year of residency, the sensitivity and specificity of the radiology residents in determining COVID-19 using CT images were between 92.3% and 100%, and 71.43% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity and specificity of radiology residents in evaluating thoracic CT images for COVID-19 diagnosis indicate that radiologists are as important as clinical physicians in the diagnosis of COVID-19.

34336202	Global burden of acute myocardial injury associated with COVID-19: A systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression. Background: The body of evidence showed that there is a strong correlation between acute myocardial Injury and COVID-19 infection. However, the link between acute myocardial infection and COVID-19, the prevalence, reliability of diagnostic modalities, independent predictors, and clinical outcomes are still uncertain and a topic of debate. The current study was designed to determine the prevalence, determinants, and outcomes of acute myocardial injury based on a systematic review and meta-analysis the global published peer-reviewed works of literature. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed/Medline; Science direct, CINHAL, and LILACS from December 2019 to May 2021. All observational studies reporting the prevalence of AMI were included while case reports and reviews were excluded. The data were extracted with two independent authors in a customized format. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa appraisal tool. Results: A total of 397 articles were identified from different databases. Thirty-seven Articles with 21, 204 participants were included while seven studies were excluded. The meta-analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of myocardial injury during the COVID-19 pandemic was 22.33 % (95 % CI: 17.86 to 26.81, 37). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis showed that mortality among patients with an acute myocardial injury during COVID-19 was more than four times more likely as compared to those without AMI. This necessitates a mitigating strategy to prevent and manage before its clinical outcomes getting worse.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34228369	Rhinovirus spread in children during the COVID-19 pandemic despite social restrictions-A nationwide register study in Finland. Social restrictions during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic strongly affected the epidemiology of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). As rhinovirus seemed to spread despite the restrictions, we aimed to analyze rhinovirus epidemiology in children during the pandemic. This register-based study used data from the Finnish Infectious Disease Register. Nationwide rhinovirus findings from July 2015 to March 2021 were included and stratified by age (0-4, 5-9, and 10-14). Cumulative 14-day incidence per 100000 children was calculated. Four thousand five hundred and seventy six positive rhinovirus findings were included, of which 3788 (82.8%) were among children aged 0-4. The highest recorded incidence was 36.2 among children aged 0-4 in October 2017. The highest recorded incidence during the pandemic period was 13.6 in November 2020. The impact of the restrictions was mostly seen among children aged 0-4 years of age in weeks 14-22 in 2020. The incidence has since remained near reference levels in all age groups. Strict restrictions temporarily interrupted the circulation of rhinovirus in spring 2020. Rhinovirus incidence returned to normal levels soon after the harsh restrictions were lifted. These looser social restrictions prevented RSV and influenza seasons but failed to prevent the spread of rhinovirus.	Prevention
34199214	Impact of Prophylactic Hydroxychloroquine on People at High Risk of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. There are no proven prophylactic interventions for COVID-19. We systematically reviewed the efficacy of prophylactic hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. Studies evaluating hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of COVID-19 were searched in several engines until 8 December 2020. Primary outcomes included RT-PCR positivity, COVID-19 infections (positive RT-PCR or compatible COVID-19 symptoms), and all-cause mortality. Random effects meta-analyses were performed for all outcomes. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 5579) and one cohort (n = 106) were included. Placebo was the comparator in four RCTs, and usual care in one RCT. Compared to the controls, five RCTs showed that hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis did not reduce RT-PCR positivity (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.88-1.16), COVID-19 infection (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78-1.22), or all-cause mortality (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.27-1.99). There were no differences of effects by pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis. Prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine increased the risk of diarrhea, abdominal pain, or vomiting (RR 4.56, 95% CI 1.58-13.19). There were no effects of hydroxychloroquine on other secondary outcomes. Quality of evidence was low to very low for all outcomes. Hydroxychloroquine was not efficacious as a prophylaxis for COVID-19 infections, defined either as RT-PCR positivity or as a composite of RT-PCR positivity or compatible symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine did not reduce all-cause mortality, clinical worsening, or adverse events.	Treatment
34292775	Outpatient Practice Reactivation in an Integrated Community Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted health care organizations throughout the world. The Southwest Minnesota Region of Mayo Clinic Health System, a community-based health care system, was not immune, and in March 2020, our outpatient services were deferred and decreased by 90%. Method: This article is a review of the approach we used to safely reactivate outpatient care, the tools that we developed, and the outcomes of these reactivation efforts. A novel Outpatient Practice Reactivation Framework was established and used that included Outpatient Clinic Appointment Dashboard, Decision Matrix, Access Management, Virtual Care, and Patient Safety. This framework was guided by patient demand for care and by safety principles, as recommended by state and federal agencies and our internal infectious disease department guidelines. Results and Conclusions: Over the course of 9 weeks, ambulatory visit volumes and clinic utilization rates returned to pre-COVID levels (Pre-COVID fill rate range: 87% to 94%, post-COVID fill rate range: 86% to 89%) exceeding target fill rate of 80%, as a result of establishing the initiative as a shared priority, committing to a robust schedule and decisive actions, creating and maintaining a well-defined structure, taking an inclusive approach, overcommunicating and providing sufficient data for transparency, developing guiding principles, and training and educating staff.

34293587	Ant colony optimization with Cauchy and greedy Levy mutations for multilevel COVID 19 X-ray image segmentation. This paper focuses on the study of multilevel COVID-19 X-ray image segmentation based on swarm intelligence optimization to improve the diagnostic level of COVID-19. We present a new ant colony optimization with the Cauchy mutation and the greedy Levy mutation, termed CLACO, for continuous domains. Specifically, the Cauchy mutation is applied to the end phase of ant foraging in CLACO to enhance its searchability and to boost its convergence rate. The greedy Levy mutation is applied to the optimal ant individuals to confer an improved ability to jump out of the local optimum. Furthermore, this paper develops a novel CLACO-based multilevel image segmentation method, termed CLACO-MIS. Using 2D Kapur's entropy as the CLACO fitness function based on 2D histograms consisting of non-local mean filtered images and grayscale images, CLACO-MIS was successfully applied to the segmentation of COVID-19 X-ray images. A comparison of CLACO with some relevant variants and other excellent peers on 30 benchmark functions from IEEE CEC2014 demonstrates the superior performance of CLACO in terms of search capability, and convergence speed as well as ability to jump out of the local optimum. Moreover, CLACO-MIS was shown to have a better segmentation effect and a stronger adaptability at different threshold levels than other methods in performing segmentation experiments of COVID-19 X-ray images. Therefore, CLACO-MIS has great potential to be used for improving the diagnostic level of COVID-19. This research will host a webservice for any question at https://aliasgharheidari.com.	Diagnosis
34225328	Evaluation of COVID-19-Associated Myocarditis Via Point-of-Care Ultrasound in a Pediatric Patient. ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated myocarditis has been reported from the onset of the pandemic. The presumed etiology is direct damage to the myocardium from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common findings include electrocardiogram abnormalities, elevated cardiac markers, and diminished cardiac function. This can lead to heart failure and cardiogenic shock with resultant poor perfusion. Thus, myocarditis has been recognized as a cause of death in patients with COVID-19. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict the prevalence of myocarditis in these patients given the relative novelty of the pandemic and the lack of available data. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been shown to be a useful modality to investigate lung pathology in patients with COVID-19. Bedside cardiac POCUS can also be used to investigate cardiac pathology. This case describes a pediatric patient with COVID-19 who had evidence of myocarditis on POCUS in the pediatric emergency department.	Case Report
34285686	Clinical and epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of Coronavirus disease-19 patients in a large longitudinal study. Objective: This study aimed to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 patients. Methods: In this large cohort study, 15,409 confirmed patients with the COVID-19 of different severities were followed-up from three specialized COVID-19 hospitals between March 18 and October 11, 2020 in Iraqi Kurdistan. The predictors of mortality and severity were examined in binary logistic regression analysis. Results: The incidence rate of severe/critical status was 12.3% with a median age of 36.0 and case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.98%. The incidence rate of severe/critical conditions and CFR rose with increased age groups; except for 0-14 years (11.9%). The incidence rate of severe/critical patients and CFR was 8.3% and 0.5%, 21.1% and 4.0%, and 23.7% and 8.7% in 15-49 years, 50-64 years, and 65 and older age groups, respectively. The severity of the disease and CFR was associated with coexisting chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (18.2% and 3.1%) and diabetes mellitus (19.8% and 3.4%). The asymptomatic patients (8400 and 54.5%) had statistically higher CFR; 2.3% versus 1.6% (P = 0.006). The most common symptoms on diagnosis were fever (31.9%), cough (23.5%), loss of smell/taste (16.3%), sore throat (15.7%), shortness of breath (9.8%), and headache (9.5%). The results showed that being older was the only predictor of mortality and severity in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: This region has a low incidence of severe-critic status and CFR. The patients with coexisting medical conditions are more likely to have severe conditions and die of COVID-19. The older age predicts severe/critic status and higher CFR.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34209720	Compromised Lung Volume and Hemostatic Abnormalities in COVID-19 Pneumonia: Results from an Observational Study on 510 Consecutive Patients. BACKGROUND: Hemostatic abnormalities have been described in COVID-19, and pulmonary microthrombosis was consistently found at autopsy with concomitant severe lung damage. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational cross-sectional study including consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent unenhanced chest CT upon admittance at the emergency room (ER) in one large academic hospital. QCT was used for the calculation of compromised lung volume (%CL). Clinical data were retrieved from patients' files. Laboratory data were obtained upon presentation at the ER. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between hemostatic abnormalities and lung involvement in patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia as described using computer-aided quantitative evaluation of chest CT (quantitative CT (QCT)). RESULTS: A total of 510 consecutive patients (68% males), aged 67 years in median, diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, who underwent unenhanced CT scan upon admission to the ER, were included. In all, 115 patients had %CL > 23%; compared to those with %CL < 23%, they showed higher levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen, and CRP, greater platelet count, and longer PT ratio. Via multivariate regression analysis, BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2), D-dimer levels > 500 ng/mL, CRP > 5.0 ng/mL and PT ratio > 1.2 were found to be independent predictors of a %CL > 23% (adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals): 2.1 (1.1-4.0), 3.1 (1.6-5.8), 2.4 (1.3-4.5), and 3.4 (1.4-8.5), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Hemostatic abnormalities in patients affected by COVID-19 correlate with the severity of lung injury as measured by %CL. Our results underline the pathogenetic role of hemostasis in COVID-19 pneumonia beyond the presence of clinically evident thromboembolic complications.	Diagnosis
34218997	How Should ECMO Be Used Under Conditions of Severe Scarcity? A Population Study of Public Perception. OBJECTIVE: To assess societal preferences regarding allocation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a rescue option for select patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample. SETTING: Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. PARTICIPANTS: In total, responses from 1,041 members of Amazon Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing platform were included. Participants were 37.9 +/- 12.6 years old, generally white (65%), and college-educated (66.1%). Many reported working in a healthcare setting (22.5%) and having a friend or family member who was admitted to the hospital (43.8%) or died from COVID-19 (29.9%). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Although most reported an unwillingness to stay on ECMO for >one week without signs of recovery, participants were highly supportive of ECMO utilization as a life-preserving technique on a policy level. The majority (96.7%) advocated for continued use of ECMO to treat COVID patients during periods of resource scarcity but would prioritize those with highest likelihood of recovery (50%) followed by those who were sickest regardless of survival chances (31.7%). Patients >40 years old were more likely to prefer distributing ECMO on a first-come first-served basis (21.5% v 13.3%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Even though participants expressed hesitation regarding ECMO in personal circumstances, they were uniformly in support of using ECMO to treat COVID patients at a policy level for others who might need it, even in the setting of severe scarcity.

34380191	Clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Sfax, Tunisia. Background: Africa, like the rest of the world, has been impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, only a few studies covering this subject in Africa have been published. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of critically ill adult COVID-19 patients-all of whom had a confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Habib Bourguiba University Hospital (Sfax, Tunisia). Results: A total of 96 patients were admitted into our ICU for respiratory distress due to COVID-19 infection. Mean age was 62.4+/-12.8 years and median age was 64 years. Mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 105+/-60 and </=300 in all cases but one. Oxygen support was required for all patients (100%) and invasive mechanical ventilation for 38 (40%). Prone positioning was applied in 37 patients (38.5%). Within the study period, 47 of the 96 patients died (49%). Multivariate analysis showed that the factors associated with poor outcome were the development of acute renal failure (odds ratio [OR], 6.7), the use of mechanical ventilation (OR, 5.8), and serum cholinesterase (SChE) activity lower than 5,000 UI/L (OR, 5.9). Conclusion: : In this retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients admitted to the ICU in Sfax, Tunisia, for acute respiratory failure following COVID-19 infection, the mortality rate was high. The development of acute renal failure, the use of mechanical ventilation, and SChE activity lower than 5000 UI/L were associated with a poor outcome.	Diagnosis;Treatment
33605016	Effectiveness, safety and acceptability of no-test medical abortion (termination of pregnancy) provided via telemedicine: a national cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes before and after implementation of medical abortion (termination of pregnancy) without ultrasound via telemedicine. DESIGN: Cohort analysis. SETTING: The three main abortion providers. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: Medical abortions at home at </=69 days' gestation in two cohorts: traditional model (in-person with ultrasound, n = 22 158) from January to March 2020 versus telemedicine-hybrid model (either in person or via telemedicine without ultrasound, n = 29 984, of whom 18 435 had no-test telemedicine) between April and June 2020. Sample (n = 52 142) comprises 85% of all medical abortions provided nationally. METHODS: Data from electronic records and incident databases were used to compare outcomes between cohorts, adjusted for baseline differences. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment success, serious adverse events, waiting times, gestation at treatment, acceptability. RESULTS: Mean waiting time from referral to treatment was 4.2 days shorter in the telemedicine-hybrid model and more abortions were provided at </=6 weeks' gestation (40% versus 25%, P < 0.001). Treatment success (98.8% versus 98.2%, P > 0.999), serious adverse events (0.02% versus 0.04%, P = 0.557) and incidence of ectopic pregnancy (0.2% versus 0.2%, P = 0.796) were not different between models. In the telemedicine-hybrid model, 0.04% were estimated to be over 10 weeks' gestation at the time of the abortion; all were completed safely at home. Within the telemedicine-hybrid model, effectiveness was higher with telemedicine than in-person care (99.2% versus 98.1%, P < 0.001). Acceptability of telemedicine was high (96% satisfied) and 80% reported a future preference for telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: A telemedicine-hybrid model for medical abortion that includes no-test telemedicine and treatment without an ultrasound is effective, safe, acceptable and improves access to care. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Compelling evidence from 52 142 women shows no-test telemedicine abortion is safe, effective and improves care.	Prevention
34198917	Pilot Study to Assess the Feasibility of a Mobile Unit for Remote Cognitive Screening of Isolated Elderly in Rural Areas. BACKGROUND: Given the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, now more than ever, remote solutions for assessing and monitoring individuals with cognitive impairment are urgently needed. Older adults in particular, living in isolated rural areas or so-called 'medical deserts', are facing major difficulties in getting access to diagnosis and care. Telemedical approaches to assessments are promising and seem well accepted, reducing the burden of bringing patients to specialized clinics. However, many older adults are not yet adequately equipped to allow for proper implementation of this technology. A potential solution could be a mobile unit in the form of a van, equipped with the telemedical system which comes to the patients' home. The aim of this proof-of-concept study is to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of such mobile unit settings for remote cognitive testing. Methods and analysis: eight participants (aged between 69 and 86 years old) from the city of Digne-Les-Bains volunteered for this study. A basic neuropsychological assessment, including a short clinical interview, is administered in two conditions, by telemedicine in a mobile clinic (equipped van) at a participants' home and face to face in a specialized clinic. The administration procedure order is randomized, and the results are compared with each other. Acceptability and user experience are assessed among participants and clinicians in a qualitative and quantitative manner. Measurements of stress indicators were collected for comparison. RESULTS: The analysis revealed no significant differences in test results between the two administration procedures. Participants were, overall, very satisfied with the mobile clinic experience and found the use of the telemedical system relatively easy. CONCLUSION: A mobile unit equipped with a telemedical service could represent a solution for remote cognitive testing overcoming barriers in rural areas to access specialized diagnosis and care.

34220861	Glycophosphopeptical AM3 Food Supplement: A Potential Adjuvant in the Treatment and Vaccination of SARS-CoV-2. The world is currently experiencing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its global spread has resulted in millions of confirmed infections and deaths. While the global pandemic continues to grow, the availability of drugs to treat COVID-19 infections remains limited to supportive treatments. Moreover, the current speed of vaccination campaigns in many countries has been slow. Natural substrates with biological immunomodulatory activity, such as glucans, may represent an adjuvant therapeutic agent to treat SARS-CoV-2. AM3, a natural glycophosphopeptical, has previously been shown to effectively slow, with no side effects, the progression of infectious respiratory diseases by regulating effects on innate and adaptive immunity in experimental models. No clinical studies, however, exist on the use of AM3 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. This review aims to summarize the beneficial effects of AM3 on respiratory diseases, the inflammatory response, modulation of immune response, and attenuation of muscle. It will also discuss its potential effects as an immune system adjuvant for the treatment of COVID-19 infections and adjuvant for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.	Mechanism;Treatment

34205917	Side Effects Reported by Jordanian Healthcare Workers Who Received COVID-19 Vaccines. Background Distribution of COVID-19 vaccines has been surrounded by suspicions and rumors making it necessary to provide the public with accurate reports from trustworthy experts such as healthcare professionals. Methods We distributed a questionnaire in Jordan among physicians, dentists and nurses who received a COVID-19 vaccine to explore the side effects (SE) they encountered after the first or the second dose of one of three vaccines namely: AstraZeneca Vaxzevria (AZ), Pfizer-BioNTeck (PB), and SinoPharm (SP) vaccines. Results A total of 409 professionals participated. Approximately 18% and 31% of participants reported no SE after the first dose and second dose, respectively. The remainder had mostly local side effects related to injection site (74%). Systemic side effects in the form of fatigue (52%), myalgia (44%), headache (42%), and fever (35%) prevailed mainly after the first dose. These were significantly associated with AZ vaccine, and age </= 45 years (p = 0.000 and 0.01, respectively). No serious SE were reported. Conclusions We can conclude that SE of COVID-19 vaccines distributed in Jordan are within the common range known so far for these vaccines. Further studies are needed to include larger sample size and longer follow-up period to monitor possible serious and long-term SE of the vaccines.	Treatment
34218099	"Lessons for and from the COVID-19 pandemic response - An appraisal of guidance for the public health management of Invasive Meningococcal Disease. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has focussed public attention on the management of communicable disease like never before. Surveillance, contact tracing, and case management are recognised as key components of outbreak prevention. Development of guidance for COVID-19 has drawn from existing management of other communicable diseases, including Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD). IMD is a rare but severe outcome of Neisseria meningitidis infection that can be prevented through vaccination. Cases still occur sporadically, requiring ongoing surveillance and consistent management. To this end, national and international public health agencies have developed and published guidance for identification and management of IMD cases. AIM: To assess national and international guidelines for the public health management of IMD, with a focus on the recommendations for identification and management of ""close contacts"" to IMD cases. METHODS: Guidelines from six national and international public health agencies were assessed using a modified version of the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) Instrument in four key domains: stakeholder involvement, developmental rigour, clarity, and applicability. A direct comparison of terminology and recommendations for identification and management of close contacts to IMD cases was also conducted. RESULTS: Guidelines from Europe and the United Kingdom rated most highly using the AGREE II Instrument, both presenting a clear, critical assessment of the strength of the available evidence, and the risks, costs, and benefits behind recommendations for management of close contacts. Direct comparison of guidelines identified inconsistencies in the language defining close contacts to IMD cases. CONCLUSION: Discrepancies between guidelines could be due to limited evidence concerning mechanisms behind disease transmission, along with the lack of a consistent process for development and review of guideline recommendations. COVID-19 management has demonstrated that international collaboration for development of public health guidance is possible, a practice that should be extended to management of other communicable diseases."

34222607	Collapse of the public health system and the emergence of new variants during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The worldwide spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the most severe public health crisis since the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. After the introduction of public health interventions aimed at reducing the number of COVID-19 cases, many countries across the world obtained success at containing the fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the pandemic. However, the SARS-CoV-2 has resurged in many countries causing a even more devastating second wave. Brazil is one the most affected countries and currently is facing one of the worst public health crises in its history. Here, we discuss the unprecedented challenges faced by the Brazilian public health system in the midst of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly regarding the collapse of the Brazilian health system and the emergence of new variants of concern (VOCs). Finally, we suggest some insights using a one health approach that will help the country to face and overcome the current COVID-19 crisis.	Prevention
34209009	COVID-19 Pandemic: Huge Stress Test for Health System Could Be a Great Opportunity to Update the Workflow in a Modern Surgical Pathology. BACKGROUND: On December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, known as COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. This disease, characterized by the rapid human-to-human transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly in more than 200 countries. Northern Italy's regions have been hit hard in terms of deaths. Here, we report the experience of the Pathology Department of the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori (INT) in Milan, the first Italian public cancer center, in the period of the lockdown that took place in Lombardy from March to May 2020. METHOD: The variation in terms of exams was calculated in two different timeframes: December 2019-February 2020 (pre-COVID-19) and March-May 2020 (COVID-19). During these periods, Turn-Around-Time (TAT) metrics released by the Lombardy Region were calculated to assess if changes applied to guarantee the safeguarding of workers affected the average diagnosis time. RESULTS: In the COVID-19 period, there was a decrease for all the performed exams. The most considerable decrease was observed for PAP tests (-81.6%), followed by biopsies (-48.8%), second opinions (-41.7%), and surgical (-31.5%), molecular (-29.4%) and cytological (-18.1%) tests. Measures applied within the Pathology Department, such as digital pathology, remote working, rotations and changes in operating procedures, improved the diagnostic performance as required by the guidelines of the Lombardy Region in terms of TAT. At the same time, the measures applied for the safeguarding of the personnel turned out to be feasible and did not affect the overall performance of the Pathology Department. CONCLUSIONS: The sharp slowdown in cancer screening during the first wave of COVID-19 could seriously endanger cancer prevention in the near future.	Prevention

34203190	Lung-Centric Inflammation of COVID-19: Potential Modulation by Vitamin D. SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory tract and leads to the disease entity, COVID-19. Accordingly, the lungs bear the greatest pathologic burden with the major cause of death being respiratory failure. However, organs remote from the initial site of infection (e.g., kidney, heart) are not spared, particularly in severe and fatal cases. Emerging evidence indicates that an excessive inflammatory response coupled with a diminished antiviral defense is pivotal in the initiation and development of COVID-19. A common finding in autopsy specimens is the presence of thrombi in the lungs as well as remote organs, indicative of immunothrombosis. Herein, the role of SARS-CoV-2 in lung inflammation and associated sequelae are reviewed with an emphasis on immunothrombosis. In as much as vitamin D is touted as a supplement to conventional therapies of COVID-19, the impact of this vitamin at various junctures of COVID-19 pathogenesis is also addressed.

34303028	CHOROIDAL CHANGES DUE TO LONG-TERM USE OF N95 FACE MASKS. PURPOSE: We aimed to examine the changes in choroidal stroma and vascular system due to long-term use of N95 mask in healthcare workers. METHOD: The healthcare workers included in the study were between the ages of 18-50, with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 10/10, spherical and cylindrical refractive errors less than 3 diopters, intraocular pressures (IOP) within normal limits, and axial lengths (AL) less than 25 mm. The choroid was imaged with enhanced depth imaging (EDI) techniques using SD-OCT. The choroidal vascularity index (CVI), total choroidal area (TA), luminal area (LA), and stromal area (SA) were measured in the subfoveal 2 mm area. Measurements were first made after wearing the N95 mask for at least 2 hours without removing it and repeated 1hour after removing, while doing office working. RESULTS: The study included 62 eyes from 62 participants (32 women [%51.61]; 30 men [%48.39]). The mean age of patients was 33.81+/- 8.88 years (20-50 years). The differences in subfoveal TA, LA, SA between 2 hours of N95 mask use and 1 hour after removal of the mask were statistically significant (p<0.05 for each). However, the difference in CVI between the mask use and removal of the mask was not statically significant (p=0.537) CONCLUSION: Due to CO2 retention and hemodynamic changes, choroidal vascular flow, the choroidal vascular area, and the choroidal stromal area may be affected by prolonged use of masks.

34224022	Increased susceptibility of human endothelial cells to infections by SARS-CoV-2 variants. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spawned a global health crisis in late 2019 and is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to elevated markers of endothelial dysfunction associated with higher risk of mortality. It is unclear whether endothelial dysfunction is caused by direct infection of endothelial cells or is mainly secondary to inflammation. Here, we investigate whether different types of endothelial cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Human endothelial cells from different vascular beds including umbilical vein endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), cardiac and lung microvascular endothelial cells, or pulmonary arterial cells were inoculated in vitro with SARS-CoV-2. Viral spike protein was only detected in HCAECs after SARS-CoV-2 infection but not in the other endothelial cells tested. Consistently, only HCAEC expressed the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), required for virus infection. Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.2 resulted in significantly higher levels of viral spike protein. Despite this, no intracellular double-stranded viral RNA was detected and the supernatant did not contain infectious virus. Analysis of the cellular distribution of the spike protein revealed that it co-localized with endosomal calnexin. SARS-CoV-2 infection did induce the ER stress gene EDEM1, which is responsible for clearance of misfolded proteins from the ER. Whereas the wild type of SARS-CoV-2 did not induce cytotoxic or pro-inflammatory effects, the variant B.1.1.7 reduced the HCAEC cell number. Of the different tested endothelial cells, HCAECs showed highest viral uptake but did not promote virus replication. Effects on cell number were only observed after infection with the variant B.1.1.7, suggesting that endothelial protection may be particularly important in patients infected with this variant.

34285080	Prescription Drug Dispensing to US Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND: After the US coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, overall prescription dispensing declined but then rebounded. Whether these same trends occurred for children is unknown. METHODS: Using the IQVIA National Prescription Audit, which contains monthly dispensing counts from 92% of US retail pharmacies, we assessed changes in the monthly number of prescriptions dispensed to US children aged 0 to 19 years during 2018-2020. We compared dispensing totals in April to December 2020 and April to December 2019 overall, by drug class, and among drug classes that typically treat acute infections (eg, antibiotics) or chronic diseases (eg, antidepressants). RESULTS: Between January 2018 and February 2020, the median monthly number of prescriptions dispensed to children was 25 744 758. Dispensing totals declined from 25 684 219 to 16 742 568 between March and April 2020, increased to 19 657 289 during October 2020, and decreased to 15 821 914 during December 2020. Dispensing totals during April to December 2020 (160 630 406) were 27.1% lower compared with April to December 2019 (220 284 613). Among the 3 drug classes accounting for the most prescriptions in 2019, the corresponding percentage changes were -55.6% for antibiotics, -11.8% for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications, and 0.1% for antidepressants. Among drug classes that typically treat acute infections and chronic diseases, percentage changes were -51.3% and -17.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription dispensing to children declined by one-quarter in April to December 2020 compared with April to December 2019. Declines were greater for infection-related drugs than for chronic disease drugs. Decreased dispensing of the latter is potentially concerning and warrants further investigation. Whether reductions in dispensing of infection-related drugs are temporary or sustained will be important to monitor going forward.	Prevention
34211113	Lagged meteorological impacts on COVID-19 incidence among high-risk counties in the United States-a spatiotemporal analysis. BACKGROUND: The associations between meteorological factors and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been discussed globally; however, because of short study periods, the lack of considering lagged effects, and different study areas, results from the literature were diverse and even contradictory. OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this study is to conduct more reliable research to evaluate the lagged meteorological impacts on COVID-19 incidence by considering a relatively long study period and diversified high-risk areas in the United States. METHODS: This study adopted the distributed lagged nonlinear model with a spatial function to analyze COVID-19 incidence predicted by multiple meteorological measures from March to October of 2020 across 203 high-risk counties in the United States. The estimated spatial function was further smoothed within the entire continental United States by the biharmonic spline interpolation. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that the maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity, and precipitation were the best meteorological predictors. Most significantly positive associations were found from 3 to 11 lagged days in lower levels of each selected meteorological factor. In particular, a significantly positive association appeared in minimum relative humidity higher than 88.36% at 5-day lag. The spatial analysis also shows excessive risks in the north-central United States. SIGNIFICANCE: The research findings can contribute to the implementation of early warning surveillance of COVID-19 by using weather forecasting for up to two weeks in high-risk counties.	Prevention

34365925	The Impact of Deranged Glucose Metabolism and Diabetes in The Pathogenesis and Prognosis of The Novel Sars-Cov-2: A Systematic Review of Literature. BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, has constituted one of the most serious health challenges of the century, globally. The causative organism was initially named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) but has subsequently been renamed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic has so far infected several million and killed about a million people worldwide. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the leading causes of morbidity worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To examine the critical role diabetes plays in the pathogenesis and prognosis of COVID-19 and to assess the emerging therapies available to fight the pandemic. METHODS: Authors conducted a systematic review of literature to examine the role of diabetes as a comorbidity in the pathogenesis and prognosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: Both experimental and observational data from early 2020 suggested that most people with COVID-19 have comorbidities, the most dominant of which are diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Empirical evidence indicates that diabetic patients infected with the COVID-19 disease had the worst outcomes concerning morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: A combination of underlying chronic conditions such as hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases together with altered ACE receptor expression, immune dysregulation via cytokine storm, alveolar and endothelial dysfunction, increased systemic coagulation may put individuals with diabetes at risk for COVID-19 severity. More studies are needed to elucidate how glucose-lowering drugs may modulate the host immune response in diabetic individuals, especially following the administration of potential COVID-19 vaccines.

34207573	Outcomes of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in COVID-19 Patients: A Propensity-Matched Analysis. It remains unclear to what extent the outcomes and complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) differ from non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. In an observational, propensity-matched study, outcomes after ECMO support were compared between 19 COVID-19 patients suffering from ARDS (COVID group) and 34 matched non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (NCOVID group) from our historical cohort. A 1:2 propensity matching was performed based on respiratory ECMO survival prediction (RESP) score, age, gender, bilirubin, and creatinine levels. Patients' characteristics, laboratory parameters, adverse events, and 90-day survival were analyzed. Patients' characteristics in COVID and NCOVID groups were similar. Before ECMO initiation, fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in the COVID group (median: 493 vs. 364 mg/dL, p < 0.001). Median ECMO support duration was similar (16 vs. 13 days, p = 0.714, respectively). During ECMO therapy, patients in the COVID group developed significantly more thromboembolic events (TEE) than did those in the NCOVID group (42% vs. 12%, p = 0.031), which were mainly pulmonary artery embolism (PAE) (26% vs. 0%, p = 0.008). The rate of major bleeding events (42% vs. 62%, p = 0.263) was similar. Fibrinogen decreased significantly more in the COVID group than in the NCOVID group (p < 0.001), whereas D-dimer increased in the COVID group (p = 0.011). Additionally, 90-day mortality did not differ (47% vs. 74%; p = 0.064) between COVID and NCOVID groups. Compared with that in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients, ECMO support in COVID-19 patients was associated with comparable in-hospital mortality and similar bleeding rates but a higher incidence of TEE, especially PAE. In contrast, coagulation parameters differed between COVID and NCOVID patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34208607	Serology in COVID-19: Comparison of Two Methods. BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to examine the performance of two assays in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: A total of 127 COVID-19 disease contacts from the Infectious Diseases Department were included. Two serological tests were used: SARS-CoV-2 IgG CMIA on the Alinity system (Abbott) and LIAISON((R)) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG CLIA (DiaSorin). RESULTS: The assays exhibited a 96.85% (123/127 patients) test result agreement. In two cases, the positive results obtained by SARS-CoV-2 IgG CMIA on the Alinity system (Abbott) were negative based on the LIAISON((R)) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG CLIA (DiaSorin) test, and in two cases, negative results from the LIAISON((R)) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG CLIA (DiaSorin) test were positive with the SARS-CoV-2 IgG CMIA on the Alinity system (Abbott). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of our study, we conclude that in population medicine, the assessments of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus based on spike protein or nucleocapsid protein show comparable effectiveness.

34292712	New Impedimetric Sandwich Immunosensor for Ultrasensitive and Highly Specific Detection of Spike Receptor Binding Domain Protein of SARS-CoV-2. An impedance sensing platform-combined conducting nanocomposite layer was fabricated to develop an effective and rapid method for detection of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) specific spike receptor binding domain (RBD) protein, a precious antigen marker of COVID-19 disease. Coronavirus infection has spread globally and swiftly with major impacts on health, economy, and quality of life of communities. Fast and reliable detection of COVID-19 is a very significant issue for the effective treatment of this bad illness. For this aim, first, an Epoxy functional group-substituted thiophene monomer was synthesized and electrodeposited on a single-use indium tin oxide (ITO) platform in the presence of acetylene black by employing a cyclic voltammetry technique; thus, a conducting nanocomposite (C-NC) layer with high conductivity was obtained. This composite was electrodeposited for the first time on the ITO surface to generate a facile and cost-effective impedimetric biosensor. In addition, this composite provided proper attachment points for antibody binding and also supported the biosensor construction. The immuno-specific biointeractions between anti-RBD and RBD proteins hampered the electron transfer between the ITO substrate surface and electrolyte, and this reaction caused variations in impedance signals, and these signals were proportional to the immobilized RBD antigen amounts. The as-prepared immunosensor showed a wide linear dynamic range (0.0012-120 pg/mL), an ultra-low detection limit of 0.58 fg/mL with added superiorities of great selectivity, suitable repeatability, multiple reusability, and excellent reproducibility.

34226756	Optimal quarantine-related strategies for COVID-19 control models. At the time when this paper was written, quarantine-related strategies (from full lockdown to some relaxed preventive measures) were the only available measure to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. However, long-term quarantine and especially full lockdown is an extremely expensive measure. To explore the possibility of controlling and suppressing the COVID-19 epidemic at the lowest possible cost, we apply optimal control theory. In this paper, we create two controlled Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) type models describing the spread of COVID-19 in a human population. For each model, we solve an optimal control problem and find the optimal quarantine strategy that ensures the minimal level of the infected population at the lowest possible cost. The properties of the corresponding optimal controls are established analytically using the Pontryagin maximum principle. The optimal solutions, obtained numerically, validate our analytical results. Additionally, for both controlled models, we find explicit formulas for the basic reproductive ratios in the presence of a constant control and show that while the epidemic can be eventually stopped under long-term quarantine measures of maximum strength (full lockdown), the strength of quarantine can be reduced under the optimal quarantine policies. The behavior of the appropriate optimal solutions and their dependence on the basic reproductive ratio, population density, and the duration of quarantine are discussed, and practically relevant conclusions are made.

34209586	NLRP3 and Infections: beta-Amyloid in Inflammasome beyond Neurodegeneration. Amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced abnormal neuroinflammation is recognized as a major pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which results in memory impairment. Research exploring low-grade systemic inflammation and its impact on the development and progression of neurodegenerative disease has increased. A particular research focus has been whether systemic inflammation arises only as a secondary effect of disease, or it is also a cause of pathology. The inflammasomes, and more specifically the NLRP3 inflammasome, are crucial components of the innate immune system and are usually activated in response to infection or tissue damage. Although inflammasome activation plays critical roles against various pathogens in host defense, overactivation of inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including acute central nervous system (CNS) injuries and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. This review summarizes the current literature on the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of AD, and its involvement in infections, particularly SARS-CoV-2. NLRP3 might represent the crossroad between the hypothesized neurodegeneration and the primary COVID-19 infection.	Mechanism;Treatment
34339604	Microstructured Surfaces for Reducing Chances of Fomite Transmission via Virus-Containing Respiratory Droplets. Evaporation-induced particle aggregation in drying droplets is of significant importance in the prevention of pathogen transfer due to the possibility of indirect fomite transmission of the infectious virus particles. In this study, particle aggregation was directionally controlled using contact line dynamics (pinned or slipping) and geometrical gradients on microstructured surfaces by the systematic investigation of the evaporation process on sessile droplets and sprayed microdroplets laden with virus-simulant nanoparticles. Using this mechanism, we designed robust particle capture surfaces by significantly inhibiting the contact transfer of particles from fomite surfaces. For the proof-of-concept, interconnected hexagonal and inverted pyramidal microwall were fabricated using ultraviolet-based nanoimprint lithography, which is considered to be a promising scalable manufacturing process. We demonstrated the potentials of an engineered microcavity surface to limit the contact transfer of particle aggregates deposited with the evaporation of microdroplets by 93% for hexagonal microwall and by 96% for inverted pyramidal microwall. The particle capture potential of the interconnected microstructures was also investigated using biological particles, including adenoviruses and lung-derived extracellular vesicles. The findings indicate that the proposed microstructured surfaces can reduce the indirect fomite transmission of highly infectious agents, including norovirus, rotavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, via respiratory droplets.

34226467	Clinical Presentation, Management and In-Hospital Outcome of COVID-19 among Non-Healthcare Personnel and Healthcare Personnel in a Tertiary Cardiac Care Hospital. The huge numbers of non-healthcare personnel (non-HCP) who get infected by corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) not only paralyze health care systems but also put health care personnel (HCP) at potential risk globally. Objective of the study was to compare the Healthcare personnel (HCP) and non-HCP COVID-19 cases. This prospective observational study was carried out in National Heart Foundation Hospital and Research Institute of Bangladesh from March 08, 2020 to July 20, 2020. During this study period all admitted non-HCP who subsequently was diagnosed as COVID-19 positive by rRT-PCR and HCP of this hospital, who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms or came in close contact with COVID-19 patients at home or their workplace and become COVID-19 positive, were included. Out of 320 infected patients, 181(56.6%) patients were non-HCP and 139(43.4%) were HCP. Non-HCP were older than HCP (Mean age: 52.95+/-13.82 years vs. 34.08+/-11.11 years; p=0.001). Non-HCP were predominantly male and HCP were predominantly female (73.5% vs. 41% & 26.5% vs. 59%; p=0.001). Non-HCP had more risk factors and co-morbidities than HCP (p=0.001). Typical symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever and cough were prevalent in HCP. More aggressive treatment was required for non-HCP. Non-HCP had more severe disease and higher case fatality rate (9.4% vs. 0.7%; p=0.001) than HCP. Disease severity (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.15) and DM (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.94) were the independent predictor of mortality. Non-HCP was older in age, predominantly male and had more co-morbidities than HCP. Typical symptoms of COVID-19 were prevalent in HCP. Non-HCP had more severe disease and higher case fatality rate than HCP.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34345337	Inter and Intra-Rater Reliability of Measuring Photometric Craniovertebral Angle Using a Cloud-Based Video Communication Platform. Objective: Due to social distancing guidelines during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, most providers and patients have wanted to avoid close contact. This makes physical therapy (PT) assessments difficult because of the lack of empirical evidence about the reliability of various clinical measurements performed in a virtual environment. One such procedure is the photometric measurement of craniovertebral (CV) angle. Craniovertebral angle measurement is usually performed in an outpatient setting and is defined as the acute angle formed between a straight line connecting the spinous process of C7 to the tragus of the ear, and the horizontal line passing through the spinous process of the C7. Although the photometric measurement of CV angles is considered both valid and reliable in the clinics, no empirical evidence exists about the CV angle measurement reliability when performed in a virtual environment. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the inter- and intra-rater reliability of photometric CV angle measurement using a cloud-based video communication platform. Number of Subjects: 66 subjects (57 females). Methods: All measurements were performed by two final year PT students who had completed the musculoskeletal part of the curriculum and were blinded to each other's measurements. Each subject was photographed in two postures over a HIPAA-compliant video-based telehealth platform: (1) normal/relaxed posture and (2) ideal posture (posture the subject considered good). Student researcher 1 measured the CV angle in both the relaxed posture and ideal posture, while student researcher 2 measured the CV angle only in the relaxed posture. Each subject's CV angle measurement was performed three times on three separate days and the means were used for further analysis. The shape of the CV angle frequency distribution was assessed using kurtosis and skewness values. Rater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and interpreted based on the guidelines provided by Portney and Watkins (2009). Results: The CV angles were normally distributed in both relaxed and ideal postures. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of relaxed posture was 50.7o +/- 6.3o with kurtosis and skewness of 0.67 and -0.74 respectively. The mean and SD of ideal posture was 55.5o +/- 5.4o, with kurtosis and skewness of 0.1 and -0.54 respectively. The ICC for inter-rater reliability in the relaxed posture was 0.88 and the ICC for intra-rater reliability for relaxed posture was 0.91. Conclusions: Craniovertebral angles were normally distributed in the sample. An acceptable level of inter- and intra-rater reliability can be attained when measuring CV angle using a cloud-based video communication platform.	Prevention
34225487	Replicative Fitness of a SARS-CoV-2 20I/501Y.V1 Variant from Lineage B.1.1.7 in Human Reconstituted Bronchial Epithelium. Since its emergence in 2019, circulating populations of the new coronavirus (CoV) continuously acquired genetic diversity. At the end of 2020, a variant named 20I/501Y.V1 (lineage B.1.1.7) emerged and replaced other circulating strains in several regions. This phenomenon has been poorly associated with biological evidence that this variant and the original strain exhibit different phenotypic characteristics. Here, we analyze the replication ability of this new variant in different cellular models using for comparison an ancestral D614G European strain (lineage B1). Results from comparative replication kinetics experiments in vitro and in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium showed no difference. However, when both viruses were put in competition in human reconstituted bronchial epithelium, the 20I/501Y.V1 variant outcompeted the ancestral strain. All together, these findings demonstrate that this new variant replicates more efficiently and may contribute to a better understanding of the progressive replacement of circulating strains by the severe acute respiratory CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) 20I/501Y.V1 variant. IMPORTANCE The emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants raised numerous questions concerning the future course of the pandemic. We are currently observing a replacement of the circulating viruses by the variant from the United Kingdom known as 20I/501Y.V1, from the B.1.1.7 lineage, but there is little biological evidence that this new variant exhibits a different phenotype. In the present study, we used different cellular models to assess the replication ability of the 20I/501Y.V1 variant. Our results showed that this variant replicates more efficiently in human reconstituted bronchial epithelium, which may explain why it spreads so rapidly in human populations.	Mechanism
34374351	Performance Comparison of Five SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Assays for Seroprevalence Studies. Background: Seroprevalence studies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, including asymptomatic and past infections, are important to estimate the scale of the disease outbreak and to establish quarantine measures. We evaluated the clinical performance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody assays available in Korea for use in seroprevalence studies. Methods: The sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, and interference of five SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays were evaluated using the following: 398 serum samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients, 510 negative control samples from before 2018 (pre-pandemic), 163 serum samples from patients with SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and other viral infections, and five samples for the interference study. Results: The sensitivities of the five assays ranged from 92.2% to 98%, and their specificities, including cross-reactivity and interference, ranged from 97.5% to 100%. The agreement rates were excellent (kappa >0.9). Adjustment of the cutoff values could be considered through ROC curve analysis. The positive predictive values of the individual assays varied from 3.5% to 100% at a 0.1% prevalence but were as high as >/=95% when two assays were combined. Conclusions: The prevalence of COVID-19 in Korea is considered to be exceptionally low at present; thus, we recommend using a combination of two or more SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays rather than a single assay. These results could help select SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays for COVID-19 seroprevalence studies in Korea.	Diagnosis
34375739	Ovarian Vein Thrombosis after Pelvic Surgery in Patient with Recent Coronavirus Disease 2019. An abundance of literature has demonstrated that Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) contributes to a hypercoagulable state that is associated with venous thromboembolic events. Data on post-operative complications following mild COVID-19 infection is limited. We report a case of ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) following pelvic surgery in a patient with a recent mild COVID-19 infection. The patient presented with complaints of fever and worsening right-sided abdominal pain postoperatively and was found to have a right OVT. Thrombophilia workup was negative. The hypercoagulable state of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 may have implications on postoperative complications after gynecologic surgery even in cases of mild infection. Further research is needed to determine the optimal thromboembolic prophylaxis for patients undergoing pelvic surgery after COVID-19 infection.	Case Report
34288939	"Knowledge and awareness-based survey of COVID-19 within the eye care profession in Nepal: Misinformation is hiding the truth. BACKGROUND: Nepal was under a severe lockdown for several months in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were concerns regarding misinformation circulating on social media. This study aimed to analyse the knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 amongst eye care professionals in Nepal during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODOLOGY: We invited 600 participants from 12 ophthalmic centres across Nepal to complete a qualitative, anonymous online survey. Altogether, 25 questions (both open and closed-ended) were used. An overall performance score was calculated from the average of the 12 ""Knowledge"" questions for all the participants. RESULTS: Of the 600 eye care professionals invited, 310 (51%) participated in the survey. The symptoms of COVID-19 were known to 94%, whilst only 49% of the participants were aware how the disease was transmitted, with 54% aware that anyone can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Almost 98% of participants recognized the World Health Organization's (WHO) awareness message, but surprisingly, 41% of participants felt that consumption of hot drinks helps to destroy the virus, in contradiction to WHO information. Importantly, 95% of the participants were aware of personal protective equipment (PPE) and what the acronym stands for. Social distancing was felt to be key to limiting the disease spread; whilst 41% disagreed that PPE should be mandatory for eye care practitioners. The mean overall ""Knowledge"" performance score was 69.65% (SD +/- 22.81). CONCLUSION: There is still considerable scope to improve the knowledge of COVID-19 amongst ophthalmic professionals in Nepal. Opinion is also split on measures to prevent transmission, with misinformation potentially fuelling confusion. It is recommended to follow WHO and national guidelines, whilst seeking published scientific evidence behind any unofficial statements, to accurately inform one's clinical practice."	Prevention
34289274	Effectiveness of Covid-19 Vaccines against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant. BACKGROUND: The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), has contributed to a surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe, including a notable increase in cases in the United Kingdom. The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against this variant has been unclear. METHODS: We used a test-negative case-control design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant or the predominant strain (B.1.1.7, or alpha variant) over the period that the delta variant began circulating. Variants were identified with the use of sequencing and on the basis of the spike (S) gene status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of Covid-19 in England were used to estimate the proportion of cases with either variant according to the patients' vaccination status. RESULTS: Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was notably lower among persons with the delta variant (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 to 35.7) than among those with the alpha variant (48.7%; 95% CI, 45.5 to 51.7); the results were similar for both vaccines. With the BNT162b2 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.3) among persons with the alpha variant and 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant. With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 74.5% (95% CI, 68.4 to 79.4) among persons with the alpha variant and 67.0% (95% CI, 61.3 to 71.8) among those with the delta variant. CONCLUSIONS: Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the delta variant as compared with the alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked after the receipt of the first dose. This finding would support efforts to maximize vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable populations. (Funded by Public Health England.).	Treatment
34208751	Coordinate Induction of Humoral and Spike Specific T-Cell Response in a Cohort of Italian Health Care Workers Receiving BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine. Vaccination is the main public health measure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and hospitalization, and a massive worldwide scientific effort resulted in the rapid development of effective vaccines. This work aimed to define the dynamics of humoral and cell-mediated immune response in a cohort of health care workers (HCWs) who received a two-dose BNT162b2-mRNA vaccination. The serological response was evaluated by quantifying the anti-RBD and neutralizing antibodies. The cell-mediated response was performed by a whole blood test quantifying Th1 cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2), produced in response to spike peptides. The BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine induced both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against spike peptides in virtually all HCWs without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a moderate inverse relation with age in the anti-RBD response. Spike-specific T cells produced several Th1 cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2), which correlated with the specific-serological response. Overall, our study describes the ability of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to elicit a coordinated neutralizing humoral and spike-specific T cell response in HCWs. Assessing the dynamics of these parameters by an easy immune monitoring protocol can allow for the evaluation of the persistence of the vaccine response in order to define the optimal vaccination strategy.

34217339	The predicting roles of carcinoembryonic antigen and its underlying mechanism in the progression of coronavirus disease 2019. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has induced a worldwide epidemiological event with a high infectivity and mortality. However, the predicting biomarkers and their potential mechanism in the progression of COVID-19 are not well known. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the candidate predictors of COVID-19 and investigate their underlying mechanism. METHODS: The retrospective study was conducted to identify the potential laboratory indicators with prognostic values of COVID-19 disease. Then, the prognostic nomogram was constructed to predict the overall survival of COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the scRNA-seq data of BALF and PBMCs from COVID-19 patients were downloaded to investigate the underlying mechanism of the most important prognostic indicators in lungs and peripherals, respectively. RESULTS: In total, 304 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital were included in the retrospective study. CEA was the only laboratory indicator with significant difference in the univariate (P < 0.001) and multivariate analysis (P = 0.020). The scRNA-seq data of BALF and PBMCs from COVID-19 patients were downloaded to investigate the underlying mechanism of CEA in lungs and peripherals, respectively. The results revealed the potential roles of CEA were significantly distributed in type II pneumocytes of BALF and developing neutrophils of PBMCs, participating in the progression of COVID-19 by regulating the cell-cell communication. CONCLUSION: This study identifies the prognostic roles of CEA in COVID-19 patients and implies the potential roles of CEACAM8-CEACAM6 in the progression of COVID-19 by regulating the cell-cell communication of developing neutrophils and type II pneumocyte.

34285130	A recombinant spike protein subunit vaccine confers protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in hamsters. Multiple safe and effective vaccines that elicit immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are necessary to respond to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here, we developed a protein subunit vaccine comprised of spike ectodomain protein (StriFK) plus a nitrogen bisphosphonate-modified zinc-aluminum hybrid adjuvant (FH002C). StriFK-FH002C generated substantially higher neutralizing antibody titers in mice, hamsters, and cynomolgus monkeys than those observed in plasma isolated from COVID-19 convalescent individuals. StriFK-FH002C also induced both Th1- and Th2-polarized helper T cell responses in mice. In hamsters, StriFK-FH002C immunization protected animals against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, as shown by absence of virus-induced weight loss, fewer symptoms of disease, and reduced lung pathology. Vaccination of hamsters with StriFK-FH002C also reduced within-cage virus transmission to unvaccinated, cohoused hamsters. In summary, StriFK-FH002C represents an effective, protein subunit-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.	Mechanism;Transmission;Treatment
34204591	Diabetic Retinopathy Screening and Registration in Europe-Narrative Review. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable vision impairment and blindness in the European Region. Despite the fact that almost all European countries have some kind of prophylactic eye examination for people with diabetes, the examinations are not properly arranged and are not organized according to the principles of screening in medicine. In 2021, the current COVID-19 pandemic moved telemedicine to the forefront healthcare services. Due to that, a lot more patients could benefit from comfortable and faster access to ophthalmology specialist care. This study aimed to conduct a narrative literature review on current DR screening programs and registries in the European Union for the last 20 years. With the implementation of telemedicine in daily medical practice, performing screening programs became much more attainable. Remote assessment of retinal pictures simultaneously saves countries time, money, and other resources.	Prevention
34335019	Forecasting Multi-Wave Epidemics Through Bayesian Inference. We present a simple, near-real-time Bayesian method to infer and forecast a multiwave outbreak, and demonstrate it on the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach uses timely epidemiological data that has been widely available for COVID-19. It provides short-term forecasts of the outbreak's evolution, which can then be used for medical resource planning. The method postulates one- and multiwave infection models, which are convolved with the incubation-period distribution to yield competing disease models. The disease models' parameters are estimated via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and information-theoretic criteria are used to select between them for use in forecasting. The method is demonstrated on two- and three-wave COVID-19 outbreaks in California, New Mexico and Florida, as observed during Summer-Winter 2020. We find that the method is robust to noise, provides useful forecasts (along with uncertainty bounds) and that it reliably detected when the initial single-wave COVID-19 outbreaks transformed into successive surges as containment efforts in these states failed by the end of Spring 2020.

34282992	Effects of a remotely supervised motor rehabilitation program for individuals with Rett syndrome at home. PURPOSE: In this study, the effect of a remotely supervised, home-based, family-centered individualized rehabilitation program of motor activities for individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT) was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen participants with classic genetically confirmed RTT followed by a three-month program of motor activities at home. A total of 47 rehabilitative goals were set. Goals achievement, motor function, and parental satisfaction were evaluated. Each program was carried out by the participant's parents and remotely supervised via Skype calls, twice by a therapist experienced in RTT rehabilitation. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (78.7%) rehabilitative goals were achieved or overachieved. Ten participants (76.9%) significantly increased their gross motor functional level with a medium size effect (0.604). Parental reports of the involved families suggest, on average, a high level of usefulness of the program (4.4/5), adherence to the program (4.4/5), and general satisfaction (4.5/5). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly support the implementation of such programs for this population. As these programs were remotely supervised, they can be implemented when the children are away from referenced facilities for long durations, such as during long holidays or a Covid-19 type lockdown.Implications for rehabilitationA remote supervised motor activity program carried out by the primary caregiver supports motor functioning in RTT.Therapists should consider family members' motivation to carry out the activities and integrate them into the family's daily routine.The program should be flexible to adapt to any sudden change in medical and environmental conditions, functional ability, and family members' motivational levels.

34285719	The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalizations and plasmapheresis therapy in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: a nationwide analysis from Germany. Background: Many countries worldwide reported side effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that have influenced the care of patients with other diseases in both acute and elective settings. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) represent the major patient population suffering from an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. We aimed to analyze MS and NMOSD hospitalizations, the application of plasmapheresis therapy, and the dynamic during different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Methods: We conducted a nationwide retrospective cross-sectional study using the administrative database of all hospitalized patients with the main diagnosis of MS and NMOSD, including the information on the application of plasmapheresis therapy. We included full-year data from 1463 hospitals of all MS and NMOSD patients hospitalized in 2019 and 2020 in Germany (n = 87,453). We compared case numbers and plasmapheresis therapy rates of the different pandemic periods in 2020 with the corresponding periods in 2019. Results: We observed a substantial decline of MS and NMOSD patients' hospitalizations during the different pandemic periods, with the most remarkable decline during the first wave of the pandemic (First diagnosis of MS: -16.8%; relapsing-remitting MS: -34.0%; secondary progressive MS: -48.9%; primary progressive MS: -43.8%; NMOSD: -19.2%). Treatment rates with plasmapheresis increased for MS and NMOSD patients in 2020 compared to 2019 (1.8% versus 1.6%, p = 0.003; 14.0% versus 9.3%, p < 0.001), with a substantial increase during the first wave of the pandemic, especially in NMOSD patients (19.7% versus 8.4%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: There was a marked decline of MS and NMOSD patients' hospitalizations during the different pandemic periods in 2020, with the most substantial reduction during the pandemic's first wave and in progressive MS patients. MS and NMOSD patients who needed rescue relapse treatment continued to receive plasmapheresis therapy in Germany.	Prevention
34198716	A Comparison of Vaccine Hesitancy of COVID-19 Vaccination in China and the United States. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the differences in vaccine hesitancy and preference of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines between two countries, namely, China and the United States (U.S.). METHOD: A cross-national survey was conducted in both China and the United States, and discrete choice experiments, as well as Likert scales, were utilized to assess vaccine preference and the underlying factors contributing to vaccination acceptance. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to enable a direct comparison between the two countries. RESULTS: A total of 9077 (5375 and 3702 from China and the United States, respectively) respondents completed the survey. After propensity score matching, over 82.0% of respondents from China positively accepted the COVID-19 vaccination, while 72.2% of respondents from the United States positively accepted it. Specifically, only 31.9% of Chinese respondents were recommended by a doctor to have COVID-19 vaccination, while more than half of the U.S. respondents were recommended by a doctor (50.2%), local health board (59.4%), or friends and families (64.8%). The discrete choice experiments revealed that respondents from the United States attached the greatest importance to the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (44.41%), followed by the cost of vaccination (29.57%), whereas those from China held a different viewpoint, that the cost of vaccination covered the largest proportion in their trade-off (30.66%), and efficacy ranked as the second most important attribute (26.34%). Additionally, respondents from China tended to be much more concerned about the adverse effect of vaccination (19.68% vs. 6.12%) and have a lower perceived severity of being infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Although the overall acceptance and hesitancy of COVID-19 vaccination in both countries are high, underpinned distinctions between these countries were observed. Owing to the differences in COVID-19 incidence rates, cultural backgrounds, and the availability of specific COVID-19 vaccines in the two countries, vaccine rollout strategies should be nation-dependent.

34288684	Exponential Amplification Using Photoredox Autocatalysis. Exponential molecular amplification such as the polymerase chain reaction is a powerful tool that allows ultrasensitive biodetection. Here, we report a new exponential amplification strategy based on photoredox autocatalysis, where eosin Y, a photocatalyst, amplifies itself by activating a nonfluorescent eosin Y derivative (EYH(3-)) under green light. The deactivated photocatalyst is stable and rapidly activated under low-intensity light, making the eosin Y amplification suitable for resource-limited settings. Through steady-state kinetic studies and reaction modeling, we found that EYH(3-) is either oxidized to eosin Y via one-electron oxidation by triplet eosin Y and subsequent 1e(-)/H(+) transfer, or activated by singlet oxygen with the risk of degradation. By reducing the rate of the EYH(3-) degradation, we successfully improved EYH(3-)-to-eosin Y recovery, achieving efficient autocatalytic eosin Y amplification. Additionally, to demonstrate its flexibility in output signals, we coupled the eosin Y amplification with photoinduced chromogenic polymerization, enabling sensitive visual detection of analytes. Finally, we applied the exponential amplification methods in developing bioassays for detection of biomarkers including SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, an antigen used in the diagnosis of COVID-19.

34286192	Making trials part of good clinical care: lessons from the RECOVERY trial. When COVID-19 hit the UK in early 2020, there were no known treatments for a condition that results in the death of around one in four patients hospitalised with this disease. Around the world, possible treatments were administered to huge numbers of patients, without any reliable assessments of safety and efficacy. The rapid generation of high-quality evidence was vital. RECOVERY is a streamlined, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial, which was set up in response to this challenge. As of April 2021, over 39,000 patients have been enrolled from 178 hospital sites in the UK. Within 100 days of its initiation, RECOVERY demonstrated that dexamethasone improves survival for patients with severe disease; a result that was rapidly implemented in the UK and internationally saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Importantly, it also showed that other widely used treatments (such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin) have no meaningful benefit for hospitalised patients. This was only possible through randomisation of large numbers of patients and the adoption of streamlined and pragmatic procedures focused on quality, together with widespread collaboration focused on a single goal. RECOVERY illustrates how clinical trials and healthcare can be integrated, even in a pandemic. This approach provides new opportunities to generate the evidence needed for high-quality healthcare not only for a pandemic but for the many other conditions that place a burden on patients and the healthcare system.

34200335	Intention-Based Critical Factors Affecting Willingness to Adopt Novel Coronavirus Prevention in Pakistan: Implications for Future Pandemics. Since human beings have a long tradition of coexistence with pandemics, which may profoundly impact them, adopting preventive measures is crucial for humankind's survival. This study explores the intention-based critical factors affecting the willingness of individuals to adopt pandemic prevention. To this end, a representative sample of 931 Pakistanis filled in an online questionnaire. However, only 828 questionnaires were found to be complete and valid for path modeling analysis. The core findings are as follows: Firstly, peer groups' beliefs, self-efficacy, perceived risk, pandemic knowledge, ease of pandemic prevention adoption, and risk-averse behavior are revealed as driving forces of the individuals' willingness to adopt pandemic prevention. Contrastingly, a lack of trust in political will and mythical attitude towards pandemics are uncovered as inhibitors. Nevertheless, moral values depict a neutral role. Secondly, the peer groups' beliefs are highest ranked, followed by the lack of trust in political will and a mythical attitude towards pandemic prevention. Finally, moral values are determined as the lowest-ranked critical factor. Based on these results, the government should promote awareness campaigns on lethality and fatality of the pandemic at both centralized and decentralized levels to win people's trust at the grass-roots level and overcome the mythical attitude of individuals at all societal levels. Besides, access to personal protective gears should be made feasible since an easier pandemic prevention adoption would increase the individuals' willingness to adopt such preventative measures.

34211863	"A Systematic Review on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Neurosurgical Practice and Indian Perspective. Objective: The study objective was to systematically review the impact of the current pandemic on neurosurgical practice and to find out a safe way of practicing neurosurgery amid the highly infectious patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A review of the PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed. The literature was systematically searched using keywords such as ""COVID-19"" and ""Neurosurgery."" Results: Among the 425 records, 128 articles were found to be eligible for analysis. These articles described the perspectives of the neurosurgical departments during the pandemic, departmental models, and organizational schemes for triaging emergent and nonemergent neurosurgical cases for the optimal utilization of limited resources, and solutions to continue academic and research activities. Triaging systems help us to optimally utilize the limited resources available. Guidelines have been developed for safe neurosurgical practice and for the continuation of clinical and academic activities during this pandemic by various national and international neurosurgical societies. Key changes in the telemedicine regulatory guidelines would help us to continue to provide neurosurgical care. Videoconferences, online education programs, and webinars could help us to overcome the disadvantages brought upon the neurosurgical education by the social-distancing norms. Conclusion: In an unprecedented time like this, no single algorithm is going to clear the ethical dilemma faced by us. Individual patient triage is a way for maintaining our ethical practice and at the same time, for efficiently utilizing the limited resources. As the pandemic progresses, new guidelines and protocols will continue to evolve for better neurosurgical practice."	Prevention
34223287	PORTABLE SINGLE-LEAD ELECTROCARDIOGRAM DEVICE IS ACCURATE FOR QTc EVALUATION IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: Many commonly used drugs can prolong the QTc interval (QTc), which can lead to potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. In the current era of COVID-19 pandemic, it is worth mentioning that the disease itself and several drugs used for its treatment have been associated with QTc prolongation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the agreement and clinical precision of a portable single-lead ECG device to measure the QTc interval compared to the standard 12-lead ECG. METHODS: In sequential tests, QTc of ECG recordings obtained with the device KardiaMobile (KM-1L) (AliveCor(R)) were compared to QTc obtained with conventional 12-lead ECG. Agreement was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots and the Lin's concordance coefficient. Consistency between the two devices in determining QTc prolongation (QTc >/=470 ms in males, or >/=480 ms in females), was evaluated with kappa statistics. RESULTS: 128 patients with a presumed or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to a University Hospital were included. QTc intervals measured with KM were similar to QTc measured with conventional ECG (442.45+/-40.5 vs. 441.65+/-40.3 ms, p:0.15). Bland-Altman analysis showed no significant difference in QTc values (average difference of -0.797, 95% Limits Of Agreement:-13.179;11.585). Lin's concordance coefficient showed an excellent agreement (0.988, p<0.001). Concordance between the two devices for determining QTc prolongation was excellent (Kappa>0.90). CONCLUSION: ECG recordings obtained with KM-1L allow an accurate QTc interval assessment. Considering its simplicity of use, this approach has advantages over conventional ECG and can provide an alternative for the evaluation of QTc in hospitalized patients, during the current time of pandemic by COVID-19 and beyond.

The resulting Mapper graphs provide visualizations of the pandemic that are more complete than those supplied by other, more standard methods. They allow for easy comparisons of the features of the pandemic across time and space and encode a variety of geometric features of the data cloud created from geographic information, time progression, and the number of COVID-19 cases. The Mapper graphs reflect the development of the pandemic across all of the U.S. and capture the growth rates as well as the regional prominence of hot-spots.	Prevention
34376339	Appointment impact and orthodontic emergency occurrence during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A retrospective study. INTRODUCTION: This retrospective study aimed to quantify the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the orthodontic appointment and make an analysis of orthodontic emergencies (OEs) that occurred during the pandemic. METHODS: A total of 628 patients were randomly sampled from 3489 subjects who were undergoing active orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances, and the medical records were reviewed. OE occurrence was analyzed from 617 patients who had explicit return-visit records after the COVID-19 outbreak. Wilcoxon signed rank tests, chi-square tests, and a binary logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: The return-visit of 98.6% of the patients was delayed significantly with an increase over 8.98 +/- 4.76 weeks (P <0.001). In general, 32.3% of the patients suffered from various OEs while waiting for their first return-visit, and bracket or band debonding was the most frequently reported category. Most OEs did not receive timely treatments because of the lockdown. The incidence was nearly 2 times higher than that of the normal appointment times. No correlation was found between OE occurrence and different demographic and clinical characteristics of patients. The therapeutic progress of patients, especially those in stage 3, was postponed because of the occurrence of OEs. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the limitations, our study suggested that it is highly possible that the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed appointments of fixed orthodontic patients. OEs did bother a minority of patients and could not be settled in time during the lockdown, which had a negative impact on the near-term treatment progress and should have been prevented. Further studies are required to investigate the long-dated influence of COVID-19 on orthodontic practices.	Prevention
34222166	Statistical Modeling for the Prediction of Infectious Disease Dissemination With Special Reference to COVID-19 Spread. In this review, we have discussed the different statistical modeling and prediction techniques for various infectious diseases including the recent pandemic of COVID-19. The distribution fitting, time series modeling along with predictive monitoring approaches, and epidemiological modeling are illustrated. When the epidemiology data is sufficient to fit with the required sample size, the normal distribution in general or other theoretical distributions are fitted and the best-fitted distribution is chosen for the prediction of the spread of the disease. The infectious diseases develop over time and we have data on the single variable that is the number of infections that happened, therefore, time series models are fitted and the prediction is done based on the best-fitted model. Monitoring approaches may also be applied to time series models which could estimate the parameters more precisely. In epidemiological modeling, more biological parameters are incorporated in the models and the forecasting of the disease spread is carried out. We came up with, how to improve the existing modeling methods, the use of fuzzy variables, and detection of fraud in the available data. Ultimately, we have reviewed the results of recent statistical modeling efforts to predict the course of COVID-19 spread.	Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34353998	What is the role of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19? PURPOSE OF REVIEW: COVID-19 represents an unprecedented public health crisis caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The antiviral remdesivir is one component of treating COVID-19. Unfortunately, the trials evaluating remdesivir have reported mixed results, leading to uncertainty on when to use remdesivir. This review discusses the trials evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir for COVID-19 and other supporting data to help inform the role of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Since the start of the pandemic, there have been four randomized trials of remdesivir in treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Since then, more extensive observational studies have provided supportive data. SUMMARY: The majority of trials evaluating remdesivir suggest that remdesivir is effective in the treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Although there may be a benefit in some subgroups more than others, there is insufficient data to make definitive statements about benefits or lack of benefits in particular groups. Remdesivir has demonstrated clinical benefits such as decreased time in the hospital, lower progression to mechanical ventilation, and decreased utilization of other hospital resources; it is unclear if it reduces mortality, but one randomized controlled trial suggested possible survival benefits. Based on the data available, remdesivir has been approved (or authorized for early use) in 48 countries.	Treatment
34222054	Treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor at time of hospital admission for COVID-19 is not associated with improved clinical outcomes: data from the COVID-PREDICT cohort study in The Netherlands. Purpose: Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-)4 could reduce coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity by reducing inflammation and enhancing tissue repair beyond glucose lowering. We aimed to assess this in a prospective cohort study. Methods: We studied in 565 patients with type 2 diabetes in the CovidPredict Clinical Course Cohort whether use of a DPP-4 inhibitor prior to hospital admission due to COVID-19 was associated with improved clinical outcomes. Using crude analyses and propensity score matching (on age, sex and BMI), 28 patients using a DPP-4 inhibitor were identified and compared to non-users. Results: No differences were found in the primary outcome mortality (matched-analysis = odds-ratio: 0,94 [95% confidence interval: 0,69 - 1,28], p-value: 0,689) or any of the secondary outcomes (ICU admission, invasive ventilation, thrombotic events or infectious complications). Additional analyses comparing users of DPP-4 inhibitors with subgroups of non-users (subgroup 1: users of metformin and sulphonylurea; subgroup 2: users of any insulin combination), allowing to correct for diabetes severity, did not yield different results. Conclusions: We conclude that outpatient use of a DPP-4 inhibitor does not affect the clinical outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes who are hospitalized because of COVID-19 infection.	Treatment
34202160	Modulation of Viral Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting and Stop Codon Readthrough by the Host Restriction Factor Shiftless. The product of the interferon-stimulated gene C19orf66, Shiftless (SHFL), restricts human immunodeficiency virus replication through downregulation of the efficiency of the viral gag/pol frameshifting signal. In this study, we demonstrate that bacterially expressed, purified SHFL can decrease the efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting in vitro at a variety of sites, including the RNA pseudoknot-dependent signals of the coronaviruses IBV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the protein-dependent stimulators of the cardioviruses EMCV and TMEV. SHFL also reduced the efficiency of stop-codon readthrough at the murine leukemia virus gag/pol signal. Using size-exclusion chromatography, we confirm the binding of the purified protein to mammalian ribosomes in vitro. Finally, through electrophoretic mobility shift assays and mutational analysis, we show that expressed SHFL has strong RNA binding activity that is necessary for full activity in the inhibition of frameshifting, but shows no clear specificity for stimulatory RNA structures.

34286673	Functional binding dynamics relevant to the evolution of zoonotic spillovers in endemic and emergent Betacoronavirus strains. Comparative functional analysis of the dynamic interactions between various Betacoronavirus mutant strains and broadly utilized target proteins such as ACE2 and CD26, is crucial for a more complete understanding of zoonotic spillovers of viruses that cause diseases such as COVID-19. Here, we employ machine learning to replicated sets of nanosecond scale GPU accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to statistically compare and classify atom motions of these target proteins in both the presence and absence of different endemic and emergent strains of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S spike glycoprotein. A multi-agent classifier successfully identified functional binding dynamics that are evolutionarily conserved from bat CoV-HKU4 to human endemic/emergent strains. Conserved dynamics regions of ACE2 involve both the N-terminal helices, as well as a region of more transient dynamics encompassing residues K353, Q325 and a novel motif AAQPFLL 386-92 that appears to coordinate their dynamic interactions with the viral RBD at N501. We also demonstrate that the functional evolution of Betacoronavirus zoonotic spillovers involving ACE2 interaction dynamics are likely pre-adapted from two precise and stable binding sites involving the viral bat progenitor strain's interaction with CD26 at SAMLI 291-5 and SS 333-334. Our analyses further indicate that the human endemic strains hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-OC43 have evolved more stable N-terminal helix interactions through enhancement of an interfacing loop region on the viral RBD, whereas the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) have evolved more stable viral binding via more focused interactions between the viral N501 and ACE2 K353 alone.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

34292825	"Assessing Orthopedic Patient Preferences for Mandated Virtual Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Elective Virtual Care in Non-Pandemic Circumstances. The purpose of this study was to compare orthopedic patient preferences for mandated virtual care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and elective virtual care during non-pandemic circumstances. An orthopedic virtual care questionnaire was administered to adult orthopedic patients undergoing their first orthopedic virtual visit between March 15, 2020, and May 18, 2020. The questionnaire had 13 items rated on a 1-to-5 Likert scale (""strongly agree"" to ""strongly disagree""). Responses were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Patients showed higher preferences for mandated virtual care during the pandemic when compared with elective virtual care during non-pandemic circumstances (2.25+/-1.31 vs 4.10+/-1.25, P<.0001) and also preferred virtual visits in other specialties compared with orthopedics (2.17+/-1.35 vs 2.79+/-1.42, P<.0001). Patients older than 50 years were more likely to view virtual care as the best option during the pandemic (2.06+/-1.25 vs 2.48+/-1.35, P<.0165) and equally as effective as in-person visits in non-pandemic circumstances (2.45+/-1.36 vs 2.83+/-1.18, P<.0150). Female patients were more likely to pursue future orthopedic virtual visits (2.61+/-1.37 vs 3.07+/-1.45, P<.0203) and view their virtual visit as equally effective as an in-person visit (2.47+/-1.33 vs 2.87+/-1.18, P<.0181). Orthopedic patient preference for mandated virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be higher than for elective virtual care during non-pandemic circumstances, and older and female patients appear to favor virtual care.

34366171	Corona-regionalism? Differences in regional responses to COVID-19 in Italy. The paper discusses the responses to the COVID-19 crisis in the acute phase of the first wave of the pandemic (February-May 2020) by different Italian regions in Italy, which has a decentralised healthcare system. We consider five regions (Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Umbria, Apulia) which are located in the north, centre and south of Italy. These five regions differ both in their healthcare systems and in the extent to which they were hit by the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate their different responses to COVID-19 reflecting on seven management factors: (1) monitoring, (2) learning, (3) decision-making, (4) coordinating, (5) communicating, (6) leading, and (7) recovering capacity. In light of these factors, we discuss the analogies and differences among the regions and their different institutional choices.	Prevention
34334904	An analysis of mortality and survival of COVID 19 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Maharashtra, India. Background: After nine months of responding to the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, the scientific fraternity is yet to unravel the mystery of those who are at most risk from mortality. Despite resistance to wear masks, the global public health response has beaten the grimmer projections of millions of deaths. The present study seeks to analyze the survival of COVID-19 patients at a tertiary care hospital and identify the risk factors of mortality. Methods: Medical records of 1233 RT PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital between 01 April and 30 September 2020 were retrospectively analyzed for calculating overall survival and to investigate the independent predictors of survival of COVID-19 patients. Results: There were 72 (5.8%) deaths; which occurred in 24.9% of the elderly (age > 60yrs) people (P < 0.001), 76.0% in people with multiple comorbidities (having more than one comorbidity) (P < 0.001), 75.6% in people with diabetes (P < 0.001), and 75.5% in people with hypertension (P < 0.001). A significantly higher risk of mortality was observed in elderly patients, patients with comorbidities, and patients requiring oxygen while admitted in the hospital. Conclusion: Survival reflects the cure rates and is used by health professionals and policymakers to plan and implement disease control measures. The insights provided by the study would help facilitate the identification of patients at risk and timely provision of specialized care for the prevention of adverse outcomes in the hospital setting.

34379684	Combining IL-6 and SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia-based risk stratification for fatal outcomes of COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rapidly increases the use of mechanical ventilation (MV). Such cases further require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and have a high mortality. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify prognostic biomarkers pathophysiologically reflecting future deterioration of COVID-19. METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected from 102 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Interleukin (IL)-6 level and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA copy number in plasma were assessed with ELISA kit and quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Twelve patients died or required ECMO owing to acute respiratory distress syndrome despite the use of MV. Among various variables, a ratio of oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2), IL-6, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA on admission before intubation were strongly predictive of fatal outcomes after the MV use. Moreover, among these variables, combining SpO2/FiO2, IL-6, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed the highest accuracy (area under the curve: 0.934). In patients with low SpO2/FiO2 (< 261), fatal event-rate after the MV use at the 30-day was significantly higher in patients with high IL-6 (> 49 pg/mL) and SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia (> 1.5 copies/muL) compared to those with high IL-6 or RNAaemia or without high IL-6 and RNAaemia (88% vs. 22% or 8%, log-rank test P = 0.0097 or P < 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Combining SpO2/FiO2 with high IL-6 and SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia which reflect hyperinflammation and viral overload allows accurately and before intubation identifying COVID-19 patients at high risk for ECMO use or in-hospital death despite the use of MV.

34205086	The Impact of Post-COVID-19 Syndrome on Self-Reported Physical Activity. Background: A subgroup of patients recovering from COVID-19 experience persistent symptoms, decreased quality of life, increased dependency on others for personal care and impaired performance of activities of daily living. However, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on physical activity (PA) in this subgroup of patients with persistent symptoms remain unclear. Methods: Demographics, self-reported average time spent walking per week, as well as participation in activities pre-COVID-19 and after three and six months of follow-up were assessed in members of online long-COVID-19 peer support groups. Results: Two hundred thirty-nine patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were included (83% women, median (IQR) age: 50 (39-56) years). Patients reported a significantly decreased weekly walking time after three months of follow-up (three months: 60 (15-120) min. vs. pre-COVID-19: 120 (60-240) min./week; p < 0.05). Six months after the onset of symptoms walking time was still significantly lower compared to pre-COVID-19 but significantly increased compared to three months of follow-up (three months: 60 (15-120) min. vs. six months: 90 (30-150) min.; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Patients who experience persistent symptoms after COVID-19 may still demonstrate a significantly decreased walking time six months after the onset of symptoms. More research is needed to investigate long-term consequences and possible treatment options to guide patients during the recovery fromCOVID-19.	Prevention
34224515	COVID-19-Related Reduction in Emergency Health Care Utilization Among Febrile Pediatric Oncology Patients. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has disrupted normal health care utilization patterns worldwide, including decreasing emergency department (ED) visits for various medical emergencies. We examined whether this pattern was present in febrile pediatric oncology patients. In this single-center cohort study, we conducted a retrospective chart review of ED visits of febrile pediatric oncology patients during the first 4 months of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and compared those data to the same time periods in the previous 2 years. During the first 5 months of the pandemic, 25 pediatric oncology patients with fever visited our ED; 65 children visited during the same time period in 2018; and 60 visited in 2019. Compared with 2018 and 2019, encounters for 2020 were decreased by 62% and 58%, respectively. A significantly higher percentage of febrile pediatric oncology patients (84%) were admitted to our hospital during the pandemic compared the previous years (58%). Of concern is the possibility that fear of exposure to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) at our health care facility prompted caregivers of pediatric oncology patients to avoid seeking care for their child with fever. Consistent communication with families about the life-threatening nature of fever should be prioritized among pediatric oncology providers.	Prevention
34204501	Immune Response to Vaccination against COVID-19 in Breastfeeding Health Workers. BACKGROUND: Initially, there were no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in lactating women. The aim of our study was to evaluate the immune response to COVID-19 vaccinations in breastfeeding women. METHODS: The study included 32 breastfeeding women who, regardless of the study, had decided to be vaccinated. Maternal serum and breast milk samples were simultaneously collected on days 8 +/- 1, 22 +/- 2, 29 +/- 3, and 43 +/- 4 after the first dose of the vaccine. The immune response was assessed by determining the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA. RESULTS: The breast milk IgG level was detectable (6.50 +/- 6.74, median 4.7, and maximum 34.2 BAU/mL) and highly correlated to serum IgG level (rS 0.89; p < 0.001). The breast milk ratio of IgA to the cut-off value was higher in serum IgA-positive (4.18 +/- 3.26, median 2.8, and maximum >10) than in serum IgA-negative women (0.56 +/- 0.37, median 0.5, and maximum 1.6; p < 0.001). The highest concentrations of serum and breast milk antibodies were observed on day 29 +/- 3 with a decrease on day 43 +/- 4. CONCLUSION: The immune response to the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is strongest 7 +/- 3 days after the second dose of the vaccine. Lactating mothers breastfeeding their children after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 may transfer antibodies to their infant.	Treatment;Mechanism;Diagnosis;Transmission
34212748	Clinical outcomes of hospitalised COVID-19 patients at Mthatha Regional Hospital, Eastern Cape, South Africa: A retrospective study. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health crisis that threatens the current health system. The sudden expansion in the need for inpatient and intensive care facilities raised concerns about optimal clinical management and resource allocation. Despite the pressing need for evidence to make context-specific decisions on COVID-19 management, evidence from South Africa remained limited. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalised patients. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study design was used to evaluate the clinical outcomes of hospitalised adult patients (>/= 18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness at Mthatha Regional Hospital (MRH), Eastern Cape. RESULTS: Of the 1814 patients tested for COVID-19 between 20 March 2020 and 31 July 2020 at MRH, two-thirds (65.4%) were female. About two-thirds (242) of the 392 patients (21.6%) who tested positive for this disease were hospitalised and one-third (150) were quarantined at home. The mean age of the patients tested for COVID-19 was 42.6 years and there was no difference between males and females. The mean age of hospitalised patients was 55.5 years and the mean age of hospitalised patients who died (61.3 years) was much higher than recovered (49.5 years). Overall, 188 (77.6%) hospitalised patients had clinical comorbidity on admission. Diabetes (36.8%) and hypertension (33.1%) were the most common comorbidities amongst COVID-19 hospitalised patients. CONCLUSION: The majority of the patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 were elderly and had high baseline comorbidities. Advance age and underlying comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension and HIV) were associated with high mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34293534	A French survey on the lockdown consequences of COVID-19 pandemic in Parkinson's disease. The ERCOPARK study. BACKGROUND: In 2020 the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic imposed a total and sudden lockdown. We aimed to investigate the consequences of the first COVID-19 lockdown (mid-March - mid-April 2020) on motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS) in a cohort of French people with Parkinson's disease (PwP). METHODS: PwP were enrolled either by an on-line survey sent from the national France Parkinson association (FP) to reach the French community of PwP or as part of outpatients' telemedicine visits followed by an hospital-based Parkinson Expert Center (PEC). All patients were evaluated using the same standardized questionnaire assessing motor and NMS (including a list of most disabling, new or worsened symptoms and Patient's Global Impression-Improvement scales [PGI-I]) psycho-social queries and quality of life. RESULTS: 2653 PwP were included: 441 (16.6%) in the PEC group and 2122 (83.4%) in the community-based group. Physiotherapy was interrupted among 88.6% of the patients. 40.9% referred a clinical modification of their symptoms. Based on the questionnaire, pain (9.3%), rigidity (9.1%) and tremor (8.5%) were the three most frequently new or worsened reported symptoms. Based on the PGI-I, the motor symptoms were the most affected domain, followed by pain and psychic state. PwP in community-based group tended to have more frequent worsening for motor symptoms, motor complications, pain and confusion than those of the PEC group. CONCLUSIONS: The first COVID-19 lockdown had a negative impact on motor and NMS of PwP. Efforts should be allocated to avoid interruption of care, including physiotherapy and physical activities and implement telemedicine. .	Prevention
34219482	The impact of COVID-19 related national lockdown on ophthalmic emergency in Italy: A multicenter study. PURPOSE: To assess ocular pathologies admitted to Italian Emergency Eye Departments (EEDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic national lockdown in 2020 in comparison with the same period in 2019. METHODS: Electronic records of all patients presenting at EEDs of two tertiary-care Eye Centers during the COVID-19 national lockdown in Italy (March 10-May 3, 2020) were compared with the equivalent period in 2019. Main outcomes were patient age, gender, and diagnoses. Statistical analysis included unpaired Student t-tests, Poisson regression, and chi-square test. RESULTS: Overall EED visits significantly decreased by 54.1% during the 2020 lockdown compared to 2019 (851 vs 1854, p < 0.001). During lockdown, patients showed comparable mean age (52.8 years in 2020 vs 53.3 years in 2019, p = 0.52) and significant male gender bias (61.1% in 2020 vs 55.8% in 2019, p < 0.0001). The most frequent pathologies were eye inflammations, trauma-related incidents, and spontaneous acute vitreous detachment. Patients with inflammation, headache/hemicrania, and spontaneous subconjunctival hemorrhages were significantly less, whereas those with trauma-related diagnoses were significantly higher during the lockdown as compared with 2019 (p < 0.05). The proportion of non-urgent visits decreased from 17% in 2019 to 8% in 2020 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During the 2020 lockdown, there was a significant reduction of accesses to EED, especially for non-urgent pathologies. Potentially visual function threatening conditions, such as trauma-related pathologies, retinal detachment or ruptures, and wet AMD, showed lower number of cases but higher or stable proportion relative to the total caseload, suggesting a correct and efficient access to ophthalmic health care during the pandemic period.

34293683	Acute autoimmune-like hepatitis with atypical anti-mitochondrial antibody after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination: A novel clinical entity? Autoimmune phenomena and clinically apparent autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis, are increasingly been reported not only after natural infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but also after vaccination against it. We report the case of a 63-year old man without a history of autoimmunity or SARS-CoV-2 natural infection who experienced acute severe autoimmune-like hepatitis seven days after the first dose of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Liver histology showed inflammatory portal infiltrate with interface hepatitis, lobular and centrilobular inflammation with centrilobular necrosis, in absence of fibrosis and steatosis. Serum immunoglobulin G was slightly elevated. Autoimmune liver serology showed an indirect immunofluorescence pattern on triple rodent tissue compatible with anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), but, unexpectedly, this pattern was not mirrored by positivity for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)-specific molecular tests, indicating that this antibody is different from classical AMA. Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) was also positive with a rim-like indirect immunofluorescence pattern on liver and HEp2 cell substrates, similar to PBC-specific ANA; however, anti-gp210 and a large panel of molecular-based assays for nuclear antigens were negative, suggesting a unique ANA in our patient. He carries the HLA DRB1*11:01 allele, which is protective against PBC. Response to prednisone treatment was satisfactory. The clinical significance of these novel specificities needs to be further evaluated in this emerging condition.	Case Report
34285032	COVID-19 complicated by immune thrombocytopaenic purpura and internal jugular vein thrombosis. A 61-year-old woman who had tested positive for COVID-19 in the community 5 days prior to admission presented with new onset severe headache and mild shortness of breath. She had an acute reduction in her platelet counts from 153x10(9)/L to 5x10(9)/L. She was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia purpura and after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, her platelet count increased to 15x10(9)/L. Due to nonresolving headache, she had a magnetic resonance venogram, which showed bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis. She was discharged from hospital and followed up in Haematology and Neurology clinics. Her platelet count returned to normal range 7 days later. She was commenced on anticoagulation for thrombosis.

34348116	Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the household setting: a prospective cohort study in children and adults in England. OBJECTIVES: To measure secondary attack rates (SARs) in prospectively followed household contacts of paediatric and adult cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England. METHODS: Self-taken nasal swabs from household contacts of PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19 and blood samples on day 35 were tested for evidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus. RESULTS: The secondary attack rate (SAR) among 431 contacts of 172 symptomatic index cases was 33% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 25-40) and was lower from primary cases without respiratory symptoms, 6% (CI 0-14) vs 37% (CI 29-45), p=0.030. The SAR from index cases <11 years was 25% (CI 12-38). SARs ranged from 16% (4-28) in contacts <11 years old to 36% (CI 28-45) in contacts aged 19-54 years (p=0.119). The proportion infected who developed symptoms (78%) was similar by age (p=0.44) though <19 year olds had fewer mean number of symptoms than adults (p=0.001) and fewer reported loss of sense of taste or smell (p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There are high risks of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the home, including those where infection is introduced by a child. The risk of children acquiring infection was lower than that in adults and fewer developed typical symptoms of Covid-19 infection.	Transmission
34344028	[New developments and perspectives in acromegaly]. Acromegaly is a rare but severe disorder which is usually due to an excessive secretion of growth hormone (GH) by a pituitary adenoma. Screening mainly relies on the measurement of insulin-like growth factor 1, and confirmatory diagnostics includes a GH suppression test. As delayed diagnosis results in increased morbidity and mortality, we here discuss recently published suggestions regarding the biochemical work-up of suspected cases and the follow-up of co-morbidities. Moreover, new analytical tools (such as automatic identification of typical facial changes using artificial intelligence) are presented, hopefully allowing for an earlier diagnosis in the future. So far, surgery is still regarded as therapy of first choice. In cases without postoperative remission, a new imaging approach (combining sellar magnetic resonance imaging and position emission tomography) may improve the results of repeated surgery. The pharmaceutical arsenal now includes the first orally available somatostatin analogue, and recent data on possible drug combinations and the outcome of radiotherapy are presented. Finally, special attention is paid to older and pregnant patients, as well as certain considerations during the COVID-19 pandemic (where appropriate diagnosis and management of acromegaly is particularly challenging).

34332998	The challenge of screening SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with RT-qPCR: One variant can hide another. INTRODUCTION: Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) worldwide, it is important to monitor local epidemiology to better understand the occurrence of clusters, reinfections, or infection after vaccination. Detecting mutations by specific RT-qPCR is a rapid and affordable alternative to sequencing. However, care must be taken to ensure that the techniques used are up-to-date and adapted to the variants circulating in the studied population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were screened for detection of mutations of the spike protein using the Novaplex SARS-CoV-2 Variants I Assay from week 11 of 2021. Target sought were deletion H69/V70 and mutations N501Y and E484 K. From week 18 we used in addition the new Novaplex SARS-CoV-2 Variants II Assay for samples with no targets found with the Variants I assay or with the mutation E484 K alone, in order to screen the mutations L452R, K417 N/T and W152C. RESULTS: Between weeks 11 and 25, 2239 positive samples out of 54,317 were tested with the Variants I Assay. Between weeks 18 and 25, 94 samples met the criteria for being tested with the Variants II Assay. Of these, 47 had the L452R mutation without the W152C mutation, typical in the B.1.617 variant. At week 25, this profile was found in 45.5 % of the samples and was the most frequent. CONCLUSION: According to our observations, variant B.1.617 has become predominant in our institution and most probably in our region. In the absence of the use of the Variants II Assay, they would have been considered wild.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
34201587	Identification of SARS-CoV-2 E Channel Blockers from a Repurposed Drug Library. SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, is a member of the Coronaviridae family. It is an enveloped virus with ion channels in its membrane, the most characterized of which is the E protein. Therefore, in an attempt to identify blockers of the E channel, we screened a library of 2839 approved-for-human-use drugs. Our approach yielded eight compounds that exhibited appreciable activity in three bacteria-based channel assays. Considering the fact that the E channel is the most conserved of all SARS-CoV-2 proteins, any inhibitor of its activity may provide an option to curb the viral spread. In addition, inhibitors can also enhance our ability to understand the exact role played by the E protein during the infectivity cycle. Finally, detailed electrophysiological analyses, alongside in vitro and in vivo studies will be needed to establish the exact potential of each of the blockers identified in our study.

34291225	Natriuretic Peptide Levels and Clinical Outcomes Among Patients Hospitalized With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection. OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence of cardiovascular morbidity associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019). Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide is a biomarker of myocardial stress, associated with various respiratory and cardiac outcomes. We hypothesized that pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level would be associated with mortality and clinical outcomes in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients. DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis using adjusted logistic and linear regression to assess the association of admission pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (analyzed by both cutoff > 125 pg/mL and log transformed pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) with clinical outcomes. We additionally treated body mass index, a confounder of both pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels and coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes, as an ordinal variable. SETTING: We reviewed hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who had a pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level measured within 48 hours of admission between March 1, and August 31, 2020, from a multihospital U.S. health system. PATIENTS: Adult patients (>/= 18 yr old; n = 1232) with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to the health system. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and troponin I level, higher pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level was significantly associated with death and secondary outcomes of new heart failure, length of stay, ICU duration, and need for ventilation among hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients. This significance persisted after adjustment for body mass index as an ordinal variable. The adjusted hazard ratio of death for log transformed pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.23-1.97; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Further investigation is warranted on the utility of pro-B-type natriuretic peptide for clinical prognostication in coronavirus disease 2019 as well as implications of abnormal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in the underlying pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019-related myocardial injury.

34372565	"Variant Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Genomes from Belgian Military Personnel Engaged in Overseas Missions and Operations. More than a year after the first identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China, the emergence and spread of genomic variants of this virus through travel raise concerns regarding the introduction of lineages in previously unaffected regions, requiring adequate containment strategies. Concomitantly, such introductions fuel worries about a possible increase in transmissibility and disease severity, as well as a possible decrease in vaccine efficacy. Military personnel are frequently deployed on missions around the world. As part of a COVID-19 risk mitigation strategy, Belgian Armed Forces that engaged in missions and operations abroad were screened (7683 RT-qPCR tests), pre- and post-mission, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, including the identification of viral lineages. Nine distinct viral genotypes were identified in soldiers returning from operations in Niger, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, and Mali. The SARS-CoV-2 variants belonged to major clades 19B, 20A, and 20B (Nextstrain nomenclature), and included ""variant of interest"" B.1.525, ""variant under monitoring"" A.27, as well as lineages B.1.214, B.1, B.1.1.254, and A (pangolin nomenclature), some of which are internationally monitored due to the specific mutations they harbor. Through contact tracing and phylogenetic analysis, we show that isolation and testing policies implemented by the Belgian military command appear to have been successful in containing the influx and transmission of these distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants into military and civilian populations."

34218752	The Use of Telehealth to Provide Continuity of Cancer Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Advantages, Disparities, and Implications to Promote Health Equity. Perceptions of oncology health care providers use of telehealth to provide care to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic were explored. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and purposive sampling (N = 30) was conducted. Four themes emerged: 1) telehealth provided continuity of cancer care and used to decrease the risk of COVID-19 exposure; 2) advantages brought about convenience and inclusion of family caregivers; 3) telehealth revealed geographic, aging, and racial/ethnic disparities and digital illiteracy; and 4) rapid implementation was challenging. Telehealth provides a number of opportunities to support care for vulnerable cancer patients during this health crisis; however, disparities must be addressed.	Prevention
34280974	"Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Detection by Rapid Antigen and by Three Commercial RT-qPCR Tests: A Study from Martin University Hospital in Slovakia. The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is having a tremendous impact on the global economy, health care systems and the lives of almost all people in the world. The Central European country of Slovakia reached one of the highest daily mortality rates per 100,000 inhabitants in the first 3 months of 2021, despite implementing strong prophylactic measures, lockdowns and repeated nationwide antigen testing. The present study reports a comparison of the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 antigen test (SD Biosensor) with three commercial RT-qPCR kits (vDetect COVID-19-MultiplexDX, gb SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex-GENERI BIOTECH Ltd. and Genvinset COVID-19 [E]-BDR Diagnostics) in the detection of infected individuals among employees of the Martin University Hospital in Slovakia. Health care providers, such as doctors and nurses, are classified as ""critical infrastructure"", and there is no doubt about the huge impact that incorrect results could have on patients. Out of 1231 samples, 14 were evaluated as positive for SARS-CoV-2 antigen presence, and all of them were confirmed by RT-qPCR kit 1 and kit 2. As another 26 samples had a signal in the E gene, these 40 samples were re-isolated and subsequently re-analysed using the three kits, which detected the virus in 22, 23 and 12 cases, respectively. The results point to a divergence not only between antigen and RT-qPCR tests, but also within the ""gold standard"" RT-qPCR testing. Performance analysis of the diagnostic antigen test showed the positive predictive value (PPV) to be 100% and negative predictive value (NPV) to be 98.10%, indicating that 1.90% of individuals with a negative result were, in fact, positive. If these data are extrapolated to the national level, where the mean daily number of antigen tests was 250,000 in April 2021, it points to over 4700 people per day being misinterpreted and posing a risk of virus shedding. While mean Ct values of the samples that were both antigen and RT-qPCR positive were about 20 (kit 1: 20.47 and 20.16 for Sarbeco&nbsp;E and RdRP, kit 2: 19.37 and 19.99 for Sarbeco&nbsp;E and RdRP and kit 3: 17.47 for ORF1b/RdRP), mean Ct values of the samples that were antigen-negative but RT-qPCR-positive were about 30 (kit 1: 30.67 and 30.00 for Sarbeco&nbsp;E and RdRP, kit 2: 29.86 and 31.01 for Sarbeco&nbsp;E and RdRP and kit 3: 27.47 for ORF1b/RdRP). It confirms the advantage of antigen test in detecting the most infectious individuals with a higher viral load. However, the reporting of Ct values is still a matter of ongoing debates and should not be conducted without normalisation to standardised controls of known concentration."	Diagnosis
34222663	T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and conserved surface protein of Plasmodium malariae share sequence homology. Since its emergence in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading remarkably fast worldwide. Effective countermeasures require the rapid development of data and tools to monitor its spread and better understand immunogenic profile. However, limited information is available about the tools and target of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we excogitated a new approach for analyzing phylogenetic relationships by using the whole prototype proteome sequences. Phylogenetic analysis on the whole prototype proteome sequences showed that SARS-CoV-2 was a direct descendant of Bat-CoV and was closely related to Pangolin-CoV, Bat-SL-CoV, and SARS-CoV. The pairwise comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with Bat-CoV showed an unusual replacement of the motif consisting of seven amino acids (NNLDSKV) within the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The replaced motif in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was found in 12 other species, including a conserved surface protein of a malaria-causing pathogen, Plasmodium malariae. We further identified the T and B cell epitope sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with conserved surface protein of P. malariae using the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB). The shared immunodominant epitopes may provide immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection to those previously infected with P. malariae.	Mechanism

34287986	Identification of novel inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro) ) from Withania sp. by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. Since December 2019, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has claimed the lives of millions of people across the globe. To date, no medicine is available for the responsible virus SARS-CoV-2. 3CLpro, that is, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, the main protease (M(pro) ), has an important role in cleaving pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins. This M(pro) serves as an important target in drug designing against COVID-19. Herein, the study includes the investigation, screening, and identification of potent leads from (Withania sps.), against SARS-CoV-2, using virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Seventy-three natural compounds from this important medicinal plant were screened. The Binding affinity was used to identify the most probable target to inhibit the M(pro) , compounds 27-hydroxywithanolide F (W32, -11.5 kcal/mol), withanolide A (W56, -11.4 kcal/mol), and withacoagulin H (W30, -11.1 kcal/mol) showed highest binding energy. Lipinski's rule, followed by drug-likability and likeness screening, resulted in 36 molecules. Further, MD simulation of 50 ns predicted withacoagulin H possessing strong binding affinity and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the active site. The binding free energy calculation showed the most negative energy of withacoagulin H (-63.463 KJ/mol) compared to other selected compounds. The study also compared the bonding energy of already reported repurposed and newly synthesized drugs. Further, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion predictions were made to found a good balance of potency. Hence the following screened compounds from Withania sps. could serve as the potential leads for drug development against COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34200055	Protective Action of L. salivarius SGL03 and Lactoferrin against COVID-19 Infections in Human Nasopharynx. In this study, we used live viral particles from oral secretions from 17 people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and from 17 healthy volunteers, which were plated on a suitable medium complete for all microorganisms and minimal for L.salivarius growth. Both types of media also contained an appropriately prepared vector system pGEM-5Zf (+) based on the lactose operon (beta-galactosidase system). Incubation was carried out on both types of media for 24 h with the addition of 200 muL of Salistat SGL03 solution in order to test its inhibitory effect on the coronavirus contained in the oral mucosa and nasopharynx, visible as light blue virus particles on the test plates, which gradually disappeared in the material collected from infected persons over time. Regardless of the conducted experiments, swabs were additionally taken from the nasopharynx of infected and healthy people after rinsing the throat and oral mucosa with Salistat SGL03. In both types of experiments, after 24 h of incubation on appropriate media with biological material, we did not find any virus particles. Results were also confirmed by MIC and MBC tests. Results prove that lactoferrin, as one of the ingredients of the preparation, is probably a factor that blocks the attachment of virus particles to the host cells, determining its anti-viral properties. The conducted preliminary experiments constitute a very promising model for further research on the anti-viral properties of the ingredients contained in the Salistat SGL03 dietary supplement.

34207876	Altered Vascular Endothelium-Dependent Responsiveness in Frail Elderly Patients Recovering from COVID-19 Pneumonia: Preliminary Evidence. We evaluated vascular dysfunction with the single passive leg movement test (sPLM) in 22 frail elderly patients at 84 + 31 days after hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia, compared to 22 age-, sex- and comorbidity-matched controls (CTRL). At rest, all COVID-19 patients were in stable clinical condition without severe comorbidities. Patients (aged 72 +/- 6 years, 73% male) had moderate disability (Barthel index score 77 +/- 26), hypoxemia and normocapnia at arterial blood gas analysis and mild pulmonary restriction at spirometry. Values of circulating markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein: CRP; erythrocyte sedimentation rate: ESR) and coagulation (D-dimer) were: 27.13 +/- 37.52 mg/dL, 64.24 +/- 32.37 mm/1 h and 1043 +/- 729 ng/mL, respectively. At rest, femoral artery diameter was similar in COVID-19 and CTRL (p = 0.16). On the contrary, COVID-19 infection deeply impacted blood velocity (p = 0.001) and femoral blood flow (p < 0.0001). After sPLM, peak femoral blood flow was dramatically reduced in COVID-19 compared to CTRL (p = 0.001), as was blood flow peak (p = 0.05) and the area under the curve (p < 0.0001). This altered vascular responsiveness could be one of the unknown components of long COVID-19 syndrome leading to fatigue, changes in muscle metabolism and fibers' composition, exercise intolerance and increased cardiovascular risk. Impact of specific treatments, such as exercise training, dietary supplements or drugs, should be evaluated.	Treatment;Mechanism;Diagnosis
34206965	COVID-19 Lockdowns May Reduce Resistance Genes Diversity in the Human Microbiome and the Need for Antibiotics. Recently, much attention has been paid to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet bacterial resistance to antibiotics remains a serious and unresolved public health problem that kills hundreds of thousands of people annually, being an insidious and silent pandemic. To contain the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, populations confined and tightened hygiene measures. We performed this study with computer simulations and by using mobility data of mobile phones from Google in the region of Lisbon, Portugal, comprising 3.7 million people during two different lockdown periods, scenarios of 40 and 60% mobility reduction. In the simulations, we assumed that the network of physical contact between people is that of a small world and computed the antibiotic resistance in human microbiomes after 180 days in the simulation. Our simulations show that reducing human contacts drives a reduction in the diversity of antibiotic resistance genes in human microbiomes. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's pairwise tests show very strong evidence (p < 0.000, adjusted using the Bonferroni correction) of a difference between the four confinement regimes. The proportion of variability in the ranked dependent variable accounted for by the confinement variable was eta(2) = 0.148, indicating a large effect of confinement on the diversity of antibiotic resistance. We have shown that confinement and hygienic measures, in addition to reducing the spread of pathogenic bacteria in a human network, also reduce resistance and the need to use antibiotics.	Prevention
34209659	Potential In Vitro Inhibition of Selected Plant Extracts against SARS-CoV-2 Chymotripsin-Like Protease (3CL(Pro)) Activity. Antiviral treatments inhibiting Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication may represent a strategy complementary to vaccination to fight the ongoing Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Molecules or extracts inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 chymotripsin-like protease (3CL(Pro)) could contribute to reducing or suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Using a targeted approach, we identified 17 plant products that are included in current and traditional cuisines as promising inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(Pro) activity. Methanolic extracts were evaluated in vitro for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(Pro) activity using a quenched fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. Extracts from turmeric (Curcuma longa) rhizomes, mustard (Brassica nigra) seeds, and wall rocket (Diplotaxis erucoides subsp. erucoides) at 500 microg mL(-1) displayed significant inhibition of the 3CL(Pro) activity, resulting in residual protease activities of 0.0%, 9.4%, and 14.9%, respectively. Using different extract concentrations, an IC50 value of 15.74 microg mL(-1) was calculated for turmeric extract. Commercial curcumin inhibited the 3CL(Pro) activity, but did not fully account for the inhibitory effect of turmeric rhizomes extracts, suggesting that other components of the turmeric extract must also play a main role in inhibiting the 3CL(Pro) activity. Sinigrin, a major glucosinolate present in mustard seeds and wall rocket, did not have relevant 3CL(Pro) inhibitory activity; however, its hydrolysis product allyl isothiocyanate had an IC50 value of 41.43 microg mL(-1). The current study identifies plant extracts and molecules that can be of interest in the search for treatments against COVID-19, acting as a basis for future chemical, in vivo, and clinical trials.

34221202	Impact of Covid-19 containment on community pharmaceutical spending in Andalusia - Spain. Background: In the field of health, the year 2020 will be remembered for testing (stressing) all health institutions and their forms of management (centralised and decentralised). The everyday activity of primary and hospital care was significantly altered by the introduction of telephone consultations, which reduce the number of visits to health centres or hospitals and are still relevant today in the face of successive waves of the pandemic. Objective: To analyse whether population confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the dispensing of medications in community pharmacies and the associated spending during the period March-July 2020 in Andalusia (Spain). Methods: A time series analysis applying econometric model analysis techniques to confirm or rule out whether the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the dispensing of medications by community pharmacies and the associated expenditures. The variables used were the number of medication containers dispensed by community pharmacies (charged to the public funds of the Spanish National Health System) and the expenditure on prescription drugs, both in relation to the population. The analysis was performed within the region of Andalusia, which has 8,464,441 inhabitants. Results: The data obtained from the time series confirmed that there were no significant differences during the studied period between the number of medication containers actually dispensed and the number that would have been expected to be dispensed according to the trend in this variable for the sample period. The expenditure results followed the same pattern. Conclusions: The health crisis produced by the COVID-19 lockdown had no impact on medication consumption in Andalusia.	Prevention
34292118	Characteristics, clinical outcomes, and risk factors of SARS-COV-2 infection in adult acute myeloid leukemia patients: experience of the PETHEMA group. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection produces higher morbidity and mortality in hematological malignancies, but evidence in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is scarce. A multicenter observational study was conducted to determine the clinical outcomes and assess the impact of therapeutic approaches in adult AML patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first wave (March-May 2020). Overall, 108 patients were included: 51.9% with active leukemia and 70.4% under therapeutic schedules for AML. Signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 were present in 96.3% of patients and 82.4% received specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2. The mortality rate was 43.5% and was correlated with age, gender, active leukemia, dyspnea, severe SARS-CoV-2, intensive care measures, neutrophil count, and D-dimer levels. A protective effect was found with azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and normal liver enzyme levels. During the SARS-CoV-2 first wave, our findings suggested an increased mortality in AML in a short period. SARS-CoV-2 management could be guided by risk factors in AML patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34289966	Diagnostic yield of bacteriological tests and predictors of severe outcome in adult patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department. BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend maximal efforts to obtain blood and sputum cultures in patients with COVID-19, as bacterial coinfection is associated with worse outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield of bacteriological tests, including blood and sputum cultures, and the association of multiple biomarkers and the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) with clinical and microbiological outcomes in patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This is a substudy of a large observational cohort study (PredictED study). The PredictED included adult patients from whom a blood culture was drawn at the ED of Haga Teaching Hospital, The Netherlands. For this substudy, all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in March and April 2020 were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of bacterial coinfection. We used logistic regression analysis for associations of procalcitonin, C reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lymphocyte count and PSI score with a severe disease course, defined as intensive care unit admission and/or 30-day mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) quantified the discriminatory performance. RESULTS: We included 142 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. On presentation, the median duration of symptoms was 8 days. 41 (29%) patients had a severe disease course and 24 (17%) died within 30 days. The incidence of bacterial coinfection was 2/142 (1.4%). None of the blood cultures showed pathogen growth while 6.3% was contaminated. The AUCs for predicting severe disease were 0.76 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.84), 0.70 (0.61 to 0.79), 0.62 (0.51 to 0.74), 0.62 (0.51 to 0.72) and 0.72 (0.63 to 0.81) for procalcitonin, CRP, ferritin, lymphocyte count and PSI score, respectively. CONCLUSION: Blood cultures appear to have limited value while procalcitonin and the PSI appear to be promising tools in helping physicians identify patients at risk for severe disease course in COVID-19 at presentation to the ED.

34211742	Investigation of the Epidemiological Situation and the Incidence of Covid 19 Disease in an Area of Markazi Province in Iran Country. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus is an emerging virus that has caused many casualties. Therefore, the purpose of this descriptive study is to investigate the epidemiological situation of coronavirus in Khomein city in the province of Markazi in Iran. METHOD: This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on all people with coronavirus disease from the first date of admission of positive PCR of patients with coronavirus until 21 September 2020. Information on the records of definitively discharged and deceased patients due to coronavirus (having positive PCR) was extracted from 20/2/2020 to 21/9/2020 and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, area of residence, occupation, and past medical history were assessed for each patient with coronavirus disease. RESULTS: The range of age of this study was from 2 months to 95 years old and their mean age was 52.9+/-19.2 years old. The mean age of men and women in this study was 52.36 and 53.84 years old, respectively, which showed no significant relationship (T=0.966, N=691, P-Value=0.335, df=689). 52.1% of deaths were in rural areas and 47.9% were in urban areas. CONCLUSION: With observing the protocols by the people as well as traffic restrictions and social distance, we gradually experienced a decreasing trend in positive coronavirus cases and hospitalization cases. Then, due to the decrease in people's sensitivity and false confidence, the second outbreak of the disease began again and reached its peak in May and July.	Prevention
34226851	Identifying factors associated with the issuance of coronavirus-related stay-at-home orders in the Middle East and North Africa Region. The COVID-19 pandemic has not spared the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region. MENA is one of the most politically, socially, and economically heterogeneous regions in the world, a characteristic reflected in its governments' responses to COVID-19. About two-thirds of these governments issued coronavirus-related stay-at-home orders (SAHOs), one of the most effective tools public health officials have for slowing the spread of infectious diseases. While SAHOs are very effective in terms of countering infectious diseases, they are extremely disruptive in nonhealth domains. The objective of this study is to identify reliable factors related to health care policy making that shaped the decisions of MENA governments to issue a SAHO or not in response to COVID-19. The results identify specific political, social, and medical factors that played important roles and provide a look at early government responses to a global health crisis in a heterogeneous region of the world.

34289534	High-resolution HLA genotyping identifies alleles associated with severe COVID-19: A preliminary study from India. INTRODUCTION: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variability has been demonstrated to be associated with susceptibility/severity of COVID-19. High-resolution HLA genotyping to identify alleles associated with severe COVID-19 in an Indian cohort was performed. METHODS: Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with mild/moderate/severe disease (n = 54) and asymptomatic (n = 42) were recruited and genotyped for 11-HLA loci on MiSeq using NGSgo(R)-MX11-3 and analyzed (NGSengine; GenDx). RESULTS: A significant difference in alleles between the groups was identified for HLA-C*04:01:01:01, HLA-DRB5*01:01:01:02, HLA-DQA1*03:01:01:01, HLA-DPB1*04:01:01:41, and HLA-DPA1*01:03:01:02. Alleles namely, HLA-C*04:01:01:01 (OR: 5.71; 95% CI: 1.2-27.14; p = .02), HLA-DRB5*01:01:01:02 (OR: 2.94; 95% CI: 1.1-7.84; p = .03), DQA1*03:01:01:01 (OR: 22.47; 95% CI: 1.28-393.5; p = .03), HLA-DPB1*04:01:01:41 (OR: 9.44; 95% CI: 0.5-175.81; p = .13), and HLA-DPA1*01:03:01:02 (OR: 8.27; 95% CI: 2.26-30.21; p = .001) were associated with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Genotyping for these alleles will enable identification of individuals at risk of severe disease and stratification for preferential vaccination.	Mechanism;Diagnosis;Treatment
34216472	An observational cohort study on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and B.1.1.7 variant infection in healthcare workers by antibody and vaccination status. BACKGROUND: Natural and vaccine-induced immunity will play a key role in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 variants have the potential to evade natural and vaccine-induced immunity. METHODS: In a longitudinal cohort study of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Oxfordshire, UK, we investigated the protection from symptomatic and asymptomatic PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection conferred by vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2, Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCOV-19) and prior infection (determined using anti-spike antibody status), using Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex, temporal changes in incidence and role. We estimated protection conferred after one versus two vaccinations and from infections with the B.1.1.7 variant identified using whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: 13,109 HCWs participated; 8285 received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (1407 two doses) and 2738 the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (49 two doses). Compared to unvaccinated seronegative HCWs, natural immunity and two vaccination doses provided similar protection against symptomatic infection: no HCW vaccinated twice had symptomatic infection, and incidence was 98% lower in seropositive HCWs (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.02 [95%CI <0.01-0.18]). Two vaccine doses or seropositivity reduced the incidence of any PCR-positive result with or without symptoms by 90% (0.10 [0.02-0.38]) and 85% (0.15 [0.08-0.26]) respectively. Single-dose vaccination reduced the incidence of symptomatic infection by 67% (0.33 [0.21-0.52]) and any PCR-positive result by 64% (0.36 [0.26-0.50]). There was no evidence of differences in immunity induced by natural infection and vaccination for infections with S-gene target failure and B.1.1.7. CONCLUSION: Natural infection resulting in detectable anti-spike antibodies and two vaccine doses both provide robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including against the B.1.1.7 variant.

34207313	"Natural Products, Alone or in Combination with FDA-Approved Drugs, to Treat COVID-19 and Lung Cancer. As a public health emergency of international concern, the highly contagious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been identified as a severe threat to the lives of billions of individuals. Lung cancer, a malignant tumor with the highest mortality rate, has brought significant challenges to both human health and economic development. Natural products may play a pivotal role in treating lung diseases. We reviewed published studies relating to natural products, used alone or in combination with US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, active against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and lung cancer from 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2021. A wide range of natural products can be considered promising anti-COVID-19 or anti-lung cancer agents have gained widespread attention, including natural products as monotherapy for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (ginkgolic acid, shiraiachrome A, resveratrol, and baicalein) or lung cancer (daurisoline, graveospene A, deguelin, and erianin) or in combination with FDA-approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents (cepharanthine plus nelfinavir, linoleic acid plus remdesivir) and anti-lung cancer agents (curcumin and cisplatin, celastrol and gefitinib). Natural products have demonstrated potential value and with the assistance of nanotechnology, combination drug therapies, and the codrug strategy, this ""natural remedy"" could serve as a starting point for further drug development in treating these lung diseases."

34220706	COVID-19 and Diabetes: Understanding the Interrelationship and Risks for a Severe Course. The relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus is complicated and bidirectional. On the one hand, diabetes mellitus is considered one of the most important risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. Several factors that are often present in diabetes mellitus are likely to contribute to this risk, such as older age, a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state, hyperglycemia and underlying comorbidities (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and obesity). On the other hand, a severe COVID-19 infection, and its treatment with steroids, can have a specific negative impact on diabetes itself, leading to worsening of hyperglycemia through increased insulin resistance and reduced beta-cell secretory function. Worsening hyperglycemia can, in turn, adversely affect the course of COVID-19. Although more knowledge gradually surfaces as the pandemic progresses, challenges in understanding the interrelationship between COVID-19 and diabetes remain.	Mechanism;Treatment
34209064	Antimicrobial Peptides and Physical Activity: A Great Hope against COVID 19. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), alpha- and beta-defensins, possess antiviral properties. These AMPs achieve viral inhibition through different mechanisms of action. For example, they can: (i) bind directly to virions; (ii) bind to and modulate host cell-surface receptors, disrupting intracellular signaling; (iii) function as chemokines to augment and alter adaptive immune responses. Given their antiviral properties and the fact that the development of an effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment is an urgent public health priority, they and their derivatives are being explored as potential therapies against COVID-19. These explorations using various strategies, range from their direct interaction with the virus to using them as vaccine adjuvants. However, AMPs do not work in isolation, specifically in their role as potent immune modulators, where they interact with toll-like receptors (TLRs) and chemokine receptors. Both of these receptors have been shown to play roles in COVID-19 pathogenesis. In addition, it is known that a healthy lifestyle accompanied by controlled physical activity can represent a natural weapon against COVID-19. In competitive athletes, an increase in serum defensins has been shown to function as self-protection from the attack of microorganisms, consequently a controlled physical activity could act as a support to any therapies in fighting COVID-19. Therefore, including information on all these players' interactions would produce a complete picture of AMP-based therapies' response.	Mechanism;Treatment
34286681	Effects of Patient Characteristics on Diagnostic Performance of Self-Collected Samples for SARS-CoV-2 Testing. We evaluated the performance of self-collected anterior nasal swab (ANS) and saliva samples compared with healthcare worker-collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens used to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We used the same PCR diagnostic panel to test all self-collected and healthcare worker-collected samples from participants at a public hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Among 1,076 participants, 51.9% were men, 57.1% were >50 years of age, 81.2% were Black (non-Hispanic), and 74.9% reported >1 chronic medical condition. In total, 8.0% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Compared with nasopharyngeal swab samples, ANS samples had a sensitivity of 59% and saliva samples a sensitivity of 68%. Among participants tested 3-7 days after symptom onset, ANS samples had a sensitivity of 80% and saliva samples a sensitivity of 85%. Sensitivity varied by specimen type and patient characteristics. These findings can help physicians interpret PCR results for SARS-CoV-2.	Diagnosis
34226864	Influences of weather-related parameters on the spread of Covid-19 pandemic - The scenario of Bangladesh. Objective: Weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, air quality index and wind speed are the important factors influencing the infectious diseases like Covid-19. Therefore, this study aims to discuss and analyse the relation between weather parameters and the spread of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from the perspective of Bangladesh. Methods: Correlation among weather parameters and infection and death rate were established using several graphical plots and wind rose diagrams, Kendall and Spearman correlation and appropriate discussion with relevancy and reference. Information presented in this study has been extracted from 1st April 2020 to 30th December 2020. Results: Analyses show that with the decrease in temperature, infection rate increased significantly. Also, the number of infection increases as wind speed increases. As the absolute humidity rate of Bangladesh is almost constant; therefore, the authors are unable to predict any relation of absolute humidity with the number of infection. Further, the prediction for the number of infections based on the wind direction for the several regions of seven divisions in Bangladesh is vulnerable for the upcoming several months. Conclusion: This study has analysed the dependency of weather parameters on a number of infections along with predicting the upcoming danger zones.	Prevention
34373848	Colorectal Cancer Care and Patients' Perceptions Before and During COVID-19: Implications for Subsequent SARS-CoV-2 Infection Waves. Background: Changes in colorectal cancer (CRC) care planning because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and well-being of patients with CRC are unknown. We report changes in CRC care and patient-reported outcomes including HRQoL, distress, and loneliness during the first wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: In April 2020, 4984 patients included in the nationwide Prospective Dutch Colorectal Cancer cohort were invited to complete a COVID-19-specific questionnaire, together with the validated European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), De Jong Gierveld, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Clinical data were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Scores were compared with the year prior to COVID-19 and with an age- and sex-matched control population during COVID-19. Results: In total, 3247 (65.1%) patients responded between April and June 2020. Of the patients, 17% had canceled, postponed, or changed hospital visits to a telephone or video consult, and 5.3% had adjusted, postponed, or canceled treatment. Compared with controls, patients reported worse HRQoL but comparable distress and less social loneliness (patients = 21.2%; controls = 32.9%). Compared with pre-COVID-19, clinically meaningful deterioration of HRQoL was more prevalent in patients with changes in cancer care planning than in patients without changes. Prior to undergoing or currently undergoing treatment and infection worries were associated with lower HRQoL. Conclusions: CRC patients reported equal anxiety and depression but worse HRQoL than the control population. Changes in care planning were associated with deterioration of HRQoL and increased anxiety. In case of 1 or more risk factors, health-care specialists should discuss (mental) health status and possible support during future SARS-CoV-2 infection waves or comparable pandemics.	Prevention
34220355	The National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools (NCCMT): Supporting evidence-informed decision-making in public health in Canada. The National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools (NCCMT) is part of a network of six National Collaborating Centres for Public Health (NCC) created in 2005 by the federal government following the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic to strengthen public health infrastructure in Canada. The work of the NCCMT, to support evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM) in public health in Canada, is accomplished by curating trustworthy evidence, building competence to use evidence and accelerating change in EIDM. Ongoing engagement with its target audiences ensures NCCMT's relevance and ability to respond to evolving public health needs. This has been particularly critical during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which saw NCCMT pivot its activities to support the public health response by conducting rapid reviews on priority questions identified by decision-makers from federal to local levels as well as create and maintain a national repository of in-progress or completed syntheses. These efforts, along with partnering with the COVID-19 Evidence Network to support Decision-Making (COVID-END), sought to reduce duplication, increase coordination of synthesis efforts and support decision-makers to use the best available evidence in decision-making. Data from website statistics illustrate the successful uptake of these initiatives across Canada and internationally.	Prevention
34202510	Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in HIV-Infected Patients in Rome, Italy during the COVID-19 Outbreak. BACKGROUND: this study aimed to determine the proportion of people living with HIV (PLWH) with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in a large sample from a single HIV referral center in Rome, Italy; the time-frame included both the first and the second wave of the Italian COVID-19 pandemic; Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study on stored cryopreserved samples from 1 March 2020 to 30 November 2020. Total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were preliminarily tested using a chemiluminescent immunoassay. Positive results were re-tested with an ELISA assay as an IgG confirmatory test; Results: overall, 1389 samples were analyzed from 1106 PLWH: 69% males, median age 53 years, 94% on antiretroviral treatment, 93% with HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL, median CD4 cell count 610 cell/microL. Our analysis revealed a total of n = 8 patients who tested IgG positive during the study period. Seroprevalence was equal to 0% in the first months (March-June); this started to increase in July and reached a maximum rate of 1.59% in October 2020. The overall seroprevalence was 0.72% (8/1106, 95% CI 0.37-1.42). CONCLUSION: our findings from this setting show a low IgG SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among PLWH as compared to data available from the general population.	Diagnosis
34205178	Screen-Printed Graphene/Carbon Electrodes on Paper Substrates as Impedance Sensors for Detection of Coronavirus in Nasopharyngeal Fluid Samples. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the global pandemic, which has resulted in more than one million deaths with tens of millions reported cases, requires a fast, accurate, and portable testing mechanism operable in the field environment. Electrochemical sensors, based on paper substrates with portable electrochemical devices, can prove an excellent alternative in mitigating the economic and public health effects of the disease. Herein, we present an impedance biosensor for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein utilizing the IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody. This label-free platform utilizing screen-printed electrodes works on the principle of redox reaction impedance of a probe and can detect antigen spikes directly in nasopharyngeal fluid as well as virus samples collected in the universal transport medium (UTM). High conductivity graphene/carbon ink is used for this purpose so as to have a small background impedance that leads to a wider dynamic range of detection. Antibody immobilization onto the electrode surface was conducted through a chemical entity or a biological entity to see their effect; where a biological immobilization can enhance the antibody loading and thereby the sensitivity. In both cases, we were able to have a very low limit of quantification (i.e., 0.25 fg/mL), however, the linear range was 3 orders of magnitude wider for the biological entity-based immobilization. The specificity of the sensor was also tested against high concentrations of H1N1 flu antigens with no appreciable response. The most optimized sensors are used to identify negative and positive COVID-19 samples with great accuracy and precision.	Diagnosis
34337381	Investigation and management of an outbreak of COVID-19 infection in an acute admission unit in a District General Hospital: lessons learnt. Background: SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are difficult to recognise and control due to its high infectivity and the wide range of clinical manifestations of the infection. An outbreak at Watford general hospital provided an opportunity to recognise the complexity involved in a COVID-19 outbreak investigation. Methods: An outbreak control team (OCT) was convened. The terms outbreak, a case and a significant exposure were defined as per Public Health England (PHE) Guidance and in the context of the local outbreak. Root cause analyses (RCAs) were carried out on cases to identify possible causes, possible route of transmission and any learning points. All contact patients and staff were screened with RT PCR and genomic sequencing was performed on a set of positive specimens.In addition to active contact tracing, screening and cohorting of patients and staff, standard and transmission-based precautions were reinforced to control the outbreak. Findings: Fifteen patients and four staff members were identified in this outbreak investigation. With contact tracing, screening and through strict infection control measures the outbreak was brought under control. Conclusion: We could successfully contain the spread of this outbreak following PHE outbreak control guidelines and our local guidelines. We recognised several challenges in investigating a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital setting. Problems arising from variable sensitivity of the tests, difficulty in differentiating COVID-19 related symptoms from underlying diseases, problems related to establishing the route of transmission, issues with contact tracing are discussed. Additionally, the importance and limitations of genomic studies in COVID-19 are discussed.	Prevention;Diagnosis
34213541	Clinical and Epidemiological Characteristics of Paediatric Patients Diagnosed with COVID-19 in a Tertiary Hospital in Mexico City. COVID-19 affects the paediatric population less frequently than adults. A retrospective study was performed in a tertiary paediatric hospital in Mexico City in children <18 years of age who were hospitalized with a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2. Included in the study were 86 patients with a median age of 10 years old (IQR 2.6-14.3 years), who were classified in three groups: previously healthy, with chronic disease and immunosuppressed patients. The principal signs and symptoms were fever (81%), cough (51%) and headache (35%). A total of 20 patients (23%) required management in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and 17% needed mechanical ventilation for an average of 12.7 days (IQR 2-29 days). There was no statistically significant difference between the three clinical classification groups in those patients admitted to the PICU, most of which were previously healthy patients. The mortality rate was 5% (four patients). Given that the paediatric population is susceptible to infection, potential transmitters and to clinical presentations with variable degrees of severity, it is important to continue reinforcing social distancing measures.

34219155	Left ventricular longitudinal strain alterations in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic paediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. AIMS: Compared with adult patients, clinical manifestations of children's coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are generally perceived as less severe. The objective of this study was to evaluate cardiac involvement in previously healthy children with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed a cohort of 53 paediatric patients (29 males, 55%), mean age 7.5 +/- 4.7 years, who had a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and were asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic for COVID-19. Patients underwent standard transthoracic echocardiogram and speckle tracking echocardiographic study at least 3 months after diagnosis. Thirty-two age, sex, and body surface area comparable healthy subjects were used as control group. Left ventricular ejection fraction was within normal limits but significantly lower in the cases group compared to controls (62.4 +/- 4.1% vs. 65.2 +/- 5.5%; P = 0.012). Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (20.1 +/- 3 mm vs. 19.8 +/- 3.4 mm; P = 0.822) and left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (-21.9 +/- 2.4% vs. -22.6 +/- 2.5%; P = 0.208) were comparable between the two groups. Regional LV strain analysis showed a significant reduction of the LV mid-wall segments strain among cases compared to controls. Furthermore, in the cases group, there were 14 subjects (26%) with a regional peak systolic strain below -16% (-2.5 Z score in our healthy cohort) in at least two segments. These subjects did not show any difference regarding symptoms or serological findings. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect left ventricular deformation in 26% of children despite an asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic acute illness. A follow-up is needed to verify the reversibility of these alterations and their impact on long-term outcomes.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34282057	Two novel nomograms based on inflammatory cytokines or lymphocyte subsets to differentially diagnose severe or critical and Non-Severe COVID-19. We intend to evaluate the differences of the clinical characteristics, cytokine profiles and immunological features in patients with different severity of COVID-19, and to develop novel nomograms based on inflammatory cytokines or lymphocyte subsets for the differential diagnostics for severe or critical and non-severe COVID-19 patients. We retrospectively studied 254 COVID-19 patients, 90 of whom were severe or critical patients and 164 were non-severe patients. Severe or critical patients had significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than non-severe patients as well as lower levels of lymphocyte subsets. Significantly positive correlations between cytokine profiles were observed, while they were all significantly negatively correlated with lymphocyte subsets. Two effective nomograms were developed according to two multivariable logistic regression cox models based on inflammatory cytokine profiles and lymphocyte subsets separately. The areas under the receiver operating characteristics of two nomograms were 0.834 (95% CI: 0.779-0.888) and 0.841 (95% CI: 0.756-0.925). The bootstrapped-concordance indexes of two nomograms were 0.834 and 0.841 in training set, and 0.860 and 0.852 in validation set. Calibration curves and decision curve analyses demonstrated that the nomograms were well calibrated and had significantly more clinical net benefits. Our novel nomograms can accurately predict disease severity of COVID-19, which may facilitate the identification of severe or critical patients and assist physicians in making optimized treatment suggestions.

34337384	Clinical utility of a rapid 'on-demand' laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing service in an acute hospital setting admitting COVID-19 patients. Background: With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, hospital clinical teams have realised that there is a need for a rapid, accurate testing facility that will allow them to move patients quickly into isolation rooms or specific COVID-19 cohort wards as soon as possible after admission. Methods: Starting from July 2020, PCR-based test platforms, which could test 4-8 samples in parallel with turnaround (sample-to-result) times of 50-80 min, were placed in a satellite laboratory. This laboratory was on the same floor and within walking distance to the acute respiratory admissions ward. It was staffed by a team of three mid-Band 4 staff that split a 0700-2200 h-work day, 7 days a week, with 2 senior supervisors. Urgent sample testing was decided upon by the clinical teams and requested by phone. The test results were entered manually in real-time as they became available, and sent electronically to the requesting ward teams. Results: The daily/monthly PCR positive test numbers approximately followed the local and national UK trend in COVID-19 case numbers, with the daily case numbers being reflective of the November and December 2020 surges. Test results were used to rapidly segregate positive patients into dedicated COVID-19 ward areas to minimise risk of potential nosocomial transmission in crowded waiting areas. Testing capacity was sufficient to include cases with uncertain diagnosis likely to require hospital admission. Following completion of other admission processes, based on these rapid test results, patients were allocated to dedicated COVID-19 positive or negative cohort wards. Conclusions: This rapid testing facility reduced unnecessary 'length-of-stay' in a busy acute respiratory ward. In the current absence of a treatment for mild-to-moderate COVID-19, on which patients could be discharged home to complete, the rapid test facility has become a successful aid to patient flow and reduced exposure and nosocomial transmission.

34349593	Evaluation of Patients with Suspicion of COVID-19 in Pediatric Emergency Department. Objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have different clinical presentations in children. Most symptomatic children with suspicion of COVID-19 have fever and respiratory symptoms. In this retrospective study, we aimed to describe demographic features, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of confirmed and probable COVID-19 patients admitted to our pediatric emergency department (ED). Methods: We identified 135 children (aged 1 month-18 years) with suspicion of the COVID-19 who were admitted to our ED between March 11 and May 12, 2020. The urgency of patients was evaluated according to their Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT) and Emergency Severity Index (ESI) scores. Patients were divided into two groups as confirmed cases (Group 1) and probable cases (Group 2). Clinical, laboratory, radiologic features, and the disease severity of patients were analyzed. Results: According to PAT evaluation, 82 patients (65.6%) were non-urgent. The most frequent ESI triage category level was 3 (n=102, 76.1%). Forty-one (30.4%) patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed cases. Fifty-five (40.7%) patients were between 28 days and 4 years of age. Fever with cough was the most frequent symptoms at the onset of illness in COVID-19 positive patients (n=16, 39%). Sixty-four (47.4%) patients had mild disease and 40 (29.6%) patients had comorbidities. In Group 1, neutropenia was significantly higher than Group 2 (p=0.024). Mean procalcitonin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels of Group 2 were significantly higher than Group 1 (p=0.012 and p=0.028, respectively). Twenty-eight of 51 patients had chest computed tomography findings which were compatible with COVID-19. Fifty-one (37.8%) patients were discharged from ED, 81 (60%) were admitted to the ward, and 3 (2.2%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Conclusion: During our study, we confirmed the diagnosis of 45 of 135 probable cases with the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. Among confirmed COVID-19 cases, most of our patients had mild or moderate disease. The clinic of only confirmed three patients was classified as severe disease, and we had no critically ill patient.

34293732	A perspective on hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infection control of COVID-19: usefulness of spatial separation between wards and airborne isolation unit. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed a considerable burden on hospitals and healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide, increasing the risk of outbreaks and nosocomial transmission to 'non-COVID-19' patients, who represent the highest-risk population in terms of mortality, and HCWs. Since HCWs are at the interface between hospitals on the one hand and the community on the other, they are potential reservoirs, carriers, or victims of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 cross-transmission. In addition, there has been a paradigm shift in the management of viral respiratory outbreaks, such as the widespread testing of patients and HCWs, including asymptomatic individuals. In hospitals, there is a risk of aerosol transmission in poorly ventilated spaces, and when performing aerosol-producing procedures, it is imperative to take measures against aerosol transmission. In particular, spatial separation of the inpatient ward for non-COVID-19 patients from that designated for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 as well as negative-pressure isolation on the floor of the ward, using an airborne infection isolation device could help prevent nosocomial infection.

34221480	SARS-CoV-2-related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children: A case series. On 27 April 2020, the National Health Service England issued an emergency alert for a new condition owing to the observation of an increasing number of cases of a COVID-19-related hyperinflammatory syndrome termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Some of the presenting symptoms appeared similar to the Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. We report the cases of six children fitting the criteria of MIS-C, admitted to Royal Hospital and Sohar Hospital, Oman, between the months of June and July in 2020. Four of these patients required admission at the paediatric intensive care unit for inotropic support while two were admitted to the paediatric ward on suspicion of appendicitis. MIS-C has been reported in a small number of individuals below the age of 21 years with a median age of 9-10 years. Five of the current patients were aged less than the median age reported in the existing literature. All of the patients showed complete recovery with supportive management, intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids, with one patient requiring interleukin-6 inhibitor (tocilizumab).	Case Report
34291824	Surgical oncology operative experience at a high-volume safety-net hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic led to disruptions in operative and hospital capabilities as the country triaged resources and canceled elective procedures. This study details the operative experience of a safety-net hospital for cancer-related operations during a 3-month period at the height of the pandemic. METHODS: Patients operated on for or diagnosed with malignancies of the abdomen, breast, skin, or soft-tissue (September 3, 2020-September 6, 2020) were identified from operative/clinic schedules. Sociodemographics, tumor and treatment characteristics, and COVID-19 information was identified through retrospective chart review of a prospectively maintained database. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: Fifty patients evaluated within this window underwent oncologic surgery. Median age was 61 (interquartile range: 53-68), 56% were female, 86% were White, and 66% were Hispanic. The majority (28%) were for colon cancer. Only two patients tested positive for COVID-19 preoperatively or within 30 days of their operation. There were no mortalities during the 1-year study period. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many hospitals and operative centers limited interventions to preserve resources, but oncologic procedures continued at many large-volume academic cancer centers. This study underscores the importance of continuing to offer surgery during the pandemic for surgical oncology cases at safety-net hospitals to minimize delays in time-sensitive oncologic treatment.

34366140	COVID-19 in Health Care Personnel: Significance of Health Care Role, Contact History, and Symptoms in Those Who Test Positive for SARS-CoV-2 Infection. OBJECTIVE: To identify significant factors that help predict whether health care personnel (HCP) will test positive for severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study among 7015 symptomatic HCP from March 25, 2020, through November 11, 2020. We analyzed the associations between health care role, contact history, symptoms, and a positive nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test results, using univariate and multivariable modelling. RESULTS: Of the symptomatic HCP, 624 (8.9%) were positive over the study period. On multivariable analysis, having a health care role other than physician or advanced practice provider, contact with family or community member with known or suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and seven individual symptoms (cough, anosmia, ageusia, fever, myalgia, chills, and headache) were significantly associated with higher adjusted odds ratios for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. For each increase in symptom number, the odds of testing positive nearly doubled (odds ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.82 to 2.07, P<.001). CONCLUSION: Symptomatic HCP have higher adjusted odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on three distinct factors: (1) nonphysician/advanced practice provider role, (2) contact with a family or community member with suspected or known COVID-19, and (3) specific symptoms and symptom number. Differences among health care roles, which persisted after controlling for contacts, may reflect the influence of social determinants. Contacts with COVID-19-positive patients and/or HCP were not associated with higher odds of testing positive, supporting current infection control efforts. Targeted symptom and contact questionnaires may streamline symptomatic HCP testing for COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34286449	Comparison between myocardial function assessed by echocardiography during hospitalization for COVID-19 and at 4 months follow-up. In patients hospitalized for corona virus infectious disease 19 (COVID-19) it is currently unknown whether myocardial function changes after recovery and whether this is related to elevated cardiac biomarkers. In this single center, prospective cohort study we consecutively enrolled hospitalized COVID-19 patients between 1 April and 12 May 2020. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) evaluation during hospitalization and at a median of 131 days (IQR; 116-136) follow-up. Of the 51 patients included at baseline, 40 (age: 62 years (IQR; 54-68), 78% male) were available for follow-up TTE. At baseline, 68% of the patients had a normal TTE, regarding left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) volumes and function, compared to 83% at follow-up (p = 0.07). Median LV ejection fraction (60% vs. 58%, p = 0.54) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (23 vs 22 mm, p = 0.18) were comparable between hospitalization and follow-up, but a significantly lower RV diameter (39 vs. 34 mm, p = 0.002) and trend towards better global longitudinal strain (GLS) (- 18.5% vs - 19.1%, p = 0.07) was found at follow-up. Subgroup analysis showed no relation between patients with and without elevated TroponinT and/or NT-proBNP during hospitalization and myocardial function at follow-up. Although there were no significant differences in individual myocardial function parameters at 4 months follow-up compared to hospitalisation for COVID-19, there was an overall trend towards normalization in myocardial function, predominantly due to a higher rate of normal GLS at follow-up.

34222319	Case Report: Liver Cysts and SARS-CoV-2: No Evidence of Virus in Cystic Fluid. Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia, caused by a new type of coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It quickly spread worldwide, resulting in a pandemic. The clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 range from mild non-specific symptoms to severe pneumonia with organ function damage. In addition, up to 60% of patients have liver impairment or dysfunction, confirmed by several studies by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the liver tissue. Methods: We report two cases of symptomatic liver cyst requiring fenestration after recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both patients had hospital admission due to documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, after the infection, they developed symptoms caused by an enlarged hepatic cyst: one had abdominal pain, and the other had jaundice. They underwent surgery after two negative swab tests for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Cystic fluid was sent for microbiological test, and real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction COVID-19 nucleic-acid assay of the cyst fluid was found to be negative in both cases. Discussion: Although there are no current data that can document a viral contamination of cystic fluid, there are data that document a hepatotropism of COVID-19 virus. Herein we report that after viral clearance at pharyngeal and nasal swab, there is no evidence of viral load in such potential viral reservoir.	Case Report
34224668	Immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and early clinical outcomes in patients with haematological malignancies in Lithuania: a national prospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Haematological malignancies and their treatments are likely to affect SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy. We aimed to evaluate serological response to BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with haematological malignancies by type of treatment. METHODS: Our national prospective cohort study was done in Lithuania and assessed serological response to one and two BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine doses in healthy health-care workers and in patients with haematological malignancies. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had received both vaccine doses, and had available biobanked blood samples from before vaccination and after the second dose. Biobanked samples and health data were obtained from Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos Biobank. Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quant II chemiluminescent microparticle assay was used to quantify serum anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG antibody (anti-S1 IgG antibody) concentrations 0-10 days before the first BNT162b2 vaccine, on the day of second immunisation (around day 21), and 7 to 21 days after the second immunisation. Adverse events were assessed by a standardised questionnaire. Breakthrough infections were characterised clinically and by SARS-CoV-2 genotyping whenever possible. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04871165. FINDINGS: Between Jan 8 and April 21, 2021, 885 participants with haematological malignancies were included in the study. 857 patients were anti-S1 IgG seronegative at timepoint 0 and constituted the main analysis cohort. The age-matched comparison was made between 315 patients with haematological malignancies who were aged 18-60 years and 67 healthy health-care workers in the same age group. Patients aged 18-60 years with haematological malignancies had lower median anti-S1 IgG antibody responses after two BNT162b2 vaccine doses than did health-care workers of the same age group (median 6961 AU/mL [IQR 1292-20 672] vs 21 395 AU/mL [14 831-33 553]; p<0.0001). Compared with untreated patients with haematological malignancies (n=53; median 5761 AU/mL [629-16 141]), patients actively treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKIs; n=44; 0 AU/mL [0-7]; p<0.0001), ruxolitinib (n=16; 10 AU/mL [0-45]; p<0.0001), venetoclax (n=10; 4 AU/mL [0-1218]; p=0.0005), or anti-CD20 antibody therapy (n=87; 17 AU/mL [1-2319]; p<0.0001) showed particularly poor anti-S1 IgG antibody responses following two BNT162b2 doses. Patients being treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (n=41; 10 537 AU/mL [IQR 2335-19 388]) or patients who received autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT; n=192; 6203 AU/mL [1451-16 834]) or allogeneic HSCT (n=122; 6304 AU/mL [1120-16 913]) were among the subgroups with the highest numerical responses. Nine SARS-CoV-2 infections and three COVID-19 deaths were observed among fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies. INTERPRETATION: Patients with haematological malignancies mount blunted and heterogeneous antibody responses to the full course of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. Patients who are actively treated with BTKIs, ruxolitinib, venetoclax, or anti-CD20 antibody therapies seem to be the most negatively affected and might be left unprotected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Breakthrough severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies emphasise the importance of ongoing strict adherence to non-pharmacological interventions and household vaccination while SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in the community.

34216078	Moderate acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in patients pre- and post-heart transplantation: Experiences from a German Transplant Centre. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Patients awaiting heart transplantation (HTx) are at increased risk developing severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients supported by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) face additional risks due to coagulopathies during COVID-19. Following HTx, elevated risk factors for severe COVID-19 persist due to chronic immunosuppression and frequent comorbidities. Taken together, COVID-19 vaccination is of critical importance in all three patient cohorts. Here, we report our experience to deliver COVID-19 vaccination in a German transplant center. METHODS AND RESULTS: We screened 211 patients for contraindications and offered the remaining 186 eligible patients COVID-19 vaccination. Of those, 133 patients (71%) accepted the offer and were vaccinated. Acceptance of vaccination differed between HTx recipients (84 of 113, 74%), patients on the waiting list (34 of 47, 72%), and patients with LVAD support (28 of 50, 56%). The LVAD cohort demonstrated lower acceptance levels for vaccination compared to HTx recipients and patients awaiting HTx (74% vs. 56%; p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate for the first time only moderate acceptance levels of COVID-19 vaccination in HTx recipients and candidates on the waiting list compared to general population, despite perceived high-risk for severe disease. Additionally, those supported by LVAD have even lower adherence. Efforts may need to be made to increase acceptance in this vulnerable as well as cost-intensive patient cohort.	Treatment
34215019	Pharmacokinetic profiles of a SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibody BD-604 in cynomolgus monkeys. BACKGROUND: Currently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has spread worldwide as a severe pandemic and effective therapeutic medications are urgently needed. As reported previously, BD-604 is a fully human monoclonal antibody with strong in vitro and in vivo neutralizing activity to SARS-COV-2. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic propertie of BD-604 in cynomolgus monkeys. METHODS: To analyze the concentration of BD-604 in cynomolgus monkey serum, an ELISA assay was established, and a systemic validation was performed including accuracy and precision, dilution linearity and hook effect, selectivity, specificity, stability, and parallelism tests. Then, six naive cynomolgus monkeys (3/sex) were administered BD-604 at a single dose of 10 mg/kg via intravenous infusion (60 min). Blood samples were collected at various time points (0-672 h) and analyzed for serum concentrations of BD-604. RESULTS: The data from validation experiments assure the reproducibility and reliability of the established ELISA assay. Then, the validated method was used to measure BD-604 concentration in cynomolgus monkey serum. The pharmacokinetics parameters including terminal half-life (t1/2 ), peak serum concentration (Cmax ), area under curve from time zero to last timepoint or infinity (AUClast /AUCinf ), apparent volume of distribution (Vz ), clearance rate (CL), and mean residence time (MRT) were calculated and reported. BD-604 showed no marked sex differences at the dose of 10 mg/kg when comparing the AUC0-last and Cmax between female and male cynomolgus monkeys. CONCLUSION: In cynomolgus monkeys, BD-604 possesses pharmacokinetic properties similar to natural IgGs.	Treatment
34202591	Pattern of Visits in a Metropolitan Emergency Department in Lombardia (Italy): January 2019-December 2020. During the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a general decrease in the presentations to emergency departments (ED) was reported. However, we suspect that there was a lower number but an unchanged pattern of ED visits for urgent conditions in 2020 compared to 2019. This retrospective study assessed the change in the number of presentations in the ED of a tertiary level university hospital in Milano (Lombardia, Italy). Compared to 2019, a significant drop in ED presentations occurred (-46.4%), and we recorded a -15.7% difference in the proportion of patients admitted with white codes. The pattern of hourly presentations to the ED was unchanged, with overcrowding during the working daytime. COVID-19 changed ED flows, likely causing an overall reduction in the number of deferrable conditions. However, the pattern associated with urgent conditions did not change abruptly in 2020.

34375761	Severe features during outbreak but low mortality observed immediately before and after a March-May Covid-19 outbreak in Stockholm, Sweden.: Mortality before, during and after a COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVES: Here we aimed to estimate how well the excess mortality reflected the burden of COVID-19-related deaths and whether the excess mortality during the outbreak might have resulted in a compensatory reduced mortality after the March-May Covid-19 outbreak in Stockholm, Sweden. METHODS: Using previous 10-year or 5-year average mortalities as a baseline we compared the excess mortality estimates before, during and after the March-May 2020 outbreak in Stockholm. RESULTS: Weekly death estimates revealed that the immediate pre-outbreak and post-outbreak all-cause mortalities did not exceed to excess mortalities regardless of using previous 10-year or 5-year average mortalities. Forty-three days after the start of the outbreak, 74.4% of the total excess mortality was reportedly explained by known COVID-19-related deaths, and here we update that 15 weeks after the start of the outbreak the reported COVID-19-related deaths explained >99% of the total excess mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Exceptional outbreak feature of rapid excess mortality was observed. However, no excess but similarly low mortality was observed immediately prior to the outbreak and post-outbreak, and thus emphasizing the severity of the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Stockholm.

34203143	Brain Mechanisms of COVID-19-Sleep Disorders. 2020 and 2021 have been unprecedented years due to the rapid spread of the modified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus around the world. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes atypical infiltrated pneumonia with many neurological symptoms, and major sleep changes. The exposure of people to stress, such as social confinement and changes in daily routines, is accompanied by various sleep disturbances, known as 'coronasomnia' phenomenon. Sleep disorders induce neuroinflammation, which promotes the blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and entry of antigens and inflammatory factors into the brain. Here, we review findings and trends in sleep research in 2020-2021, demonstrating how COVID-19 and sleep disorders can induce BBB leakage via neuroinflammation, which might contribute to the 'coronasomnia' phenomenon. The new studies suggest that the control of sleep hygiene and quality should be incorporated into the rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients. We also discuss perspective strategies for the prevention of COVID-19-related BBB disorders. We demonstrate that sleep might be a novel biomarker of BBB leakage, and the analysis of sleep EEG patterns can be a breakthrough non-invasive technology for diagnosis of the COVID-19-caused BBB disruption.

34220352	Bioaerosols from mouth-breathing: Under-recognized transmissible mode in COVID-19? The whole world has been affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and many researchers are racing to understand the disease course and to undertake risk analyses to formulate effective treatment strategies. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly transmissible through coughing and sneezing, and through breathing and talking which may account for viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers. Bioaerosols produced during mouth-breathing, an expiratory process in habitual mouth breathers, should be considered in addition to nasal bioparticles as a potential transmissible mode in COVID-19. Oral health professionals are justifiably apprehensive about the exposure risk due to close face-to-face contact and the mode of transmission. The aim of this commentary is to summarize the research conducted in this area and suggested strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19, especially in dental offices.	Prevention;Transmission
34207314	Isolation of Viable SARS-CoV-2 Virus from Feces of an Immunocompromised Patient Suggesting a Possible Fecal Mode of Transmission. (1) Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) excretion in stools is well documented by RT-PCR, but evidences that stools contain infectious particles are scarce. (2) Methods: After observing a Corona Virus 2019 Disease (COVID-19) epidemic cluster associated with a ruptured sewage pipe, we search for such a viable SARS-CoV-2 particle in stool by inoculating 106 samples from 46 patients. (3) Results: We successfully obtained two isolates from a unique patient with kidney transplantation under immunosuppressive therapy who was admitted for severe diarrhea. (4) Conclusions: This report emphasizes that SARS-CoV-2 is an enteric virus, and infectious virus particles can be isolated from the stool of immune-compromised patients like, in our case, kidney transplant recipient. Immune-compromised patients are likely to have massive multiplication of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract and this report suggests possible fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.	Transmission
34283959	Heart transplantation complicated by COVID-19 infection. The influence of COVID-19 on heart transplantation is considerable. Reports of COVID-19 infection in recently transplanted patients are scarce. We present a 60-year-old patient with COVID-19 infection, diagnosed six days after transplantation. His clinical course revealed two phases: Initially, there were mild respiratory symptoms for which he was treated with remdesivir and noninvasive respiratory support. In a second phase with clinical deterioration on postoperative day 22, further respiratory decline led to the administration of convalescent plasma, with satisfactory response and further improvement of his condition.

34212406	The dilemma of treating the infected versus the wounded: Gaza's healthcare system is choked. Gaza has been facing persistent disturbance since the last 14 years. Even before the pandemic, Gaza faced a dire healthcare consequence with prevalent instability, lack of adequate medical resources, and limited health-related infrastructure. Gaza continued to struggle while responding to the pandemic as the other nearby countries. However, the challenges were compounded with the onset of the conflict that affected Gaza's infrastructure and displaced tens of thousands to make-shift shelters. The testing capacity of Gaza is alarmingly low that makes any outbreak difficult to document. Additionally, all medical centres have been affected by the ongoing conflict. These centres, if not directly impacted, are severely overwhelmed with those injured during the conflict, shifting focus and resources away from coronavirus. Vaccinations in Gaza cover only 1.9% of the population and a great number of unvaccinated people now may act as vectors of transmission in overcrowded shelters. Furthermore, non-availability of clean water to maintain hygienic conditions has heightened the risk of an explosive surge in cases. Hence, beyond the ceasefire, further steps need to be taken to strengthen Gazan response to COVID-19 pandemic.	Prevention
34212542	COVID-19 Vaccine-associated Anaphylaxis and Allergic Reactions: Consensus Statements of the KAAACI Urticaria/Angioedema/Anaphylaxis Working Group. In the era of novel coronavirus epidemics, vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been recognized as the most effective public health interventions to control the pandemic. An adverse event following immunization (AEFI) is defined as any untoward occurrence following immunization, and the majority of AEFIs are caused by protective immune responses stimulated by vaccines. Most of the reported AEFIs are not serious, and many are not immunologically mediated or even reproducible on re-exposure. However, uncommon severe allergic adverse reactions, such as anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions, can occur after vaccinations. Confirmed allergic reactions to vaccines may be caused by residual non-human protein, preservatives, or stabilizers in the vaccine formulation (also known as excipients). There are 2 main potential allergenic/immunogenic excipients in COVID-19 vaccines, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polysorbate 80. PEG, also known as macrogol, is an ingredient in various laxatives and injectable formulations, such as depot steroids. Polysorbate 80 is present in various medical products, creams, ointments, lotions, and medication tablets. Contraindications to the administration of COVID-19 vaccines include a previous history of severe allergic reactions to the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine or proven hypersensitivity to a vaccine component, such as PEG or polysorbate 80. Anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions following immunization can cause fear and loss of confidence in the safety of vaccines among the public. A better understanding of these events is thought to help alleviate concerns about the current COVID-19 vaccines and provide reassurance to the general population by analyzing the exact incidence of anaphylaxis and potential risk factors. COVID-19 vaccine-associated anaphylaxis could be prevented and managed by risk stratification based on our local and global experience.	Treatment
34206507	A Summary of the SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines and Technologies Available or under Development. Since the beginning of 2020, the world has been in a race to develop vaccines that can control the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 250 projects have been initiated for this purpose, but only 14 of them have been authorized for use, despite being in phase 3 clinical trials. More than 40 other vaccines are also in phase 1/2 clinical trials and show promising outcomes. Regarding the appropriate choice of vaccines for each country or region, we reviewed the currently used vaccines in light of the different influencing parameters. These factors include the mode of action, dosage protocol, age group of the vaccinee, side effects, storage conditions, mounted immune response, and cost. Technically, there are seven types of vaccines developed against SARS-CoV-2: messenger RNA (mRNA), nonreplicating and replicating vectors, inactivated viruses, protein subunits, viral-like particles, DNA vaccines, and live attenuated vaccines. The mRNA type is being used for the first time in humans. Unfortunately, mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2 have started to appear worldwide, and researchers are investigating the effects of the currently used vaccines on them. There are many concerns regarding the long-term protection afforded by these vaccines and their side effects, and whether they require future modifications to be effective against the mutated variants. The development of new vaccines using more advanced technology is paramount for overcoming the difficulties in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic across the world.	Treatment
34336866	Is RAS the Link Between COVID-19 and Increased Stress in Head and Neck Cancer Patients? The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as a largely unexplained outbreak of pneumonia cases, in Wuhan City, China and rapidly spread across the world. By 11th March 2020, WHO declared it as a global pandemic. The resulting restrictions, to contain its spread, demanded a momentous change in the lifestyle of the general population as well as cancer patients. This augmented negative effects on the mental health of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC), who already battle with the stress of cancer diagnosis and treatment. The causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV2, gains entry through the Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is a component of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS). RAS has been shown to influence cancer and stress such that it can have progressive and suppressive effects on both. This review provides an overview of SARS-CoV2, looks at how the RAS provides a mechanistic link between stress, cancer and COVID-19 and the probable activation of the RAS axis that increase stress (anxiogenic) and tumor progression (tumorigenic), when ACE2 is hijacked by SARS-CoV2. The mental health crises brought about by this pandemic have been highlighted in many studies. The emerging links between cancer and stress make it more important than ever before to assess the stress burden of cancer patients and expand the strategies for its management.	Mechanism
34287338	Innate Immunity in Children and the Role of ACE2 Expression in SARS-CoV-2 Infection. COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is an emerging viral disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which leads to severe respiratory infections in humans. The first reports came in December 2019 from the city of Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China. It was immediately clear that children developed a milder disease than adults. The reasons for the milder course of the disease were attributed to several factors: innate immunity, difference in ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme II) receptor expression, and previous infections with other common coronaviruses (CovH). This literature review aims to summarize aspects of innate immunity by focusing on the role of ACE2 expression and viral infections in children in modulating the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Articles deemed potentially eligible were considered, including those dealing with COVID-19 in children and providing more up-to-date and significant data in terms of epidemiology, prognosis, course, and symptoms, focusing on the etiopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 disease in children. The bibliographic search was conducted using the search engines PubMed and Scopus. The following search terms were entered in PubMed and Scopus: COVID-19 AND ACE2 AND Children; COVID-19 AND Immunity innate AND children. The search identified 857 records, and 18 studies were applicable based on inclusion and exclusion criteria that addressed the issues of COVID-19 concerning the role of ACE2 expression in children. The scientific literature agrees that children develop milder COVID-19 disease than adults. Milder symptomatology could be attributed to innate immunity or previous CovH virus infections, while it is not yet fully understood how the differential expression of ACE2 in children could contribute to milder disease.

34199257	Assay System for Simultaneous Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Other Respiratory Viruses. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) triggers disease with nonspecific symptoms that overlap those of infections caused by other seasonal respiratory viruses (RVs), such as the influenza virus (Flu) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A molecular assay for accurate and rapid detection of RV and SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to manage these infections. Here, we compared the analytical performance and clinical reliability of Allplex SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV (SC2FabR; Seegene Inc., Seoul, South Korea) kit with those of four commercially available RV detection kits. Upon testing five target viral strains (SARS-CoV-2, FluA, FluB, RSV A, and RSV B), the analytical performance of SC2FabR was similar to that of the other kits, with no significant difference (p >/= 0.78) in z-scores. The efficiency of SC2FabR (E-value, 81-104%) enabled reliable SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal RV detection in 888 nasopharyngeal swab specimens processed using a fully automated nucleic acid extraction platform. Bland-Altman analyses revealed an agreement value of 95.4% (SD +/- 1.96) for the kits, indicating statistically similar results for all five. In conclusion, SC2FabR is a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool for both SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal RV detection, allowing for high-throughput RV analysis with efficiency comparable to that of commercially available kits. This can be used to help manage respiratory infections in patients during and after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.	Diagnosis
34344746	Increasing postpartum IUCD coverage through a QI initiative: a step towards reducing the unmet need of postpartum contraception. BACKGROUND: Unintended pregnancies have a negative impact on the health and economy of a nation, which can be prevented by effective family planning (FP) services. Postpartum intrauterine device (PPIUCD) is a safe and effective FP method which allows women to obtain long-acting contraception before discharge from the point of delivery. We observed poor coverage of deliveries with PPIUCD at our facility. This was the trigger to initiate a quality improvement (QI) initiative to increase the PPIUCD coverage from current rate of 4.5%-10% in 3-month period. METHOD: A fishbone analysis of the problem was done and the following causes were identified: lack of focused counselling for FP, lack of sensitisation and training of resident doctors and inconsistent supply of intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs). A QI team was constituted with representatives from faculty members, residents, interns, nursing officers and FP counsellors. The point of care quality improvement methodology was used. INTERVENTIONS: Daily counselling of antenatal women was started by the counsellors and interns in antenatal wards. A WhatsApp group of residents was made initially to sensitise them; and later for parking of problems and trouble shooting. The residents were provided hands-on training at skills lab. Uninterrupted supply of IUCDs was ensured by provision of buffer stock of IUCDs with respective store keepers. RESULT: The PPIUCD insertion rates improved from 4.5% to 19.2% at 3 months and have been sustained to a current 30%-35% after 1 (1/2) years of initiation of the project tiding through the turbulence during the COVID-19 pandemic using QI techniques. CONCLUSION: Sensitisation and training of residents as well as creation of awareness among antenatal women through targeted counselling helped improve PPIUCD coverage at the facility. QI initiatives have the potential to facilitate effective implementation of the FP programmes by strategic utilisation of the resources.	Prevention

The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has had major impact on human health worldwide. Whilst national and international COVID-19 lockdown and travel restriction measures have had widespread negative impact on economies and mental health, they may have beneficial effect on the environment, reducing air and water pollution. Mass bathing events (MBE) also known as Kumbh Mela are known to cause perturbations of the ecosystem affecting resilient bacterial populations within water of rivers in India. Lockdowns and travel restrictions provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of minimum anthropogenic activity on the river water ecosystem and changes in bacterial populations including antibiotic-resistant strains. We performed a spatiotemporal meta-analysis of bacterial communities of the Godavari River, India. Targeted metagenomics revealed a 0.87-fold increase in the bacterial diversity during the restricted activity of lockdown. A significant increase in the resilient phyla, viz. Proteobacteria (70.6%), Bacteroidetes (22.5%), Verrucomicrobia (1.8%), Actinobacteria (1.2%) and Cyanobacteria (1.1%), was observed. There was minimal incorporation of allochthonous bacterial communities of human origin. Functional profiling using imputed metagenomics showed reduction in infection and drug resistance genes by - 0.71-fold and - 0.64-fold, respectively. These observations may collectively indicate the positive implications of COVID-19 lockdown measures which restrict MBE, allowing restoration of the river ecosystem and minimise the associated public health risk.

34281105	In-House Filtration Efficiency Assessment of Vapor Hydrogen Peroxide Decontaminated Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs). To cope with the shortage of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), healthcare institutions have been forced to reuse FFRs using different decontamination methods, including vapor hydrogen peroxide (VHP). However, most healthcare institutions still struggle with evaluating the effect of VHP on filtration efficiency (FE) of the decontaminated FFRs. We developed a low-cost in-house FE assessment using a novel 3D-printed air duct. Furthermore, we assessed the FE of seven types of FFRs. Following 10 VHP cycles, we evaluated the FE of KN95 and 3M-N95 masks. The 3M-N95 and Benehal-N95 masks showed significant lower FE (80.4-91.8%) at fine particle sizes (0.3-1 microm) compared to other FFRs (FE >/= 98.1%, p < 0.05). Following 10 VHP cycles, the FE of KN95 masks was almost stable (FE stability > 99.1%) for all particle sizes, while 3M-N95 masks were stable only at 2 and 5 microm (FE stability > 98.0%). Statistically, FE stability of 3M-N95 masks at 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 microm was significantly lower (p </= 0.006) than 2 and 5 microm. The in-house FE assessment may be used as an emergency procedure to validate the decontaminated FFRs, as well as a screening option for production control of FFRs. Following VHP cycles, both masks showed high stability at 5 microm, the size of the most suspected droplets implicated in COVID-19 transmission.	Prevention
34210791	Cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and limitations 3 months after COVID-19 hospitalisation. RATIONALE: This study aimed to describe cardiopulmonary function during exercise 3 months after hospital discharge for COVID-19 and compare groups according to dyspnea and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. METHODS: Participants with COVID-19 discharged from five large Norwegian hospitals were consecutively invited to a multicentre, prospective cohort study. In total, 156 participants (mean age 56.2 years, 60 females) were examined with a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) 3 months after discharge and compared to a reference population. Dyspnea was assessed using the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (mMRC). RESULTS: Peak oxygen uptake (VO2) <80% of predicted was observed in 31% (n=49). Ventilatory efficiency was reduced in 15% (n=24), while breathing reserve <15% was observed in 16% (n=25). Oxygen pulse <80% of predicted was found in 18% (n=28). Dyspnea (mMRC >/=1) was reported by 38% (n=59). These participants had similar peak VO2 (p=0.10), but lower mean peak (sd) VO2.kg(-1) % of predicted compared to participants without dyspnea (mMRC 0) (76 (16)% versus 89 (18)%, p =0.009) due to higher body mass index (p=0.03). In participants treated at ICU versus non-ICU, mean peak (sd) VO2% of predicted were 82 (15)% and 90 (17)% (p=0.004), respectively. Ventilation, breathing reserve, and ventilatory efficiency were similar between the ICU and non-ICU groups. CONCLUSIONS: One- third experienced peak VO2 <80% of predicted 3 months after hospital discharge for COVID-19. Dyspneic participants were characterised by lower exercise capacity due to obesity and lower ventilatory efficiency. Ventilation and ventilatory efficiency were similar between ICU- and non-ICU-treated participants.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34344867	Thromboembolism after COVID-19 vaccine in patients with preexisting thrombocytopenia. While vaccination is the single most effective intervention to drastically reduce severe disease and death following SARS-CoV-2 infection, as shown in UK and Israel, some serious concerns have been raised for an unusual adverse drug reaction (ADR), including vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) with concurrent low platelets as well as capillary leak syndrome. In fact, the overall safety of the vaccine is highlighted by the low frequency of ADR considering that in UK, by the early June, 40 million first doses and 29 million second doses have been injected; nonetheless, 390 thrombotic events, including 71 fatal events have been reported. Interestingly, the cases reported low platelet counts with the presence of anti-platelet factor-4 (PF4) antibodies, indicating an abnormal clotting reaction. Here, out of three referred cases, we report a post-vaccine clinical case of fatal thrombosis with postmortem examination and whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis, whose pathogenesis appeared associated to a preexisting condition of thrombocytopenia due to myelodysplasia.

34205928	Post-COVID-19 Pulmonary Fibrosis: Novel Sequelae of the Current Pandemic. Since the initial identification of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. As effective vaccines and treatments begin to emerge, it will become increasingly important to identify and proactively manage the long-term respiratory complications of severe disease. The patterns of imaging abnormalities coupled with data from prior coronavirus outbreaks suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia are likely at an increased risk of progression to interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic pulmonary vascular disease. In this paper, we briefly review the definition, classification, and underlying pathophysiology of interstitial lung disease (ILD). We then review the current literature on the proposed mechanisms of lung injury in severe COVID-19 infection, and outline potential viral- and immune-mediated processes implicated in the development of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis (PCPF). Finally, we address patient-specific and iatrogenic risk factors that could lead to PCPF and discuss strategies for reducing risk of pulmonary complications/sequelae.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Treatment
34227264	Lessons from Cadaver Dissection during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The rapid increase of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic from mid-February 2020 has led the anatomy department of the Korea University College of Medicine to cease the dissection laboratory. However, the hands-on anatomy laboratory experience is paramount to maximizing learning outcomes. In this paper, we share the experiences and lessons learned through the face-to-face cadaveric dissection experience during this disruptive situation. To minimize infection risks, the following strategies were applied: first, students' on-campus attendance was reduced; second, body temperatures and symptoms were checked before entering the laboratory, and personal protective equipment was provided to all participants; and third, a negative pressure air circulation system was used in the dissection room. We suggest that conducting face-to-face cadaveric anatomy dissection is feasible when the daily count of newly infected cases stabilizes, and there is ample provision of safety measures to facilitate hands-on education.

34210994	TBK1 and TNFRSF13B mutations and an autoinflammatory disease in a child with lethal COVID-19. Among children, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are typically mild. Here, we describe the case of a 3.5-year-old girl with an unusually severe presentation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The child had an autoinflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, which had been treated using prednisolone and methotrexate, and her parents were half cousins of Turkish descent. After 5 days of nonspecific viral infection symptoms, tonic-clonic seizures occurred followed by acute cardiac insufficiency, multi-organ insufficiency, and ultimate death. Trio exome sequencing identified a homozygous splice-variant in the gene TBK1, and a homozygous missense variant in the gene TNFRSF13B. Heterozygous deleterious variants in the TBK1 gene have been associated with severe COVID-19, and the variant in the TNFRSF13B gene has been associated with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). We suggest that the identified variants, the autoinflammatory disorder and its treatment, or a combination of these factors probably predisposed to lethal COVID-19 in the present case.	Case Report
34283810	Nucleocapsid-specific and PD-L1+CXCR3+ CD8 polyfunctional T-cell abundances are associated with survival of critical SARS-CoV2-infected patients. RATIONALE: The importance of the adaptative T cell response in the control and resolution of viral infection has been well-established. However, the nature of T cell-mediated viral control mechanisms in life-threatening stages of COVID-19 has yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine the function and phenotype of T cell populations associated with survival or death of COVID-19 patients under intensive care as a result of phenotypic and functional profiling by mass cytometry. FINDINGS: Increased frequencies of circulating, polyfunctional, CD4+CXCR5+HLA-DR+ stem cell memory T cells (TSCM) and decreased proportions of Granzyme-B and Perforin-expressing effector memory T cells (TEM) were detected in recovered and deceased patients, respectively. The higher abundance of polyfunctional CD8+PD-L1+CXCR3+ T effector cells, CXCR5+HLA-DR+ TSCM, as well as anti-nucleocapsid (NC) cytokine-producing T cells permitted to differentiate between recovered and deceased patients. The results from a principal component analysis showed an imbalance in the T cell compartment allowed for the separation of recovered and deceased patients. The paucity of circulating CD8+PD-L1+CXCR3+ Teff-cells and NC-specific CD8+ T-cells accurately forecasts fatal disease outcome. CONCLUSION: This study provides insight into the nature of the T cell populations involved in the control of COVID-19 and therefor might impact T cell-based vaccine designs for this infectious disease.

34229244	Contribution of rapid lateral flow assays from capillary blood specimens to the diagnosis of COVID-19 in symptomatic healthcare workers: a pilot study in a university hospital, Paris, France. BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess, by rapid tests, the immune status against COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers (HCW) with history of symptoms, and for whom SARS-CoV-2 detection was either not documented or negative. METHODS: Whole blood by finger prick and serum samples were taken from HCW for use with 2 rapid lateral flow tests and an automated immunoassay. RESULTS: Seventy-two HCWs were included, median duration between symptoms onset and serology sampling was 68 days. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected by rapid test in 11 HCW (15.3%) and confirmed in the 10 with available serum by the automated immunoassay. The frequency of ageusia or anosmia was higher in participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (P = 0.0006 and P = 0.029, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study, among symptomatic HCW during the first wave in France, showed that 15% had IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2, a higher seroprevalence than in the general population. Rapid lateral flow tests were highly concordant with automated immunoassay.	Diagnosis
34211871	The Management and Outcomes of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection in a Series of Neurosurgical Patients. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted neurosurgical practice worldwide. In Iran, hospitals have halted their routine activities, and most hospital beds have been assigned to COVID-19 patients. Here, we share our experience with 10 neurosurgical cases with confirmed COVID-19. Materials and Methods: From February 24, 2020 to April 20, 2020, we were able to obtain clinical data on ten neurosurgical patients with COVID-19 through a predefined electronic form. Results: Of the 10 patients with COVID-19 on neurosurgical units, eight underwent surgical interventions. The age of the patients ranged from 21 to 75 years and 70% were males. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on chest imaging findings and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for coronavirus and an infectious disease specialist and a pulmonologist confirmed the diagnoses. In two cases, there was a significant decrease in O2 saturation intraoperatively. Three patients in this series died during the assessment period. One death was due to respiratory failure induced by the coronavirus infection. The cause of death in other two patients was cardiovascular failure not related to COVID-19. Conclusions: We hope we can provide a reference for future studies and help develop a clearer understanding of neurosurgical practice and outcomes in patients with COVID-19. In the time of COVID-19 pandemic when dealing with neurosurgical emergencies, a conservative approach is recommended. Using committed personal protective equipment, short-time operating procedures or minimally invasive surgery must be considered in the management of emergent patients. Resuming elective surgeries need defining measures needed to ensure patients and health-care providers' safety. Reorganizing the health-care system for telemonitoring released patients can lessen hospital visits.	Prevention

34211816	Testicular Pain and Mesenteric Adenitis as an Atypical Presentation of COVID-19. A 21-year-old Caucasian male with no past medical history presented to the emergency department with right lower quadrant pain radiating to the right testicle for two days. He reported an occasional dry cough that day but denied any fever or other infectious symptoms. The patient was afebrile with a normal physical examination. CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed prominent right lower quadrant lymphadenopathy. Viral panel for common respiratory pathogens returned negative. A nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 by Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Cepheid Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) was positive. The patient remained in quarantine for 14 days. He was reevaluated seven weeks later with spontaneous resolution of his abdominal pain and the continued absence of upper respiratory symptoms. A repeat CT scan seven weeks later showed persistent mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Repeat COVID-19 testing was not performed at this time. While the frequency of atypical presentation of COVID-19 remains unknown, healthcare providers must continue to remain vigilant and consider COVID-19 as a differential diagnosis in any patient presenting to the emergency department despite the lack of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Further research is warranted to examine the possibility of asymptomatic spread in asymptomatic patients with persistent radiologic findings and to assess whether repeat COVID-19 testing is warranted in such patients.

34338124	Rhino-orbital mucormycosis following COVID-19 in previously non-diabetic, immunocompetent patients. PURPOSE: To report a series of 13 immunocompetent patients who developed new-onset uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) following COVID-19 infection and presented as rhino-orbital mucormycosis (ROM). METHOD: Retrospective study. RESULTS: A total of 127 patients of COVID-19 Associated Mucormycosis (CAM) were evaluated at four centres in India. All patients underwent endoscopic sinus debridement surgery and received systemic amphotericin-B therapy. Five patients (5/13; 38.4%) received retrobulbar amphotericin-B injections. Orbital exenteration was performed in advanced orbital involvement or progression of orbital disease in spite of maximal medical therapy. In his cohort, 13/127 (10.2%) patients presented with new onset DM, where one patient had bilateral disease. The mean age was 35.9 years (range: 20-51 years) and the mean duration from diagnosis of COVID-19 to the diagnosis of mucormycosis was 14.2 days. While 7/13 (53.8%) of the patients received systemic corticosteroids during the course of their treatment for COVID-19, six patients received no steroids or immunomodulators. The mean follow-up period was 9.2 weeks (range: 3-18 weeks) following discharge. Life salvage was possible in 100% of the cases. While overall globe salvage was possible in 42.8% (6/14 eyes), the globe could be preserved in 4/5 patients who received retrobulbar amphotericin-B injections. CONCLUSIONS: Those involved in the care of COVID-19 patients should be aware about the possibility of recent-onset DM, even in patients without a history of corticosteroid therapy. Rarely, recent-onset DM following COVID-19 may present as rhino-orbital mucormycosis, which requires aggressive surgical and medical intervention.	Diagnosis
34285535	The Prevalence and Clinical Features of Skin Irritation Caused by Infection Prevention Measures During COVID-19 in the Mecca Region, Saudi Arabia. Purpose: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, recommendations to prevent infection suggest increasing the frequency of handwashing and disinfection; however, these measures can have negative implications on our skin. This study aims to evaluate whether these measures correlate with new-onset skin damage or can exacerbate hand eczema among the general population. Materials and Methods: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional, survey-based study, including the general population of Mecca region, Saudi Arabia. To achieve the study's aim, an online questionnaire to the general population comprising 25 items was distributed via social media apps during the pandemic between October 23 and November 21, 2020. Data were automatically collected in Excel and entered into SPSS for analysis. Results: A total of 783 participants were included in this study, of whom 695 (88.8%) were female. A history of hand eczema was reported among 123 (15.7%) participants, and 270 (34.5%) had a history of atopy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 86 (13.0%) participants noticed new-onset skin irritation, while 81 (31.3%) of the participants reported exacerbation of earlier hand allergic dermatitis. The most frequent symptoms were dryness and feeling of tightness. Additionally, most participants among both groups noticed that skin lesions appeared for less than 10 days. The frequent handwashing statistically increased following the onset of the pandemic (p=0.001), there is association between new-onset symptoms and more frequent handwashing, as well as the use of hand disinfectants, during the pandemic (p=0.001). Conclusion: Our study suggests that the general population's skin was negatively affected by COVID-19 precautions, particularly those with a history of hand eczema. We recommend spreading awareness of skin protective modalities and the use of new infection prevention measures, such as regular skin moisturization for hand protection and possibly using less damaging skin disinfectants like ozonized water provided it is scientifically proven effective in disinfecting COVID-19 virus.

34217366	Effects of COVID-19 prevention procedures on other common infections: a systematic review. INTRODUCTION: Since the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) began, necessary measures to prevent virus transmission and reduce mortality have been implemented, including mandatory public use of masks, regular hand-sanitizing and hand-washing, social distancing, avoidance of crowds, remote work, and cancellation of public events. During and after the introduction of COVID-19 lockout, we performed a systematic review of available published literature to investigate the incidence of seasonal influenza and other respiratory viral infections. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Research Gate, and the World Health Organization databases and websites were systematically searched for original studies concerning the impact of COVID-19 prevention means and measures on other common respiratory infectious diseases during the pandemic published by March 2021. RESULTS: The findings showed that the adherence to health protocols to prevent COVID-19 could help to reduce the incidence of other infectious diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: The implemented prevention measures and protocols might have reduced the incidence of influenza and some other common respiratory infections. However, controversies exist on this matter and future large population-based studies might provide further information to address these controversies.	Prevention

34210524	Associations between COVID-19 transmission rates, park use, and landscape structure. The COVID-19 pandemic has had severe impacts on global public health. In England, social distancing measures and a nationwide lockdown were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus. Green space accessibility may have been particularly important during this lockdown, as it could have provided benefits for physical and mental wellbeing. However, the associations between public green space use and the rate of COVID-19 transmission are yet to be quantified, and as the size and accessibility of green spaces vary within England's local authorities, the risks and benefits to the public of using green space may be context-dependent. To evaluate how green space affected COVID-19 transmission across 299 local authorities (small regions) in England, we calculated a daily case rate metric, based upon a seven-day moving average, for each day within the period June 1st - November 30th 2020 and assessed how baseline health and mobility variables influenced these rates. Next, looking at the residual case rates, we investigated how landscape structure (e.g. area and patchiness of green space) and park use influenced transmission. We first show that reducing mobility is associated with a decline in case rates, especially in areas with high population clustering. After accounting for known mechanisms behind transmission rates, we found that park use (showing a preference for park mobility) was associated with decreased residual case rates, especially when green space was low and contiguous (not patchy). Our results support that a reduction in overall mobility may be a good strategy for reducing case rates, endorsing the success of lockdown measures. However, if mobility is necessary, outdoor park use may be safer than other forms of mobility and associated activities (e.g. shopping or office-based working).	Prevention;Transmission
34204453	Direct Comparison of Clinical Characteristics, Outcomes, and Risk Prediction in Patients with COVID-19 and Controls-A Prospective Cohort Study. Most studies investigating early risk predictors in coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) lacked comparison with controls. We aimed to assess and directly compare outcomes and risk predictors at time of emergency department (ED) presentation in COVID-19 and controls. Consecutive patients presenting to the ED with suspected COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled. COVID-19-patients were compared with (i) patients tested negative (overall controls) and (ii) patients tested negative, who had a respiratory infection (respiratory controls). Primary outcome was the composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death at 30 days. Among 1081 consecutive cases, 191 (18%) were tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 890 (82%) were tested negative (overall controls), of which 323 (30%) had a respiratory infection (respiratory controls). Incidence of the composite outcome was significantly higher in COVID-19 (23%) as compared with the overall control group (10%, adjusted-HR 2.45 (95%CI, 1.61-3.74), p < 0.001) or the respiratory control group (10%, adjusted-HR 2.93 (95%CI, 1.66-5.17), p < 0.001). Blood oxygen saturation, age, high-sensitivity troponin, c-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase were identified as the strongest predictors of poor outcome available at time of ED presentation in COVID-19 with highly comparable prognostic utility in overall and respiratory controls. In conclusion, patients presenting to the ED with COVID-19 have a worse outcome than controls, even after adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics. Most predictors of poor outcome in COVID-19 were not restricted to COVID-19, but of comparable prognostic utility in controls and therefore generalizable to unselected patients with suspected COVID-19.

34209788	Does the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor Binding Domain Interact Effectively with the DPP4 (CD26) Receptor? A Molecular Docking Study. ACE2 has been established as the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Since other human coronaviruses are known to use co-receptors for viral cell entry, it has been suggested that DPP4 (CD26) could be a potential additional binding target or co-receptor, supported by early molecular docking simulation studies. However, recent biophysical studies have shown this interaction to be very weak. We have conducted detailed molecular docking simulations to predict the potential binding interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and DPP4 and compare them with the interactions observed in the experimentally determined structure of the complex of MERS-CoV with DPP4. Whilst the overall binding mode of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to DPP4 is predicted to be similar to that observed in the MERS-CoV-DPP4 complex, including a number of equivalent interactions, important differences in the amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV result in substantially weakened interactions with DPP4. This is shown to arise from differences in the predicted proximity, nature and secondary structure at the binding interface on the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. These findings do not support DPP4 being a significant receptor for SARS-CoV-2.	Mechanism;Treatment
34373841	Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Gastroenterology Department Activity: The Gastroenterologist's Perspective Nationwide and the Real Impact in a Portuguese Center. Background: Several gastroenterology societies have created recommendations in order to reduce nonessential exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Our aim is to evaluate the national gastroenterologists' perspective on the impact of COVID-19 and the impact of reorganization of a gastroenterology department during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: For the first purpose, an online survey was distributed to gastroenterologists nationwide. For the second purpose, the authors conducted an analysis of some endoscopic procedures performed at the Gastroenterology Department of the Centro Hospitalar Vila Nova de Gaia/Espinho (CHVNG/E) between March 16 and May 8 during the years 2019 and 2020. Results: Sixty-seven gastroenterologists answered our survey. Only 14.9% were residents and 86.6% worked in a hospital with COVID-19 patients, with 16.4% assigned to assist those patients. All of the departments suffered modifications. Ninety percent of the residents affirmed that their activity had changed. Ninety-four percent declared having nonessential endoscopic procedures postponed, and 85.1% maintained in-person medical visits, 88.1% were already having remote consultations, and 11.9% did not have any clinical visit. In our gastroenterology unit, the number of endoscopic procedures decreased by 73.1% from 2019 to 2020. In 2020, the proportion of urgent procedures was higher compared to 2019. Conclusion: The advent of COVID-19 has led to important changes in gastroenterology activities in Portugal, and national gastroenterology units are complying with the recommendations. Furthermore, Portuguese gastroenterologists believed that the decrease in endoscopic activity can compromise residents' education and training. The gastroenterology department at CHVNG/E has shown a significant reduction in the number of endoscopic procedures.	Prevention
34213039	Risk of severe illness of COVID-19 patients with NAFLD and increased NAFLD fibrosis scores. BACKGROUND: There is still little knowledge about the association of liver fibrosis with the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of the study was to determine the association of NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS)-determined liver fibrosis with clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with NAFLD. METHODS: The NAFLD was diagnosed by the Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI) in the absence of other causes of chronic liver diseases. NFS was used to evaluate the severity of liver fibrosis. RESULTS: A total of 86 COVID-19 patients with NAFLD were included. The median age was 43.5 years, and 58.1% of patients were male. Thirty-eight (44.2%) patients had advanced liver fibrosis according to the NFS. Multivariate analysis indicated that concurrent diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 8.264, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.202-56.830, p = 0.032) and advanced liver fibrosis (OR 11.057, 95% CI 1.193-102.439, p = 0.034) were independent risk factors of severe illness in COVID-19 patients with NAFLD. CONCLUSION: NAFLD patients with NFS-determined advanced liver fibrosis are at higher risk of severe COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34354189	Fomites and the environment did not have an important role in COVID-19 transmission in a Brazilian mid-sized city. It is not clear if COVID-19 can be indirectly transmitted. It is not possible to conclude the role of the environment in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 without studying areas in which people transit in great numbers. In this work we aimed to better understand the role of environment in the spread of COVID-19. We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in fomites as well as in the air and in the sewage using RT-qPCR. We studied both, a reference market area and a COVID-19 reference hospital at Barreiras city, Brazil. We collected and analyzed a total of 418 samples from mask fronts, cell phones, paper money, card machines, sewage, air and bedding during the ascendant phase of the epidemiological curve of COVID-19 in Barreiras. As a result, we detected the human RNAse P gene in most of samples, which indicates the presence of human cells or their fragments in specimens. However, we did not detect any trace of SARS-CoV-2 in all samples analyzed. We conclude that, so far, the environment and inanimate materials did not have an important role in COVID-19 transmission in Barreiras city. Therefore, similar results can probably be found in other cities, mainly those with COVID-19 epidemiological scenarios similar to that of Barreiras city. Our study is a small piece indicating the possibility that fomites and the environment do not have an important role in COVID-19 transmission. However, further studies are necessary to better understand the world scenario.	Prevention;Transmission
34281084	Usage of eHealth/mHealth Services among Young Czech Adults and the Impact of COVID-19: An Explorative Survey. Various mHealth/eHealth services play an increasingly important role in healthcare systems and personal lifestyle management. Yet, the relative popularity of these services among the young population of the Czech Republic was not known. Therefore, we carried out an on-line survey with a convenience sample (n = 299) of young adults aged 18-29 and living in the Czech Republic. To this end, we adapted the survey instrument which was previously used in a similar study conducted in a different cultural context (Hong Kong). In our study, we found out that health tutorial activities (i.e., acquiring information on diet, exercise, fitness) were the most common among our respondents (M = 2.81, SD = 1.14). These were followed by health information seeking activities (i.e., acquiring information on medical problems) (M = 2.63, SD = 0.89) and medical services (i.e., the eHealth/mHealth services that provide infrastructural support, such as ePrescription and doctor appointment organizers) (M = 2.18, SD = 0.97). Based on the grouping according to gender and existing health condition, pairwise comparisons showed statistically significant differences. We also briefly analyzed the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the examined activities. Based on their relative popularity, we suggest leveraging the potential of health tutorial activities to improve public health.	Prevention
34208057	Case Series of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) in Children during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Latvia. The total number of COVID-19 positive cases in Latvia has escalated rapidly since October 2020, peaking in late December 2020 and early January 2021. Children generally develop COVID-19 more mildly than adults; however, it can be complicated by multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). This case study aims were to assess demographic characteristics and the underlying medical conditions, and clinical, investigative and treatment data among 13 MIS-C patients using electronic medical records. All 13 had acute illness or contact with someone who was COVID-19 positive two to six weeks before MIS-C onset. Only five of the 13 were symptomatic during the acute COVID-19 phase. The median age was 8.8 years; 11/13 patients were male, 10/13 had been previously healthy, and all 13 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or antibody testing. The most commonly involved organ systems were the gastrointestinal (13/13), hematologic (13/13), cardiovascular (13/13), skin and mucosa (13/13), and respiratory (12/13) ones. The median hospital stay was 13 (interquartile range, 11 to 18) days; 7/13 patients received intensive care, 6/13 oxygen support, and 5/13 received inotropic support. No deaths occurred. During the current pandemic, every child with a fever should have a clearly defined epidemiological history of COVID-19, a careful clinical assessment of possible multiple organ-system involvement, with a special focus on children with severe abdominal pain and/or skin and mucocutaneous lesions.

34226836	A multi-class COVID-19 segmentation network with pyramid attention and edge loss in CT images. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus COVID-19 broke out. Due to its high contagiousness, more than 74 million people have been infected worldwide. Automatic segmentation of the COVID-19 lesion area in CT images is an effective auxiliary medical technology which can quantitatively diagnose and judge the severity of the disease. In this paper, a multi-class COVID-19 CT image segmentation network is proposed, which includes a pyramid attention module to extract multi-scale contextual attention information, and a residual convolution module to improve the discriminative ability of the network. A wavelet edge loss function is also proposed to extract edge features of the lesion area to improve the segmentation accuracy. For the experiment, a dataset of 4369 CT slices is constructed, including three symptoms: ground glass opacities, interstitial infiltrates, and lung consolidation. The dice similarity coefficients of three symptoms of the model achieve 0.7704, 0.7900, 0.8241 respectively. The performance of the proposed network on public dataset COVID-SemiSeg is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that this model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and can be a powerful tool to assist in the diagnosis of positive infection cases, and promote the development of intelligent technology in the medical field.

34208529	COVID Obesity: A One-Year Narrative Review. On 11 March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). This study focuses on a narrative review about the illness during the first year of the pandemic in relation to obesity. Databases were used to search studies published up to 8 December 2020. In total, 4430 articles and other scientific literature were found, and 24 articles were included in this one-year narrative review. The mean BMI value of severe COVID-19 patients ranged from 24.5 to 33.4 kg/m(2), versus <18.5 to 24.3 kg/m(2) for non-severe patients. Articles using the terms obesity or overweight without indicating the BMI value in these patients were common, but this is not useful, as the anthropometric parameters, when not defined by this index, are confusing due to the classification being different in the West compared to among Asian and Korean criteria-based adults. We proposed a new term, called COVID obesity, to define the importance of this anthropometric parameter, among others, in relation with this pandemic.	Diagnosis
34292929	Automated Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Data Analysis for Sars-CoV-2 Detection. BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a current public health concern. Rapid diagnosis is crucial, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is presently the reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. OBJECTIVE: Automated RT-PCR analysis (ARPA) is a software designed to analyze RT-PCR data for SARSCoV-2 detection. ARPA loads the RT-PCR data, classifies each sample by assessing its amplification curve behavior, evaluates the experiment's quality, and generates reports. METHODS: ARPA was implemented in the R language and deployed as a Shiny application. We evaluated the performance of ARPA in 140 samples. The samples were manually classified and automatically analyzed using ARPA. RESULTS: ARPA had a true-positive rate = 1, true-negative rate = 0.98, positive-predictive value = 0.95, and negative-predictive value = 1, with 36 samples correctly classified as positive, 100 samples correctly classified as negative, and two samples classified as positive even when labeled as negative by manual inspection. Two samples were labeled as invalid by ARPA and were not considered in the performance metrics calculation. CONCLUSIONS: ARPA is a sensitive and specific software that facilitates the analysis of RT-PCR data, and its implementation can reduce the time required in the diagnostic pipeline.	Diagnosis
34221854	Time series forecasting of new cases and new deaths rate for COVID-19 using deep learning methods. The first known case of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in December 2019. It has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic, imposed restrictions and costs to many countries. Predicting the number of new cases and deaths during this period can be a useful step in predicting the costs and facilities required in the future. The purpose of this study is to predict new cases and deaths rate one, three and seven-day ahead during the next 100 days. The motivation for predicting every n days (instead of just every day) is the investigation of the possibility of computational cost reduction and still achieving reasonable performance. Such a scenario may be encountered in real-time forecasting of time series. Six different deep learning methods are examined on the data adopted from the WHO website. Three methods are LSTM, Convolutional LSTM, and GRU. The bidirectional extension is then considered for each method to forecast the rate of new cases and new deaths in Australia and Iran countries. This study is novel as it carries out a comprehensive evaluation of the aforementioned three deep learning methods and their bidirectional extensions to perform prediction on COVID-19 new cases and new death rate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Bi-GRU and Bi-Conv-LSTM models are used for prediction on COVID-19 new cases and new deaths time series. The evaluation of the methods is presented in the form of graphs and Friedman statistical test. The results show that the bidirectional models have lower errors than other models. A several error evaluation metrics are presented to compare all models, and finally, the superiority of bidirectional methods is determined. This research could be useful for organisations working against COVID-19 and determining their long-term plans.	Epidemic Forecasting
34209213	Emerging Evidence for Pleiotropism of Eosinophils. Eosinophils are complex granulocytes with the capacity to react upon diverse stimuli due to their numerous and variable surface receptors, which allows them to respond in very different manners. Traditionally believed to be only part of parasitic and allergic/asthmatic immune responses, as scientific studies arise, the paradigm about these cells is continuously changing, adding layers of complexity to their roles in homeostasis and disease. Developing principally in the bone marrow by the action of IL-5 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF, eosinophils migrate from the blood to very different organs, performing multiple functions in tissue homeostasis as in the gastrointestinal tract, thymus, uterus, mammary glands, liver, and skeletal muscle. In organs such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, eosinophils are able to act as immune regulatory cells and also to perform direct actions against parasites, and bacteria, where novel mechanisms of immune defense as extracellular DNA traps are key factors. Besides, eosinophils, are of importance in an effective response against viral pathogens by their nuclease enzymatic activity and have been lately described as involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 immunity. The pleiotropic role of eosinophils is sustained because eosinophils can be also detrimental to human physiology, for example, in diseases like allergies, asthma, and eosinophilic esophagitis, where exosomes can be significant pathophysiologic units. These eosinophilic pathologies, require specific treatments by eosinophils control, such as new monoclonal antibodies like mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab. In this review, we describe the roles of eosinophils as effectors and regulatory cells and their involvement in pathological disorders and treatment.	Mechanism;Treatment
34358135	Signatures of the Venezuelan Humanitarian Crisis in the First Wave of COVID-19: Fuel Shortages and Border Migration. Testing and isolation have been crucial for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Venezuela has one of the weakest testing infrastructures in Latin America and the low number of reported cases in the country has been attributed to substantial underreporting. However, the Venezuelan epidemic seems to have lagged behind other countries in the region, with most cases occurring within the capital region and four border states. Here, we describe the spatial epidemiology of COVID-19 in Venezuela and its relation to the population mobility, migration patterns, non-pharmaceutical interventions and fuel availability that impact population movement. Using a metapopulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, we explore how movement patterns could have driven the observed distribution of cases. Low within-country connectivity most likely delayed the onset of the epidemic in most states, except for those bordering Colombia and Brazil, where high immigration seeded outbreaks. NPIs slowed early epidemic growth and subsequent fuel shortages appeared to be responsible for limiting the spread of COVID-19 across the country.	Prevention
34293609	Rapid determination of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in PCR-positive samples by SDS-PMA assisted RT-qPCR. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has generated a global health crisis that needs well management of not only patients but also environments to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The gold standard RT-qPCR method is sensitive and rapid to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but does not answer if PCR-positive samples contain infectious virions. To circumvent this problem, we report an SDS-propidium monoazide (PMA) assisted RT-qPCR method that enables rapid discrimination of live and dead SARS-CoV-2 within 3 h. PMA, a photo-reactive dye, can react with viral RNA released or inside inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions under assistance of 0.005% SDS, but not viral RNA inside live virions. Formation of PMA-RNA conjugates prevents PCR amplification, leaving only infectious virions to be detected. Under optimum conditions, RT-qPCR detection of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 resulted in larger than 9 Ct value differences between PMA-treated and PMA-free groups, while less than 0.5 Ct differences were observed in the detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 ranging from 20 to 5148 viral particles. Using a cutoff Ct difference of 8.6, this method could differentiate as low as 8 PFU live viruses in the mixtures of live and heat-inactivated virions. Further experiments showed that this method could successfully monitor the natural inactivation process of SARS-CoV-2 on plastic surfaces during storage with comparable results to the gold standard plaque assay. We believe that the culture-free method established here could be used for rapid and convenient determination of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions in PCR-positive samples, which will facilitate better control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

34216296	Current Understanding of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) Following COVID-19 and Its Distinction from Kawasaki Disease. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, I have reviewed current reports that explore differences and similarities between multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and other known multisystem inflammatory diseases seen in children, particularly Kawasaki disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a human coronavirus causing the COVID-19 disease which emerged in China in December 2019 and spread rapidly to the entire country and quickly to other countries. Currently, there is a pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection that results in 20% of patients admitted to hospital with illness, with 3% developing intractable acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high mortality. However, pediatric COVID-19 is still reported to be a mild disease, affecting only 8% of children. Pathogenesis in children is comparable to adults. There are suggested impaired activation of IFN-alpha and IFN regulator 3, decreased cell response causing impaired viral defense, yet the clinical course is mild, and almost all children recover from the infection without major complications. Interestingly, there is a subset of patients that develop a late but marked immunogenic response to COVID-19 and develop MIS-C. Clinical features of MIS-C resemble certain pediatric rheumatologic diseases, such as Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) which affects small-medium vessels. Other features of MIS-C resemble those of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). However, recent research suggests distinct clinical and laboratory differences between MIS-C, Kawasaki disease, and MAS. Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, MIS-C has become the candidate for the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
34340949	COVID-19 positivity rates, hospitalizations and mortality of adults with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities in Ontario, Canada. BACKGROUND: Across and within countries there is a need to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted populations of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). OBJECTIVE: Rates of COVID-19 positivity for adults with IDD, including Down syndrome, relative to adults without IDD in Ontario, Canada were compared. Health profiles and case-based rates of hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mortality within 30 days of testing positively were compared for those with IDD, including Down syndrome, versus those without IDD. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study linked health administrative databases using unique encoded identifiers to describe population-level COVID-19 positivity, related hospital use and mortality from January 15, 2020 to January 10, 2021. Incidence rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Relative to adults without IDD, COVID-19 positivity rates were 1.28 times higher for adults with IDD and 1.42 times higher for adults with Down syndrome. Compared to adults without IDD, adults with IDD were more than twice as likely to be hospitalized following COVID-19 (RR:2.21 (95%CI: 1.93,2.54)) and to die (RR:2.23 (95%CI: 1.86,2.67). These RRs were greater for adults under 65. For adults with Down syndrome, mortality rates were 6.59 (95%CI: 4.51,9.62) times higher than those without IDD. DISCUSSION: In Ontario, Canada, hospitalization and mortality rates associated with COVID-19 are higher for adults with IDD than other adults. These findings should inform vaccination strategies that often prioritize older adults in the general population resulting in people with IDD, who are often in younger age groups, being overlooked.

34216613	Impact of sewer overflow on public health: A comprehensive scientometric analysis and systematic review. Sewer overflow (SO), which has attracted global attention, poses serious threat to public health and ecosystem. SO impacts public health via consumption of contaminated drinking water, aerosolization of pathogens, food-chain transmission, and direct contact with fecally-polluted rivers and beach sediments during recreation. However, no study has attempted to map the linkage between SO and public health including Covid-19 using scientometric analysis and systematic review of literature. Results showed that only few countries were actively involved in SO research in relation to public health. Furthermore, there are renewed calls to scale up environmental surveillance to safeguard public health. To safeguard public health, it is important for public health authorities to optimize water and wastewater treatment plants and improve building ventilation and plumbing systems to minimize pathogen transmission within buildings and transportation systems. In addition, health authorities should formulate appropriate policies that can enhance environmental surveillance and facilitate real-time monitoring of sewer overflow. Increased public awareness on strict personal hygiene and point-of-use-water-treatment such as boiling drinking water will go a long way to safeguard public health. Ecotoxicological studies and health risk assessment of exposure to pathogens via different transmission routes is also required to appropriately inform the use of lockdowns, minimize their socio-economic impact and guide evidence-based welfare/social policy interventions. Soft infrastructures, optimized sewer maintenance and prescreening of sewer overflow are recommended to reduce stormwater burden on wastewater treatment plant, curtail pathogen transmission and marine plastic pollution. Comprehensive, integrated surveillance and global collaborative efforts are important to curtail on-going Covid-19 pandemic and improve resilience against future pandemics.	Prevention;Transmission
34204934	Characteristics and Survival of Intensive Care Unit Patients with Coronavirus Disease in Osaka, Japan: A Retrospective Observational Study. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) have not been adequately evaluated in Japan. We analyzed the registry data of 205 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU between February and November 2020, in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association between epidemiological factors and mortality among ICU patients. Of the 205 ICU patients, 161 (78.5%) were men and 149 (72.7%) were older than 60 years. A total of 117 patients (57.1%) had comorbidities. The most common symptoms at diagnosis were mild (n = 131, 63.9%). A total of 187 patients (91.2%) received mechanical ventilation, and 32 patients (15.6%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Patients were followed up for a median of 25 days after ICU admission. A total of 147 patients (71.7%) were alive at discharge, and 58 patients (28.3%) died. The hazard ratio for mortality among patients aged >80 years was 6.02 (95% confidence interval: 2.10-17.25) in the multivariable model, which was higher than that among those aged </=59 years. These results are useful for recognizing the clinical course of this infection in ICU patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34220401	State of the art in nonthermal plasma processing for biomedical applications: Can it help fight viral pandemics like COVID-19? Plasma processing finds widespread biomedical applications, such as the design of biosensors, antibiofouling surfaces, controlled drug delivery systems, and in plasma sterilizers. In the present coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation, the prospect of applying plasma processes like surface activation, plasma grafting, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition/plasma polymerization, surface etching, plasma immersion ion implantation, crosslinking, and plasma decontamination to provide timely solutions in the form of better antiviral alternatives, practical diagnostic tools, and reusable personal protective equipment is worth exploring. Herein, the role of nonthermal plasmas and their contributions toward healthcare are timely reviewed to engage different communities in assisting healthcare associates and clinicians, not only to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic but also to prevent similar kinds of future outbreaks.

34216270	Implementation of lung ultrasound in low- to middle-income countries: a new challenge global health? Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death globally in children under the age of five. The poorest children are the ones most at risk of dying. In the recent years, lung ultrasound has been widely documented as a safe and easy tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of pneumonia and several other respiratory infections and diseases. During the pandemic, it played a primary role to achieve early suspicion and prediction of severe COVID-19, reducing the risk of exposure of healthcare workers to positive patients. However, innovations that can improve diagnosis and treatment allocation, saving hundreds of thousands of lives each year, are not reaching those who need them most. In this paper, we discuss advantages and limits of different tools for the diagnosis of pneumonia in low- to middle-income countries, highlighting potential benefits of a wider access to lung ultrasound in these settings and barriers to its implementation, calling international organizations to ensure the indiscriminate access, quality, and sustainability of the provision of ultrasound services in every setting.

34212838	Neutralising capacity against Delta (B.1.617.2) and other variants of concern following Comirnaty (BNT162b2, BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccination in health care workers, Israel. SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant of concern (VOC) and other VOCs are spreading in Europe. Micro-neutralisation assays with sera obtained after Comirnaty (BNT162b2, BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccination in 36 healthcare workers (31 female) demonstrated significant fold change reduction in neutralising titres compared with the original virus: Gamma (P.1) 2.3, Beta (B.1.351) 10.4, Delta 2.1 and 2.6. The reduction of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant was not significant. Despite being lower, remaining neutralisation capacity conferred by Comirnaty against Delta and other VOCs is probably protective.

34217923	Insilico study on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 RBD hotspot mutants' interaction with ACE2 to understand the binding affinity and stability. The fall of 2020 brought several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating across the globe, and the steadily increasing COVID-19 cases are responsible for the emergence of these variants. All the SARS-CoV-2 variants reported to date have multiple mutations in the spike (S) protein, specifically in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Here, we employed an integrated computational approach involving structure and sequence based predictions to study the effect of naturally occurring variations in the S-RBD on its stability and ACE2 binding affinity. The hotspot stabilizing residue mutations N501I, N501Y, Q493L, Q493H and K417R, strengthen the RBD-ACE2 complex by modulating the interaction statistics at the interface. Thus, we report here some critical mutations that could increase the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2, increasing the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Understanding the effect of these mutations will help in developing potential vaccines and therapeutics.	Mechanism;Treatment
34293137	Placental expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection: are placental defenses mediated by fetal sex? BACKGROUND: Sex differences in vulnerability to and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described in non-pregnant populations. ACE2 and TMPRSS2, host molecules required for viral entry, are regulated by sex steroids and expressed in the placenta. We sought to investigate whether placental ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression vary by fetal sex and in the presence of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Placental ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were quantified in 68 pregnant individuals (38 SARS-CoV-2 positive, 30 SARS-CoV-2 negative) delivering at Mass General Brigham from April to June 2020. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 status was determined by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. Placental SARS-CoV-2 viral load was quantified. RTqPCR was performed to quantify expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 relative to the reference gene YWHAZ. Western blots were performed on placental homogenates to quantify protein levels. The impact of fetal sex and SARS-CoV-2 exposure on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 virus was undetectable in all placentas. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection impacted TMPRSS2 placental gene and protein expression in a sexually dimorphic fashion (2-way ANOVA interaction p-value: 0.002). We observed no impact of fetal sex or maternal SARS-CoV-2 status on placental ACE2 gene or protein expression. Placental TMPRSS2 expression was significantly correlated with ACE2 expression in males (Spearman's rho=0.54, p=0.02) but not females (rho=0.23, p=0.34) exposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Sex differences in placental TMPRSS2 but not ACE2 were observed in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings may have implications for offspring vulnerability to placental infection.	Mechanism;Treatment
34366689	Artificial intelligence: Potential tool to subside SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI), a method of simulating the human brain in order to complete tasks in a more effective manner, has had numerous implementations in fields from manufacturing sectors to digital electronics. Despite the potential of AI, it may be obstinate to assume that the person administered society would rely solely on AI; with an example being the healthcare field. With the ever-expanding discoveries made on a regular basis regarding the growth of various diseases and its preservations, utilizing brain power may be deemed essential, but that doesn't leave AI as a redundant asset. With the years of accumulated data regarding patterns and the analysis of various medical circumstances, algorithms can be formed, which could further assist in situations such as diagnosis support and population health management. This matter becomes even more relevant in today's society with the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by SARS-CoV-2. With the uncertainty of this pandemic from strain variants to the rolling speeds of vaccines, AI could be utilized to our advantage in order to assist us with the fight against COVID-19. This review briefly discusses the application of AI in the COVID-19 situation for various health benefits.	Diagnosis
34208118	Characterization of Fed Cattle Mobility during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic had significant consequences on cattle slaughter capacity in the United States. Although industry stakeholders implemented strategies to minimize cattle welfare impacts of increased weights, days on feed (DOF), and increasing temperatures, there were concerns that mobility challenges would be observed at slaughter facilities. The objectives of this study were to characterize mobility in fed cattle during this recovery period and to identify factors impacting mobility. A total of 158 groups of cattle (15,388 animals) from one slaughter facility were included in the study. A 4-point mobility scoring system was used to assess cattle mobility. Cattle at the facility with normal mobility scores were reduced from the historical average of 96.19% to 74.55%. No increase in highly elevated mobility scores was observed. Mobility was impacted by weight, temperature humidity index (THI), distance hauled, sex, and DOF, with results differing by mobility category. Weather was a key contributor to mobility challenges; the relative risk of observing an elevated mobility score was 45.76% greater when the THI changed from No Stress to Mild Stress. Despite the challenges that the industry faced during this period, efforts to minimize negative effects on cattle welfare by enhanced focus on low-stress handling were effective.	Prevention
34282608	Respiratory Protection Effect of Ear-loop-type KF94 Masks according to the Wearing Method in COVID-19 Pandemic: a Randomized, Open-label Study. BACKGROUND: Ear-loop-type Korean Filter 94 masks (KF94 masks, equivalent to the N95 and FFP2) are broadly used in health care settings in Korea for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: A prospective randomized open-label study was designed to identify differences in the fitting performance between mask wearing methods in three different types of KF94 mask with ear loops between January to March 2021. General-fitting involved wearing an ear-loop-type KF94 mask, and tight-fitting involved wearing a mask aided by a clip connecting the ear loops. Each of the 30 participants wore three types of masks according to a randomly assigned order in both methods and performed a total of six quantitative fit tests (QNFTs) according to the occupational safety and health administration protocol. RESULTS: All fit factors (FFs) measured by the QNFT were significantly higher for tight-fitting method with the clip in all KF94 masks (P < 0.001). However, the total FFs were very low, with a median (interquartile range) of 6 (3-23) and 29 (9-116) for general-fitting and tight-fitting, respectively. When wearing tightly, the horizontal 3-fold type mask with adjustable ear-loop length had the highest FF, with a median of 125, and the QNFT pass rate (FF >/= 100) increased significantly from 4 (13%) to 18 (60%). CONCLUSION: Even with sufficient filter efficiency, ear-loop-type-KF94 masks do not provide adequate protection. However, in relatively low-risk environments, wearing a face-seal adjustable KF94 mask and tight wearing with a clip can improve respiratory protection for healthcare workers.

34366234	The association of ABO blood group with the asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in India. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in multiple waves of infection worldwide. The large variations in case fatality rate among different geographical regions suggest that the human susceptibility against this virus varies substantially. Several studies from different parts of the world showed a significant association of ABO blood group and COVID-19 susceptibility. It was demonstrated that individuals with blood group O are at the lower risk of coronavirus infection. To establish the association of ABO blood group in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, we for the first time analysed SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies among 509 individuals, collected from three major districts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh region of India. Interestingly, we found neutralising antibodies in a significantly higher percentage of people with blood group AB (0.36) followed by B (0.31), A (0.22) and lowest in people with blood group O (0.11). We further estimated that people with blood group AB are at comparatively higher risk of infection than other blood groups. Thus, among the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 recovered people blood group AB has highest, whilst individuals with blood group O has lowest risk of infection.	Diagnosis
34227102	Prioritizing pregnant women for COVID-19 vaccination. Despite emerging evidence on safety and efficacy, most countries do not offer COVID-19 vaccines to pregnant women even though they are at higher risk of complications from COVID-19. We performed a web search of COVID-19 vaccination policies for pregnant women under two categories: countries bearing a high burden of COVID-19 cases and countries with a high burden of maternal and under-five mortality. Of the top 20 countries affected by COVID-19, 11 allow vaccination of pregnant women, of which two have deemed it safe to vaccinate pregnant women as a high-risk group. In contrast, only five of the 20 countries with high under-five mortality and maternal mortality allow vaccination of pregnant women and none of these countries has included them as part of a high-risk group that should be vaccinated. India and Indonesia, with one-fifth of the world's population, fall under both categories but do not include pregnant women as a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. To prevent COVID-19 from further aggravating the already heavy burden of maternal and under-five mortality, there is a strong case for including pregnant women as a high-priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. We recommend including COVID-19 vaccination in routine antenatal care in all countries, particularly India and Indonesia in view of their high dual burden.	Treatment
34216759	"Acute graft-versus-host disease after liver transplantation in a close contact with COVID-19: A case report. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a rare complication after liver transplantation that characterized by high mortality. We presented a case of aGVHD after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient suffered from fever, oral ulcer, rashes and diarrhea and had a co-infection with Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Short tandem repeat (STR) analysis for cluster of differentiation (CD3) cells and skin biopsy indicated aGVHD. His regimens included high dose of steroids, ruxolitinib, basiliximab, local liver radiotherapy and antibiotics prophylaxis, with the withdrawal of tacrolimus and MMF. Unfortunately, he developed an acute rejection followed by cytomegalovirus infection and lung infection. Soon afterwards he was sent to ""isolation ward"" due to high suspicion for clinical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Fortunately, He was excluded from COVID-19 after nucleic acid and antibody tests. Though closely contact with other COVID-19 patients for a month, the patient was not affected with COVID-19 through his careful protective measures. Finally, the patient recovered after antiviral and antifungal treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient recovered from aGVHD as a close contact."	Case Report
34291001	How is the iceberg of COVID-19? Results from a rapid literature review. Background: Given the various reports of the clinical spectrum of the disease, the aim of the present study was to determine possible scenarios of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) iceberg using published articles. Methods: The present study was a rapid review of all international databases, including PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Web of Sciences, Embase, and Cochrane Library from January 1 to October 30, 2020. Results: In this review, 7 scenarios were considered for COVID-19 iceberg, in which the range of fatality percentage was estimated to be 0.5% to 7%, the range of asymptomatic cases 1% to 88.6%, the range of cases with mild symptoms 8% to 78%, no symptoms 1 % to 90 %, the range of intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 0.5% to 14.2%, and finally the intubation percentage was estimated to be 0.2% to 12.2%. The Scenarios Diamond Princess Cruise Ship and Iceland are closer to the reality of the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 around the world, which represent 0.6% and 0.5% of deaths, 0.7% and 1% of intubations, 2.5% and 9.7% of ICU admissions, 1.1% and 6% of hospitalizations, 15% and 31% of cases with mild symptoms, and finally 56.9% and 75% of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19, respectively, which should now be considered as the basis of the clinical knowledge of the disease. Conclusion: Understanding the clinical spectrum and natural knowledge of the disease and paying attention to asymptomatic or mild-symptom cases can help to make better decisions and develop more effective interventions to control COVID-19.

34380133	First-Dose Coronavirus 2019 Vaccination Coverage among the Residents of Long-Term Care Facilities in France. BACKGROUND: Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) experienced severe burden from the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is a major issue for their residents. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the vaccination coverage rate among the residents of French LTCFs. METHOD: Participants and settings: 53 medical coordinators surveyed 73 LTCFs during the first-dose vaccination campaign using the BNT162b2 vaccine, conducted by health authorities in January and early February 2021. MEASUREMENTS: in all the residents being in the LTCF at the beginning of the campaign, investigators recorded age, sex, history of clinical or asymptomatic COVID-19, serology for SARS-CoV-2 or severe allergy, current end-of-life situation, infectious or acute disease, refusal of vaccination by the resident or by the representative person of vaccine, and the final status, vaccinated or not. RESULTS: Among the 4,808 residents, the average coverage rate for COVID-19 vaccination was 69%, and 46% of the LTCFs had a coverage rate <70%. Among unvaccinated residents, we observed more frequently a history of COVID-19 or a positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 (44.6 vs. 11.2% among vaccinated residents, p < 0.001), a history of severe allergy (3.7 vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001), end-of-life situation (4.9 vs. 0.3%, p < 0.001), current infectious or acute illness (19.6 vs. 0.3%, p < 0.001), and refusal of vaccination by residents or representative persons (38.9 vs. 0.4%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: About 3 out of 10 residents remained unvaccinated, and half of the LTCFs had a coverage rate <70%. This suggests that COVID-19 will remain a threat to many LTCFs after the vaccination campaigns.	Treatment;Prevention
34219502	Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Trauma Encounters. OBJECTIVES: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic has affected the health care system significantly. We compare 2019 to 2020 to evaluate how trauma encounters has changed during the pandemic. METHODS: Retrospective analysis using a large US health care system to compare trauma demographics, volumes, mechanisms of injury, and outcomes. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate for significant differences comparing 2019 to 2020. RESULTS: Data was collected from 88 hospitals across 18 states. 169 892 patients were included in the study. There were 6.3% fewer trauma patient encounters in 2020 compared to 2019. Mechanism of injury was significantly different between 2019 and 2020 with less blunt injuries (89.64% vs. 88.39%, P < .001), more burn injuries (1.84% vs. 2.00%, P = .021), and more penetrating injuries (8.58% vs. 9.75%, P < .001). Compared to 2019, patients in 2020 had higher mortality (2.62% vs. 2.88%, P < .001), and longer hospital LOS (3.92 +/- 6.90 vs. 4.06 +/- 6.56, P < .001). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected trauma patient demographics, LOS, mechanism of injury, and mortality.	Prevention
34226882	Prediction model for the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in the global environment. COVID-19 has long become a worldwide pandemic. It is responsible for the death of over two million people and posed an economic recession. This paper studies the spread pattern of COVID-19, aiming to establish a prediction model for this event. We harness Data Mining and Machine Learning methodologies to train regression models to predict the number of confirmed cases in a spatial-temporal space. We introduce an innovative concept the Center of Infection Mass (CoIM) adapted from the field of physics. We empirically evaluated our model on western European countries, based on the CoIM index and other features, and showed that a relatively high accurate prediction of the spread can be obtained. Our contribution is twofold: first, we introduced a prediction methodology and proved empirically that a prediction can be made even to the range of over a month; second, we showed promise in adopting the CoIM index to prediction models, when models that adopt the CoIM yield significantly better results than those that discard it. By applying our model, and better controlling the inherent tradeoff between life-saving and economy, we believe that decision-makers can take close to optimal measures. Thus, this methodology may contribute to public welfare.	Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34203261	Imatinib (STI571) Inhibits the Expression of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 and Cell Entry of the SARS-CoV-2-Derived Pseudotyped Viral Particles. A group of clinically approved cancer therapeutic tyrosine kinase inhibitors was screened to test their effects on the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (also known as STI571, Gleevec) can inhibit the expression of the endogenous ACE2 gene at both the transcript and protein levels. Treatment with imatinib resulted in inhibition of cell entry of the viral pseudoparticles (Vpps) in cell culture. In FVB mice orally fed imatinib, tissue expression of ACE2 was reduced, specifically in the lungs and renal tubules, but not in the parenchyma of other organs such as the heart and intestine. Our finding suggests that receptor tyrosine kinases play a role in COVID-19 infection and can be therapeutic targets with combined treatments of the best conventional care of COVID-19.

34286302	Generating hard-to-obtain information from easy-to-obtain information: Applications in drug discovery and clinical inference. Often when biological entities are measured in multiple ways, there are distinct categories of information: some information is easy-to-obtain information (EI) and can be gathered on virtually every subject of interest, while other information is hard-to-obtain information (HI) and can only be gathered on some. We propose building a model to make probabilistic predictions of HI using EI. Our feature mapping GAN (FMGAN), based on the conditional GAN framework, uses an embedding network to process conditions as part of the conditional GAN training to create manifold structure when it is not readily present in the conditions. We experiment on generating RNA sequencing of cell lines perturbed with a drug conditioned on the drug's chemical structure and generating FACS data from clinical monitoring variables on a cohort of COVID-19 patients, effectively describing their immune response in great detail.

34289752	Supervised Molecular Dynamics (SuMD) Insights into the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor PF-07321332. The chemical structure of PF-07321332, the first orally available Covid-19 clinical candidate, has recently been revealed by Pfizer. No information has been provided about the interaction pattern between PF-07321332 and its biomolecular counterpart, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)). In the present work, we exploited Supervised Molecular Dynamics (SuMD) simulations to elucidate the key features that characterise the interaction between this drug candidate and the protease, emphasising similarities and differences with other structurally related inhibitors such as Boceprevir and PF-07304814. The structural insights provided by SuMD will hopefully be able to inspire the rational discovery of other potent and selective protease inhibitors.	Mechanism;Treatment
34211983	Differential Diagnosis of COVID-19 Pneumonia From Influenza A (H1N1) Pneumonia Using a Model Based on Clinicoradiologic Features. Objectives: Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia are highly contagious diseases. We aimed to characterize initial computed tomography (CT) and clinical features and to develop a model for differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from H1N1 pneumonia. Methods: In total, we enrolled 291 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from January 20 to February 13, 2020, and 97 patients with H1N1 pneumonia from May 24, 2009, to January 29, 2010 from two hospitals. Patients were randomly grouped into a primary cohort and a validation cohort using a seven-to-three ratio, and their clinicoradiologic data on admission were compared. The clinicoradiologic features were optimized by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression analysis to generate a model for differential diagnosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for assessing the performance of the model in the primary and validation cohorts. Results: The COVID-19 pneumonia mainly presented a peripheral distribution pattern (262/291, 90.0%); in contrast, H1N1 pneumonia most commonly presented a peribronchovascular distribution pattern (52/97, 53.6%). In LASSO logistic regression, peripheral distribution patterns, older age, low-grade fever, and slightly elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, whereas, a peribronchovascular distribution pattern, centrilobular nodule or tree-in-bud sign, consolidation, bronchial wall thickening or bronchiectasis, younger age, hyperpyrexia, and a higher level of AST were associated with H1N1 pneumonia. For the primary and validation cohorts, the LASSO model containing above eight clinicoradiologic features yielded an area under curve (AUC) of 0.963 and 0.943, with sensitivity of 89.7 and 86.2%, specificity of 89.7 and 89.7%, and accuracy of 89.7 and 87.1%, respectively. Conclusions: Combination of distribution pattern and category of pulmonary opacity on chest CT with clinical features facilitates the differentiation of COVID-19 pneumonia from H1N1 pneumonia.

34224257	Association Between Caseload Surge and COVID-19 Survival in 558 U.S. Hospitals, March to August 2020. BACKGROUND: Several U.S. hospitals had surges in COVID-19 caseload, but their effect on COVID-19 survival rates remains unclear, especially independent of temporal changes in survival. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between hospitals' severity-weighted COVID-19 caseload and COVID-19 mortality risk and identify effect modifiers of this relationship. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04688372). SETTING: 558 U.S. hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database. PARTICIPANTS: Adult COVID-19-coded inpatients admitted from March to August 2020 with discharge dispositions by October 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Each hospital-month was stratified by percentile rank on a surge index (a severity-weighted measure of COVID-19 caseload relative to pre-COVID-19 bed capacity). The effect of surge index on risk-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of in-hospital mortality or discharge to hospice was calculated using hierarchical modeling; interaction by surge attributes was assessed. RESULTS: Of 144 116 inpatients with COVID-19 at 558 U.S. hospitals, 78 144 (54.2%) were admitted to hospitals in the top surge index decile. Overall, 25 344 (17.6%) died; crude COVID-19 mortality decreased over time across all surge index strata. However, compared with nonsurging (<50th surge index percentile) hospital-months, aORs in the 50th to 75th, 75th to 90th, 90th to 95th, 95th to 99th, and greater than 99th percentiles were 1.11 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.23), 1.24 (CI, 1.12 to 1.38), 1.42 (CI, 1.27 to 1.60), 1.59 (CI, 1.41 to 1.80), and 2.00 (CI, 1.69 to 2.38), respectively. The surge index was associated with mortality across ward, intensive care unit, and intubated patients. The surge-mortality relationship was stronger in June to August than in March to May (slope difference, 0.10 [CI, 0.033 to 0.16]) despite greater corticosteroid use and more judicious intubation during later and higher-surging months. Nearly 1 in 4 COVID-19 deaths (5868 [CI, 3584 to 8171]; 23.2%) was potentially attributable to hospitals strained by surging caseload. LIMITATION: Residual confounding. CONCLUSION: Despite improvements in COVID-19 survival between March and August 2020, surges in hospital COVID-19 caseload remained detrimental to survival and potentially eroded benefits gained from emerging treatments. Bolstering preventive measures and supporting surging hospitals will save many lives.

34212840	Benefits and risks associated with different uses of the COVID-19 vaccine Vaxzevria: a modelling study, France, May to September 2021. Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS) has been identified as a rare adverse event following COVID-19 vaccination with Vaxzevria. We modelled the benefits and risks of Vaxzevria distribution from May to September 2021 in metropolitan France where other vaccines are available, considering French hospitalisation data and European data on TTS. Across different scenarios, benefits of Vaxzevria distribution in people 55 years and older exceeded the risk of death from COVID-19. In young adults, risks were at least of similar magnitude as benefits.	Treatment
34209870	Modulation of Gut Microbiota for the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19. The gut microbiota is well known to exert multiple benefits on human health including protection from disease causing pathobiont microbes. It has been recognized that healthy intestinal microbiota is of great importance in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Gut dysbiosis caused by various reasons is associated with severe COVID-19. Therefore, the modulation of gut microbiota and supplementation of commensal bacterial metabolites could reduce the severity of COVID-19. Many approaches have been studied to improve gut microbiota in COVID-19 including probiotics, bacterial metabolites, and prebiotics, as well as nutraceuticals and trace elements. So far, 19 clinical trials for testing the efficacy of probiotics and synbiotics in COVID-19 prevention and treatment are ongoing. In this narrative review, we summarize the effects of various approaches on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and discuss associated mechanisms.	Treatment;Mechanism
34198715	SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Health Workers: Analysis from Verona SIEROEPID Study during the Pre-Vaccination Era. BACKGROUND: To report the baseline phase of the SIEROEPID study on SARS-CoV-2 infection seroprevalence among health workers at the University Hospital of Verona, Italy, between spring and fall 2020; to compare performances of several laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. METHODS: 5299 voluntary health workers were enrolled from 28 April 2020 to 28 July 2020 to assess immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout IgM, IgG and IgA serum levels titration by four laboratory tests. Association of antibody titre with several demographic variables, swab tests and performance tests (sensitivity, specificity, and agreement) were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence was 6%, considering either IgG and IgM, and 4.8% considering IgG. Working in COVID-19 Units was not associated with a statistically significant increase in the number of infected workers. Cohen's kappa of agreement between MaglumiTM and VivaDiagTM was quite good when considering IgG only (Cohen's kappa = 78.1%, 95% CI 74.0-82.0%), but was lower considering IgM (Cohen's kappa = 13.3%, 95% CI 7.8-18.7%). CONCLUSION: The large sample size with high participation (84.7%), the biobank and the longitudinal design were significant achievements, offering a baseline dataset as the benchmark for risk assessment, health surveillance and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection for the hospital workforce, especially considering the ongoing vaccination campaign. Study results support the national regulator guidelines on using swabs for SARS-CoV-2 screening with health workers and using the serological tests to contribute to the epidemiological assessment of the spread of the virus.

34338172	Challenges in Hospital-Acquired COVID-19 Surveillance and Attribution of Infection Source. We performed surveillance for hospital-acquired COVID-19 (HA-COVID-19) and compared time-based, electronic definitions to real-time adjudication of the most likely source of acquisition. Without real-time adjudication, nearly 50% of HA-COVID-19 cases identified using electronic definitions were misclassified. Both electronic and traditional contact tracing methods likely underestimated the incidence of HA-COVID-19.	Prevention
34204893	Adherence to COVID-19 Nutrition Guidelines Is Associated with Better Nutritional Management Behaviors of Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients. Good nutritional support is crucial for the immune system to fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, in the context of a pandemic with a highly transmissible coronavirus, implementation of nutrition practice may be difficult. A multicenter electronic survey involving 62 dieticians was conducted, in order to understand barriers associated with dieticians' adherence to nutrition guidelines for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. 69% of dieticians felt under stress when performing nutrition care, and 90% took supplements to boost their own immunity against the coronavirus. The concerns related to clinical practice included a lack of clear guidelines (74%), a lack of access to medical records (55%), inadequate experience or knowledge (48%), and a lack of self-efficacy/confidence (29%) in performing nutritional care. Half (52%) of the dieticians had performed nutrition education/counseling, 47% had monitored a patient's body weight, and 76% had monitored a patient's dietary intake. An adjusted linear regression showed that guideline adherence independently predicted the dieticians' nutrition care behaviors of nutrition counselling (ss: 0.24 (0.002, 0.08); p = 0.04), and monitoring of body weight (ss: 0.43 (0.04, 0.11); p = 0.001) and dietary intake (ss: 0.47(0.03, 0.10); p = 0.001) of COVID-19 patients. Overall, adherence to COVID-19 nutrition guidelines is associated with better nutritional management behaviors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.	Prevention
34226779	Generalized form of fractional order COVID-19 model with Mittag-Leffler kernel. An important advantage of fractional derivatives is that we can formulate models describing much better systems with memory effects. Fractional operators with different memory are related to the different type of relaxation process of the nonlocal dynamical systems. Therefore, we investigate the COVID-19 model with the fractional derivatives in this paper. We apply very effective numerical methods to obtain the numerical results. We also use the Sumudu transform to get the solutions of the models. The Sumudu transform is able to keep the unit of the function, the parity of the function, and has many other properties that are more valuable. We present scientific results in the paper and also prove these results by effective numerical techniques which will be helpful to understand the outbreak of COVID-19.	Epidemic Forecasting
34207567	An Assessment of the Impact of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic on National Antimicrobial Consumption in Jordan. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has overlapping clinical characteristics with bacterial respiratory tract infection, leading to the prescription of potentially unnecessary antibiotics. This study aimed at measuring changes and patterns of national antimicrobial use for one year preceding and one year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Annual national antimicrobial consumption for 2019 and 2020 was obtained from the Jordan Food and Drug Administration (JFDA) following the WHO surveillance methods. The WHO Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) classification was used. Total antibiotic consumption in 2020 (26.8 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day) decreased by 5.5% compared to 2019 (28.4 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day). There was an increase in the use of several antibiotics during 2020 compared with 2019 (third generation cephalosporins (19%), carbapenems (52%), macrolides (57%), and lincosamides (106%)). In 2020, there was a marked reduction in amoxicillin use (-53%), while the use of azithromycin increased by 74%. National antimicrobial consumption of the Access group decreased by 18% from 2019 to 2020 (59.1% vs. 48.1% of total consumption). The use of the Watch group increased in 2020 by 26%. The study highlighted an increase in the use of certain antibiotics during the pandemic period that are known to be associated with increasing resistance. Efforts to enhance national antimicrobial stewardship are needed to ensure rational use of antimicrobials.	Prevention
34287555	Risk factors for death due to COVID-19, in the state of Acre, Brazil, 2020: a retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To analyze risk factors for death in individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study, comprised of adult individuals with COVID-19, from March to September 2020, notified by the Epidemiological Surveillance System in the state of Acre, Brazil. Cox regression was used. RESULTS: Among 57,700 individuals analyzed, the incidence was 2,765.4/100,000 inhabitants, and mortality was, 61.8/100,000 inhabitants. The risk factors for death were: being male (HR=1.48 -95% CI 1.25;1.76), age >/=60 years (HR=10.64 -95% CI 8.84;12.81), symptom of dyspnea (HR=4.20 -95% CI 3.44;5.12) and multimorbidity (HR=2.23 -95% CI 1.77;2.81), with emphasis on heart disease and diabetes mellitus. 'Sore throat' and 'headache' were symptoms present in mild cases of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Being male, elderly, having heart disease, diabetes mellitus and dyspnea were characteristics associated with death due to COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34204988	Return to Basketball Play Following COVID-19 Lockdown. Due to concerns regarding the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), major sporting events and activities have been temporarily suspended or postponed, and a new radical sports protocol has emerged. For most sports there are few recommendations based on scientific evidence for returning to team-game activities following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the extended duration of lockdown, and self-training or detraining in the COVID-19 environment, and this is especially true for basketball. A post-lockdown return to the basketball court ultimately depends on the teams-coaches, trainers, players, and medical staff. Nevertheless, our current scientific knowledge is evidently insufficient as far as safety and return-to-play timing are concerned. This situation presents a major challenge to basketball competition in terms of organization, prioritization, maintaining physical fitness, and decision-making. While preparing an adequate basketball return program, the players' health is the major priority. In this article we briefly discuss the topic and propose multiple strategies.	Prevention

Aim: This study investigates the association between ABO blood phenotype and COVID-19 severity, measured by intensive care unit admission, need for intubation, hospitalization length and death. It further explores clinical predictors of COVID-19 severity within a primarily Hispanic demographic in San Diego County. Materials & methods: We retrospectively reviewed 942 total patients, 473 with available blood type, hospitalized at five Scripps Health hospitals with COVID-19. Results: No significant association was found between ABO phenotype and COVID-19 severity on multivariate analysis, while a diagnosis of anemia and male sex was associated with all severity outcomes on exploratory analysis. Conclusion: Our results provide relevant clinical correlates of COVID-19 severity and help better elucidate the association between ABO phenotype and COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34286217	Higher COVID-19 mortality in low-income communities in the City of Cape Town - a descriptive ecological study. Background Cape Town, a South African city with high levels of economic inequality, has gone through two COVID-19 waves. There is evidence globally that low-income communities experience higher levels of morbidity and mortality during the pandemic. Methods Age-standardized COVID-19 mortality in the eight sub-districts of Cape Town was compared by economic indicators taken from the most recent Census (unemployment rate, monthly income). Results The overall Standardized Death Rate (SDR) for COVID-19 in Cape Town was 1 640 per million, but there was wide variation across the different sub-districts. A linear relationship was seen between sub-districts with high poverty and high COVID-19 SDRs. Conclusions Low-income communities in Cape Town experienced higher levels of COVID-19 mortality. As we continue to contend with COVID-19, these communities need to be prioritized for access to quality health care.	Prevention
34222173	Data Sharing in Southeast Asia During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Background: When a new pathogen emerges, consistent case reporting is critical for public health surveillance. Tracking cases geographically and over time is key for understanding the spread of an infectious disease and effectively designing interventions to contain and mitigate an epidemic. In this paper we describe the reporting systems on COVID-19 in Southeast Asia during the first wave in 2020, and highlight the impact of specific reporting methods. Methods: We reviewed key epidemiological variables from various sources including a regionally comprehensive dataset, national trackers, dashboards, and case bulletins for 11 countries during the first wave of the epidemic in Southeast Asia. We recorded timelines of shifts in epidemiological reporting systems and described the differences in how epidemiological data are reported across countries and timepoints. Results: Our findings suggest that countries in Southeast Asia generally reported precise and detailed epidemiological data during the first wave of the pandemic. Changes in reporting rarely occurred for demographic data, while reporting shifts for geographic and temporal data were frequent. Most countries provided COVID-19 individual-level data daily using HTML and PDF, necessitating scraping and extraction before data could be used in analyses. Conclusion: Our study highlights the importance of more nuanced analyses of COVID-19 epidemiological data within and across countries because of the frequent shifts in reporting. As governments continue to respond to impacts on health and the economy, data sharing also needs to be prioritised given its foundational role in policymaking, and in the implementation and evaluation of interventions.

34340742	Self-reported Changes in Energy Balance Behaviors during COVID-19-related Home Confinement: A Cross-sectional Study. Objectives: Cross-sectional reports on weight gain during the COVID-19 shelter-at-home have raised concerns for weight increases as the pandemic continues. We examined behaviors that impact energy intake and/or energy expenditure among adults in the United States during shelter-at-home. Methods: Cross-sectional data (N=1779; April 24 - May4, 2020) were collected on demographics, diet, physical activity, sleep, and food purchasing behaviors. Percent of participants reporting increase/ decrease/no change in these behaviors during the COVID-19 shelter-at-home were assessed. Each analysis was followed by comparing whether increases or decreases were more likely for each health behavior, in all participants and across sex (43.38% males). Results: Increased consumption of healthy foods, energy-dense unhealthy foods, and snacks, and increased sedentary activities (p < .001) was reported. Physical activity and alcohol intake declined (p < .001). Females were more likely than males (p < .001) to report ultra-processed foods/high-calorie snack intake, fruit/vegetable intake (p < .001) and increase (p < .01) sleep and sedentary behavior. Conclusion: Acute behavioral changes supporting greater energy intake and less energy expenditure, especially in females, underscore the significance of COVID-19-related increase in unstructured time. Longitudinal assessment of body weight and health behaviors is warranted to understand the impact of pandemic.	Prevention

34222681	Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on children with asthma in Jordan: a parental questionnaire. Objective: To evaluate the impact of a 10-week lockdown on children with asthma aged 4-17 years in terms of presentations to the emergency department (ED), frequency of admissions, compliance with medications and changes in pulmonary function testing results. Design and setting: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study using Google Forms to collect parents' and caregivers' responses after they consented to participation. Results: A total of 374 parents/caregivers were contacted and 297 (79%) responded. The majority of the children were male (188 or 63%) and 49.8% were aged 7-12 years. More than half of the participants (194 or 65%) reported improved compliance with medications and spacer use. There was a significant reduction in the number of presentations to the ED from 137 to 80 and admissions to hospital from 56 to 24 during the 10-week lockdown period compared with the same time period in the previous year (p</=0.0001). Around 25% of the participants used telemedicine by phone and social media applications for communication with their treating physician and 59 (80%) described it as easy and smooth. Conclusion: The national lockdown in Jordan due to the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a fall in emergency presentations and hospital admissions for acute asthma exacerbations. Parental responses indicate that fears focused around COVID-19 were associated with enhanced compliance with use preventer medications during the lockdown.	Prevention
34223998	Neurodegenerative proteinopathies associated with neuroinfections. Infectious agents, including viruses and bacteria, are proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to this hypothesis, these agents have capacity to evade the host immune system leading to chronic infection, inflammation, and subsequent deposition of Abeta and phosphorylated-tau in the brain. Co-existing proteinopathies and age-related pathologies are common in AD and the brains of elderly individuals, but whether these are also related to neuroinfections remain to be established. This study determined the prevalence and distribution of neurodegenerative proteinopathies in patients with infection-induced acute or chronic inflammation associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis (n = 13) and neurosyphilis (n = 23). The mean age at death in HSV patients was 53 +/- 12 years (range 24-65 years) and survival was 9 days-6 years following initial infection. The mean age at death and survival in neurosyphilis patients was 60 +/- 15 years (range 36-86 years) and 1-5 years, respectively. Neuronal tau-immunoreactivity and neurites were observed in 8 HSV patients and 19 neurosyphilis patients, and in approximately half of these, this was found in regions associated with inflammation and expanding beyond regions expected from the Braak stage of neurofibrillary degeneration. Five neurosyphilis patients had cortical ageing-related tau astrogliopathy. Abeta-plaques were found in 4 HSV patients and 11 neurosyphilis patients. Lewy bodies were observed in one HSV patient and two neurosyphilis patients. TDP-43 pathology was absent. These observations provide insights into deposition of neurodegenerative proteins in neuroinfections, which might have implications for COVID-19 patients with chronic and/or post-infectious neurological symptoms and encephalitis.

34215246	Self-reported changes in physical activity, sedentary behavior, and screen time among informal caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: Informal caregivers providing unpaid assistance may be vulnerable to changes in health behaviors due to modifications in caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this cross-sectional study explored self-reported changes in physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, and screen time among informal caregivers providing care for older adults aged 50+ during the pandemic. METHODS: Study participants were recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk and reported their perceived changes (increased a lot, increased a little, remained the same, decreased a little, decreased a lot) in moderate-intensity PA (MPA), vigorous-intensity PA (VPA), sedentary behavior, and screen time (weekday and weekend) during the pandemic. For analytic purposes, response categories were categorized into three-level ordinal variables-increased (increased a lot, increased a little), no change (remained the same), decreased (decreased a little, decreased a lot). Multinomial logistic regression models assessed the likelihood of changes (vs. no change) in MPA, VPA, sedentary behavior, and screen time (weekday, weekend) based on caregiving and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: In total, 2574 individuals accessed the study link, 464 of whom did not meet eligibility requirements. In addition, people who completed 80% or less of the survey (n = 1171) and/or duplicate IP addresse (n = 104) were excluded, resulting in an analytic sample of n = 835. The sample was 69% male, had a mean age of 34 (SD = 9.7), and 48% reported increased VPA, while 55% reported increased MPA. The majority also reported increased sedentary behavior, as well as increased screen time. Respondents living with their care recipient were more likely to report increased weekday screen time (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.55, 95% CI 1.11-2.16) and sedentary behavior (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.28-2.53) than respondents not living with the care recipient. Those living with their care recipient were also more likely to reported increased MPA (OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.16-2.32), and VPA (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.09-2.15), but also more likely to report a decrease in VPA (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.14-2.70). CONCLUSION: The majority of respondents reported that their MPA, VPA PA, sedentary behavior, and screen time had changed during the pandemic. Living with the care recipient was associated with both positive and negative changes in behavior. Future research can explore factors associated with these reported changes in behavior.	Prevention
34226648	Leveraging the Massachusetts perinatal quality collaborative to address the COVID-19 pandemic among diverse populations. OBJECTIVE: We leveraged the Massachusetts perinatal quality collaborative (PQC) to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goals were to: (1) implement perinatal practices thought to reduce mother-to-infant SARS-CoV-2 transmission while limiting disruption of health-promoting practices and (2) do so without inequities attributable to race/ethnicity, language status, and social vulnerability. METHODS: Main outcomes were cesarean and preterm delivery, rooming-in, and breastfeeding. We examined changes over time overall and according to race/ethnicity, language status, and social vulnerability from 03/20-07/20 at 11 hospitals. RESULTS: Of 255 mothers with SARS-CoV-2, 67% were black or Hispanic and 47% were non-English speaking. Cesarean decreased (49% to 35%), while rooming-in (55% to 86%) and breastfeeding (53% to 72%) increased. These changes did not differ by race/ethnicity, language, or social vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging the Massachusetts PQC led to rapid changes in perinatal care during the COVID-19 crisis in a short time, representing a novel use of statewide PQC structures.	Prevention
34291285	Biochemical composition, transmission and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2), a novel human coronavirus. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization in March 2020 for its continuous and rapid spread worldwide. Rapidly emerging COVID-19 epicenters and mutants of concerns have created mammoth chaos in healthcare sectors across the globe. With over 185 million infections and approximately 4 million deaths globally, COVID-19 continues its unchecked spread despite all mitigation measures. Until effective and affordable antiretroviral drugs are made available and the population at large is vaccinated, timely diagnosis of the infection and adoption of COVID-appropriate behavior remains major tool available to curtail the still escalating COVID-19 pandemic. This review provides an updated overview of various techniques of COVID-19 testing in human samples and also discusses, in brief, the biochemical composition and mode of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Technological advancement in various molecular, serological and immunological techniques including mainly the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), CRISPR, lateral flow assays (LFAs), and immunosensors are reviewed.

34222503	Challenges for dental professionals during COVID-19 pandemic: Are we prepared? BACKGROUND: With the emerging knowledge and understanding of novel coronavirus infection, dentists must be capable of resuming their practice with necessary precautions in near future; hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practices along with felt challenges by the dentists concerning practicing dentistry during pandemic in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted on the dental practitioners of Uttarakhand, India. The dentists were approached by obtaining their E-mail address from the heads of dental institutions or dental association branches in the state. The knowledge, attitude, and practices along with apparent challenges of practicing during pandemic were assessed using closed-ended questionnaire. The relationship between the mean scores and demographic variables was determined using Student's unpaired t-test by keeping the significance level below 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 759 respondents, a total of 458 respondents were male (60%), whereas 301 (40%) were female. The mean knowledge scores were higher in females (11.06 +/- 2.12) compared to males (9.72 +/- 4.53), which was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The mean practice score was lower in males (17.49 +/- 6.47) compared to females (19.26 +/- 6.69) and likewise lower scores were seen in graduates compared to specialists and these differences were again statistically significant (P < 0.05). Majority of the study participants felt that following various safety guidelines were not feasible (96.97%) and too expensive (96.44%) and considered them as a challenge. CONCLUSION: It is imperative that dentists should be fully prepared before resuming their services and reach the right kind of awareness to limit the spread of the disease.	Prevention
34342110	Morphological alterations in tongue epithelial cells infected by SARS-CoV-2: A case-control study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present case-control study was to evaluate the morphological aspects of the epithelial cells from the dorsum of the tongue and the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in these cells, in patients with and without COVID-19 infection. METHODS: 24 individuals with at least one symptom of COVID-19 were recruited among inpatients from Hospital Universitario Pedro Ernesto (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). 14 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR were included in the case group, and 10 patients who tested negative were included in the control group. Cytological smears from the dorsum of the tongue were obtained from all patients and analyzed using immunohistochemistry directed against SARS-CoV-2-Spike protein. Morphological changes in epithelial cells were analyzed using light microscopy. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed that 71% of the COVID-19 patients presented epithelial cells positive for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, and all cells coming from patients in the control group were negative. Cytological analysis showed significant differences when comparing epithelial cells from COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 may generate dimensional changes in tongue epithelial cells; however, further studies are necessary to understand how this happens.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
34130913	COVID-19 and plastic surgery: lessons from a national speciality review in the United Kingdom. BACKGROUND: Ramifications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the re-structuring of healthcare are widespread, including delivery of surgical services across all specialties, including plastic surgery. Re-deployment of personnel and cessation of elective services are commonplace. However, there is a continued need for both emergency and oncological surgery. A national review of practice was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, to assess impact on services, staffing and training. METHODS: Key aspects of current plastic surgery practice in the United Kingdom were examined in this cross-sectional study; operating capacity, location of theatre lists (national health service or outsourced private institutions (PIs)), differences across sub-specialties, change in anaesthesia practices, staffing, re-deployment, on-call provision and impact on training. RESULTS: Three-hundred and forty-four plastic surgeons in the United Kingdom provided practice data across 51 units. Theatre capacity and outpatient services were markedly reduced. Outsourcing of operating lists to PIs was widely utilised. Increased use of local anaesthetic hand procedures, the prioritisation of shorter operations with reduced microsurgery in both head and neck/lower limb and almost complete cessation of breast reconstruction were noted, together with marked regional variations. Re-deployment occurred at all staffing levels, whilst telemedicine played a critical role in both patient management and training. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has enforced unprecedented changes to surgical care delivery and training, as identified by examination of plastic surgery nationally in the United Kingdom. Novel means to support continued elective and emergency services, including oncology have been identified. Lessons learned will allow phased return of services and improved preparation for the future.	Prevention
34223480	"Clinician Perspectives on Implementing Video Visits in Home-Based Palliative Care. Background: Despite the increasing use and acceptance of technology in health care, there is limited evidence on the usefulness and appropriate use of telehealth in home-based palliative care (HBPC). As part of the process evaluation of a pragmatic trial of video visits in HBPC, we assessed clinician experience with video visit implementation. Methods: We assessed clinicians' experiences with and perception of the usefulness and appropriateness of video visits using anonymous surveys and brief qualitative interviews with a subset of survey participants. Qualitative analyses were guided by sociotechnical frameworks that emphasize technology's ""value proposition"" for its end users as being key to adoption. Results: Clinicians (36 physicians and 48 registered nurses) generally had favorable attitudes toward video visits and telehealth. Respondents felt confident in the skills needed to make their role in video visits successful. Clinicians were neutral on whether video visits were useful for their practice or enhanced the patient-caregiver experience. Clinicians found video visits to be most appropriate for follow-up care (as opposed to start of care). The interviews yielded two themes that complemented the survey findings: (1) factors enhancing the value proposition (positive responses from patients and families and convenience) and (2) factors diminishing the value proposition (issues related to the technology and scheduling). Discussion: Our findings provide insights into clinicians' experiences with implementing remote video physician consultations, facilitated by a nurse in the patient's home in the pre-COVID-19 era. Clinician views about video visits may have shifted with the pandemic, which occurred after our data collection was complete. Clinical Trials Registration No. NCT#03694431."	Prevention
34217435	Telehealth in Multidisciplinary Target Delineation for Radiotherapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic. A Review and a Case. Like all other medical specialties, radiotherapy has been deeply influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had severe influence on the entire patient trajectory in oncology, from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up. Many examples of how to deal with patient and staff safety, shortness of staff and other resources and the quest to continue high-quality, evidence-based treatment have been presented. The use of telemedicine and telehealth is frequently presented as a part of the solution to overcome these challenges. Some of the available presented solutions will only apply in an acute, local setting, whereas others might inspire the community to improve quality and cost-effectiveness of radiotherapy as well as knowledge sharing in the future. Some of the unresolved issues in many of the available technical solutions are related to data security and public regulation, for example, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in the EU and HIPAA compliance (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the USA. Using a solution that involves a supplier's server in a non-EU country is problematic within the EU. In this paper we shortly review the influence of COVID-19 on radiotherapy. We describe some of the possible solutions for telehealth in target delineation - a crucial part of high-quality radiotherapy, which often requires multidisciplinary effort, hands-on corporation, and high-quality multimodal imaging. Hereafter, our own technical solution will be presented as a case.	Prevention
34132971	Evaluation of central venous catheter and other risk factors for mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 in Brazil. PURPOSE: Hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of death. We aimed to describe the characteristics of a cohort of Brazilian hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 and assess their mortality rate and risk factors for death. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 741 Brazilian hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Feb-Dec/2020, of 52 dialysis centers of the country. We analyzed comorbid conditions, sociodemographic factors, and dialysis-related parameters. To detect risk factors for mortality in hemodialysis patients, we performed multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier. RESULTS: From 9877 hemodialysis patients, 741 were diagnosed with COVID-19. Mean age was 57 +/- 16 years, 61% were male, and 51% white. The most frequent symptoms were fever (54.1%), cough (50.9%), and dyspnea (37.2%); 14.2% were asymptomatic. There were 139 deaths (18.8%), with 66% within the disease's first 15 days. 333 patients (44.9%) required hospitalization, and 211 (28.5%) were admitted to an intensive care unit. The cumulative probability of survival at 90 days of diagnosis was 79% (95% CI 76-82%). In the fully adjusted multivariate model, the risk factors significantly associated with death were diabetes mellitus (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05-2.19, P = 0.026), use of a central venous catheter (CVC) (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.22-2.64, P = 0.003), age (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04, P < 0.001), and origin from the North vs. Southeast region (HR 2.60, 95% CI 1.01-6.68, P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis patients using a CVC as the vascular access, aside from diabetic and elderly ones, should be closely monitored due to their high risk of death in the course of the COVID-19.

34199053	Systemic Adverse Events and Use of Antipyretics Predict the Neutralizing Antibody Positivity Early after the First Dose of ChAdOx1 Coronavirus Disease Vaccine. Vaccination is considered crucial for the eradication of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In our medical center in Korea, most health care workers (HCWs) were vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccine. After vaccination, many HCWs complained of adverse events (AEs). However, it remains unclear whether the production of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) was affected. Therefore, here, we aimed to evaluate AEs and early NAb production in relatively healthy Asians who received the ChAdOx1 vaccine and determine the effect of AEs and antipyretics on early NAb production against COVID-19. Of the 182 Korean HCWs who received the first dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine, 172 (94.5%) experienced >/=1 adverse events and 148 (81.3%) tested positive for NAb 33-40 days after the vaccination. NAb-positive vaccine recipients reported systemic AEs and consumed acetaminophen more frequently than NAb-negative recipients. We identified an association between antibody response and COVID-19 vaccine-related AEs. In conclusion, most ChAdOx1 vaccine recipients reported AEs in our medical center.	Treatment
34226865	Viral transport media for COVID-19 testing. Precautionary measures of physical isolation, social distancing, and masks have all aided in controlling the spread of COVID-19. However, detection of the virus is crucial to implement isolation of infected individuals. This paper presents the innovative repurposing of lab materials, workspace, and personnel in response to the COVID-19-induced shutdown and consequential shortage of commercially made virus transport media (VTM). This method for VTM production highlights the ability of standard research labs to fulfill the needs of those affected by the pandemic and potential recurrence of outbreaks. Further, the collaboration of the various entities at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC) allowed for efficient production and distribution of VTM tubes to facilitate mass COVID-19 testing. We propose that implementation of this process by university research labs would enable quicker interventions, potentially better outcomes, and prevention of further spread of disease.

34292870	Inhalable nanocatchers for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), presents an urgent health crisis. More recently, an increasing number of mutated strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified globally. Such mutations, especially those on the spike glycoprotein to render its higher binding affinity to human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (hACE2) receptors, not only resulted in higher transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but also raised serious concerns regarding the efficacies of vaccines against mutated viruses. Since ACE2 is the virus-binding protein on human cells regardless of viral mutations, we design hACE2-containing nanocatchers (NCs) as the competitor with host cells for virus binding to protect cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The hACE2-containing NCs, derived from the cellular membrane of genetically engineered cells stably expressing hACE2, exhibited excellent neutralization ability against pseudoviruses of both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the D614G variant. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in the lung, the most vulnerable organ for COVID-19, we develop an inhalable formulation by mixing hACE2-containing NCs with mucoadhesive excipient hyaluronic acid, the latter of which could significantly prolong the retention of NCs in the lung after inhalation. Excitingly, inhalation of our formulation could lead to potent pseudovirus inhibition ability in hACE2-expressing mouse model, without imposing any appreciable side effects. Importantly, our inhalable hACE2-containing NCs in the lyophilized formulation would allow long-term storage, facilitating their future clinical use. Thus, this work may provide an alternative tactic to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infections even with different mutations, exhibiting great potential for treatment of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic.

34203115	Persistent Symptoms in Post-COVID-19 Patients Attending Follow-Up OPD at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH), Kathmandu, Nepal. The long-term effects of COVID-19 among survivors is a matter of concern. This research aimed to study persistent symptoms in post-COVID-19 patients attending a follow-up clinic at a tertiary care hospital in Nepal. All patients, presenting to the outpatient clinic during the study duration of six weeks, with history of positive reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) at least two weeks prior to presentation, were included. The duration of follow-up ranged from 15 till 150 days with the mean duration of 28 days after diagnosis of COVID-19. Of 118 patients, 43 (36.4%) had a history of mild COVID-19, 15 (12.8%) had moderate, and 60 (50.8%) had severe. At the time of presentation, 97 (82.2%) patients reported that they had at least one persistent/new symptom beyond two weeks from the diagnosis of COVID-19. Dyspnea, fatigue, chest heaviness, and cough were the commonest persistent complaints in 48 (40.7%), 39 (33.1%), 33 (28%), and 32 (27.1%) patients, respectively. The findings in our study highlight the need for extended monitoring of post-COVID-19 patients following discharge, in order to understand and mitigate long-term implications of the disease.

34213751	Learning from Crisis: a Multicentre Study of Oncology Telemedicine Clinics Introduced During COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated adaptation of cancer patient care. Oncology patients who contract COVID-19 have poor outcomes. Telemedicine clinics (teleclinics) have been introduced for cancer patients to reduce the risk of horizontal transmission at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and The Royal Free Hospital in London. Teleclinics have become routine in many specialities; however, inclusion in oncology care was not standard prior to the pandemic. A mixed-methods survey was designed and delivered to cancer patients (n = 106) at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and The Royal Free Hospital who had transitioned to teleclinics in March 2020. The survey explored patients' perceptions of this format. In total, 96 (90.5%) patients consented to take part, across a range of tumour types. Overall, respondents reacted favourably to the format of the teleclinics, with 90.6% of respondents (87/96) stating they would utilise teleclinics beyond the pandemic. Additionally, a survey was distributed to clinicians delivering these teleclinics (n = 16) to explore previous training in, perceptions of, and lessons learned from the introduction of telemedicine. Results suggest patients are accepting of teleclinic use for most clinical purposes. Teleclinic implementation affords benefits to cancer patient care both during and after COVID-19, but there is an urgent need for telemedicine education in oncology specialty training.	Prevention
34200959	Discovery of Antivirals Using Phage Display. The latest coronavirus disease outbreak, COVID-19, has brought attention to viral infections which have posed serious health threats to humankind throughout history. The rapid global spread of COVID-19 is attributed to the increased human mobility of today's world, yet the threat of viral infections to global public health is expected to increase continuously in part due to increasing human-animal interface. Development of antiviral agents is crucial to combat both existing and novel viral infections. Recently, there is a growing interest in peptide/protein-based drug molecules. Antibodies are becoming especially predominant in the drug market. Indeed, in a remarkably short period, four antibody therapeutics were authorized for emergency use in COVID-19 treatment in the US, Russia, and India as of November 2020. Phage display has been one of the most widely used screening methods for peptide/antibody drug discovery. Several phage display-derived biologics are already in the market, and the expiration of intellectual property rights of phage-display antibody discovery platforms suggests an increment in antibody drugs in the near future. This review summarizes the most common phage display libraries used in antiviral discovery, highlights the approaches employed to enhance the antiviral potency of selected peptides/antibody fragments, and finally provides a discussion about the present status of the developed antivirals in clinic.

34361915	Possible Targets of Pan-Coronavirus Antiviral Strategies for Emerging or Re-Emerging Coronaviruses. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused Coronaviruses Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a worldwide pandemic, is the seventh human coronavirus that has been cross-transmitted from animals to humans. It can be predicted that with continuous contact between humans and animals, more viruses will spread from animals to humans. Therefore, it is imperative to develop universal coronavirus or pan-coronavirus vaccines or drugs against the next coronavirus pandemic. However, a suitable target is critical for developing pan-coronavirus antivirals against emerging or re-emerging coronaviruses. In this review, we discuss the latest progress of possible targets of pan-coronavirus antiviral strategies for emerging or re-emerging coronaviruses, including targets for pan-coronavirus inhibitors and vaccines, which will provide prospects for the current and future research and treatment of the disease.

34217276	Increasing adiposity and the presence of cardiometabolic morbidity is associated with increased Covid-19-related mortality: results from the UK Biobank. BACKGROUND: Although obesity, defined by body mass index (BMI), has been associated with a higher risk of hospitalisation and more severe course of illness in Covid-19 positive patients amongst the British population, it is unclear if this translates into increased mortality. Furthermore, given that BMI is an insensitive indicator of adiposity, the effect of adipose volume on Covid-19 outcomes is also unknown. METHODS: We used the UK Biobank repository, which contains clinical and anthropometric data and is linked to Public Health England Covid-19 healthcare records, to address our research question. We performed age- and sex- adjusted logistic regression and Chi-squared test to compute the odds for Covid-19-related mortality as a consequence of increasing BMI, and other more sensitive indices of adiposity such as waist:hip ratio (WHR) and percent body fat, as well as concomitant cardiometabolic illness. RESULTS: 13,502 participants were tested for Covid-19 (mean age 70 +/- 8 years, 48.9% male). 1582 tested positive (mean age 68 +/- 9 years, 52.8% male), of which 305 died (mean age 75 +/- 6 years, 65.5% male). Increasing adiposity was associated with higher odds for Covid-19-related mortality. For every unit increase in BMI, WHR and body fat, the odds of death amongst Covid19-positive participants increased by 1.04 (95% CI 1.01-1.07), 10.71 (95% CI 1.57-73.06) and 1.03 (95% CI 1.01-1.05), respectively (all p < 0.05). Referenced to Covid-19 positive participants with a normal weight (BMI 18.5-25 kg/m(2)), Covid-19 positive participants with BMI > 35 kg/m(2) had significantly higher odds of Covid-19-related death (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.06-2.74, p < 0.05). Covid-19-positive participants with metabolic (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia) or cardiovascular morbidity (atrial fibrillation, angina) also had higher odds of death. CONCLUSIONS: Anthropometric indices that are more sensitive to adipose volume and its distribution than BMI, as well as concurrent cardiometabolic illness, are associated with higher odds of Covid-19-related mortality amongst the UK Biobank cohort that tested positive for the infection. These results suggest adipose volume may contribute to adverse Covid-19-related outcomes associated with obesity.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34352002	Natural killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors trigger differences in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. BACKGROUND: The diversity in the clinical course of COVID-19 has been related to differences in innate and adaptative immune response mechanisms. Natural killer (NK) lymphocytes are critical protagonists of human host defense against viral infections. It would seem that reduced circulating levels of these cells have an impact on COVID-19 progression and severity. Their activity is strongly regulated by killer-cell immuno-globulin-like receptors (KIRs) expressed on the NK cell surface. The present study's focus was to investigate the impact of KIRs and their HLA Class I ligands on SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: KIR gene frequencies, KIR haplotypes, KIR ligands and combinations of KIRs and their HLA Class I ligands were investigated in 396 Sardinian patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Comparisons were made between 2 groups of patients divided according to disease severity: 240 patients were symptomatic or paucisymptomatic (Group A), 156 hospitalized patients had severe disease (Group S). The immunogenetic characteristics of patients were also compared to a population group of 400 individuals from the same geographical areas. RESULTS: Substantial differences were obtained for KIR genes, KIR haplotypes and KIR-HLA ligand combinations when comparing patients of Group S to those of Group A. Patients in Group S had a statistically significant higher frequency of the KIR A/A haplotype compared to patients in Group A [34.6% vs 23.8%, OR = 1.7 (95% CI 1.1-2.6); P = 0.02, Pc = 0.04]. Moreover, the KIR2DS2/HLA C1 combination was poorly represented in the group of patients with severe symptoms compared to those of the asymptomatic-paucisymptomatic group [33.3% vs 50.0%, OR = 0.5 (95% CI 0.3-0.8), P = 0.001, Pc = 0.002]. Multivariate analysis confirmed that, regardless of the sex and age of the patients, the latter genetic variable correlated with a less severe disease course [ORM = 0.4 (95% CI 0.3-0.7), PM = 0.0005, PMC = 0.005]. CONCLUSIONS: The KIR2DS2/HLA C1 functional unit resulted to have a strong protective effect against the adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Combined to other well known factors such as advanced age, male sex and concomitant autoimmune diseases, this marker could prove to be highly informative of the disease course and thus enable the timely intervention needed to reduce the mortality associated with the severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, larger studies in other populations as well as experimental functional studies will be needed to confirm our findings and further pursue the effect of KIR receptors on NK cell immune-mediated response to SARS-Cov-2 infection.

The composition and properties of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and apoA-II in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) might be critical to SARS-CoV-2 infection via SR-BI and antiviral activity against COVID-19. HDL containing native apoA-I showed potent antiviral activity, while HDL containing glycated apoA-I or other apolipoproteins did not. However, there has been no report to elucidate the putative role of apoA-II in the antiviral activity of HDL.	Mechanism;Treatment
34205852	Infection-Mediated Clinical Biomarkers for a COVID-19 Electrical Biosensing Platform. The race towards the development of user-friendly, portable, fast-detection, and low-cost devices for healthcare systems has become the focus of effective screening efforts since the pandemic attack in December 2019, which is known as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Currently existing techniques such as RT-PCR, antigen-antibody-based detection, and CT scans are prompt solutions for diagnosing infected patients. However, the limitations of currently available indicators have enticed researchers to search for adjunct or additional solutions for COVID-19 diagnosis. Meanwhile, identifying biomarkers or indicators is necessary for understanding the severity of the disease and aids in developing efficient drugs and vaccines. Therefore, clinical studies on infected patients revealed that infection-mediated clinical biomarkers, especially pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins, are highly associated with COVID-19. These biomarkers are undermined or overlooked in the context of diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of infected patients. Hence, this review discusses the potential implementation of these biomarkers for COVID-19 electrical biosensing platforms. The secretion range for each biomarker is reviewed based on clinical studies. Currently available electrical biosensors comprising electrochemical and electronic biosensors associated with these biomarkers are discussed, and insights into the use of infection-mediated clinical biomarkers as prognostic and adjunct diagnostic indicators in developing an electrical-based COVID-19 biosensor are provided.

The present study aimed to assess antibody seropositivity prevalence among symptomatic individuals and individuals with a high risk of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Participants from Chelyabinsk (Russian Federation) who were at an increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (high-risk group, n = 1091) and participants who either had symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or were suspected to have experienced COVID-19 in the past (symptomatic group, n = 692) were enrolled between 28 September and 30 December 2020. Blood samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay D-5501 SARS-Cov-2-IgG-EIA-BEST and D-5502 SARS-Cov-2-IgM-EIA-BEST (AO Vector-Best, Novosibirsk, Russia). The overall seropositivity rate was 28.33-28.53%. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 17.23% (adjusted prevalence of 17.17-17.29%) of participants in the high-risk and 45.95% (adjusted prevalence of 45.91-46.24%) in the symptomatic group. Higher IgG and IgM titers were observed in women compared to men, as well as in participants in the symptomatic group compared to those in the high-risk group. The results indicate that the seroprevalence among residents in several Russian regions is low (28.38%) and inadequate to provide herd immunity. The lower seroprevalence among participants in the high-risk group may be attributed to the enforcement of healthcare protocols and the use of adequate personal protective equipment.

34209123	Investigation of Four Clusters of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Rwanda, 2020. We reported the findings of the first Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) four clusters identified in Rwanda. Case-investigations included contact elicitation, testing, and isolation/quarantine of confirmed cases. Socio-demographic and clinical data on cases and contacts were collected. A confirmed case was a person with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR) while a contact was any person who had contact with a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed case within 72 h prior, to 14 days after symptom onset; or 14 days before collection of the laboratory-positive sample for asymptomatic cases. High risk contacts were those who had come into unprotected face-to-face contact or had been in a closed environment with a SARS-CoV-2 case for >15 min. Forty cases were reported from four clusters by 22 April 2020, accounting for 61% of locally transmitted cases within six weeks. Clusters A, B, C and D were associated with two nightclubs, one house party, and different families or households living in the same compound (multi-family dwelling). Thirty-six of the 1035 contacts tested were positive (secondary attack rate: 3.5%). Positivity rates were highest among the high-risk contacts compared to low-risk contacts (10% vs. 2.2%). Index cases in three of the clusters were imported through international travelling. Fifteen of the 40 cases (38%) were asymptomatic while 13/25 (52%) and 8/25 (32%) of symptomatic cases had a cough and fever respectively. Gatherings in closed spaces were the main early drivers of transmission. Systematic case-investigations contact tracing and testing likely contributed to the early containment of SARS-CoV-2 in Rwanda.	Prevention;Transmission;Diagnosis
34198601	Concerns, Knowledge, and Practices of Dentists in Mexico Regarding Infection Control during the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study. Dentists are highly exposed and vulnerable during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as physical proximity to patients is necessary for effective dental examination and treatment. The objective of this study was to describe the concerns, knowledge, and infection control practices of dentists in Mexico during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study conducted from 22 May 2020 to 8 July 2020, an anonymous survey was distributed to dentists, which covered information regarding dentists' sociodemographic and professional characteristics, clinical practices during the pandemic, and perceptions regarding the application of infection prevention and control guidance for dental settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of 703 respondents, 73.1% (n = 514) were women and 53.6% (n = 377) were dentists with 1-10 years of experience. Regarding the statements issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the responses for 11 survey items had total agreement rates >90% (high frequency); seven and nine items had moderate and low frequency of total agreement, respectively. Most dentists in this study agreed with the WHO and CDC statements and were concerned regarding the possibility of infection, despite using the protective gear.	Prevention
34281181	Antimicrobial Activity of Curcumin in Nanoformulations: A Comprehensive Review. Curcumin (CUR) is a natural substance extracted from turmeric that has antimicrobial properties. Due to its ability to absorb light in the blue spectrum, CUR is also used as a photosensitizer (PS) in antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy (aPDT). However, CUR is hydrophobic, unstable in solutions, and has low bioavailability, which hinders its clinical use. To circumvent these drawbacks, drug delivery systems (DDSs) have been used. In this review, we summarize the DDSs used to carry CUR and their antimicrobial effect against viruses, bacteria, and fungi, including drug-resistant strains and emergent pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. The reviewed DDSs include colloidal (micelles, liposomes, nanoemulsions, cyclodextrins, chitosan, and other polymeric nanoparticles), metallic, and mesoporous particles, as well as graphene, quantum dots, and hybrid nanosystems such as films and hydrogels. Free (non-encapsulated) CUR and CUR loaded in DDSs have a broad-spectrum antimicrobial action when used alone or as a PS in aPDT. They also show low cytotoxicity, in vivo biocompatibility, and improved wound healing. Although there are several in vitro and some in vivo investigations describing the nanotechnological aspects and the potential antimicrobial application of CUR-loaded DDSs, clinical trials are not reported and further studies should translate this evidence to the clinical scenarios of infections.

34285718	Persistent decline of hospitalizations for acute stroke and acute coronary syndrome during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece: collateral damage unaffected. Background: An alarming cerebro/cardiovascular collateral damage, reflected by a decline in admissions for acute stroke (AS) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), was observed during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby leading to a re-design of public campaigns. However, there are limited data regarding the AS and ACS hospitalization rates during the second wave of the pandemic, which was followed by re-imposition of lockdowns. Methods: We calculated the rate of AS and ACS hospitalizations from three representative tertiary care hospitals in Greece during a 2-month period (November-December 2020) of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the corresponding control period in 2019 from three representative tertiary care hospitals in Greece. This was a follow-up study with identical design to our previous report evaluating AS and ACS hospitalizations during the first wave of the pandemic (March-April 2020). Results: Compared with 2019, there was a 34% relative reduction of AS hospitalizations [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48-0.92, p = 0.013] and 33% relative reduction of ACS hospitalizations (IRR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54-0.83, p < 0.001) during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The relative reduction was smaller and did not reach the level of statistical significance for the respective syndromes (haemorrhagic stroke: IRR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.41-1.82, p = 0.71; ST-elevation myocardial infarction: IRR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.57-1.14, p = 0.22). Conclusion: AS and ACS hospitalizations were persistently reduced during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 2019 in Greece. This decline was similar to the observations during the first wave despite the large differences in the epidemiological COVID-19 burden. Lockdowns, a common characteristic in both waves, appear to have a detrimental indirect impact on cerebro/cardiovascular diseases in the general population.	Prevention
34343819	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing for essential food production workers: evolving thinking, pilot testing, and lessons learned. An essential part of U.S. coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) critical infrastructure is the country's food-production workforce. Keeping food-production workers safe during the COVID-19 pandemic has meant added workplace protections. Protection guidance came early from the Federal Government. Absent from such guidance were strategies to screen for the causative virus. Without viral screening, some food companies had outbreaks; some facilities had to close. Companies interested in viral screening had to devise their own strategies. One company devised a strategy having three main goals: (1) detecting asymptomatic infections, before opportunity for spread; (2) identifying workplace clusters, to indicate potential protection breakdowns; and (3) comparing company results to community infection rates. The company decided on pilot screenings at two U.S. production plants. Screenings involved mandatory viral testing (through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and optional antibody testing (both immunoglobulins G and M). Pilot screenings showed benefits along with limitations: (1) detecting asymptomatic infections, but at questionably relevant time points; (2) identifying infection clusters, but with uncertain sites of transmission; (3) showing relatively low rates of infection, but absent details for meaningful community comparisons. Establishing a worker screening process was an enormous undertaking. Company employees had to stretch job roles and were distracted form usual responsibilities. Whether other companies would find sufficient benefits to justify similar screening is unclear. Moving forward, new Federal leadership could provide greater support for, and assistance with, worker screenings. In addition, new technologies could make future screenings more feasible and valuable. The worker screening experience from this pandemic offers learnings the next.	Prevention
34204252	First Dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Reduces Symptom Duration and Viral Clearance in Healthcare Workers. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than one hundred million people since the beginning of the worldwide pandemic. In this study, data from a large hospital in central Italy was used to evaluate the impact of the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on SARS-CoV-2 infections in terms of the prevalence of symptomatic cases, symptom duration, and viral clearance timing. All vaccinated Healthcare Workers (HCWs) with positive RT-PCR by nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were divided into two cohorts (positive RT-PCR within day 12 and positive RT-PCR between day 13 and day 21 after first dose administration) and compared for the presence and duration of symptoms and the timing of viral clearance. The same variables were evaluated across HCWs with positive RT-PCR within 6 days after first dose administration and non-vaccinated HCWs with positive RT-PCR between 1 October 2020 and 28 February 2021. Eighteen HCWs tested positive on RT-PCR by NP swab from day 1 to day 12 after the 1st dose administration (incidence rate 6.2 x 10(-4)) and 5 HCWs from day 13 to day 21 (incidence rate 2.3 x 10(-4)). Symptom duration and viral clearance timing are significantly shorter in the cohort of HCWs with positive RT-PCR 12 days after the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. The administration of the first dose proved effective in reducing presence, symptom duration, and viral clearance even in HCWs vaccinated for less than 6 days. These results could have implications on public health and post-exposure prophylaxis.	Treatment;Diagnosis
34200425	Mesenchymal Stem Cells as a Gene Delivery Tool: Promise, Problems, and Prospects. The cell-based approach in gene therapy arises as a promising strategy to provide safe, targeted, and efficient gene delivery. Owing to their unique features, as homing and tumor-tropism, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently been introduced as an encouraging vehicle in gene therapy. Nevertheless, non-viral transfer of nucleic acids into MSCs remains limited due to various factors related to the main stakeholders of the process (e.g., nucleic acids, carriers, or cells). In this review, we have summarized the main types of nucleic acids used to transfect MSCs, the pros and cons, and applications of each. Then, we have emphasized on the most efficient lipid-based carriers for nucleic acids to MSCs, their main features, and some of their applications. While a myriad of studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential for engineered MSCs therapy in various illnesses, optimization for clinical use is an ongoing challenge. On the way of improvement, genetically modified MSCs have been combined with various novel techniques and tools (e.g., exosomes, spheroids, 3D-Bioprinting, etc.,) aiming for more efficient and safe applications in biomedicine.

The onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the necessary public health measures implemented to slow the transmission have increased barriers to care for these same women. This commentary explores the implications of these measures and discusses strategies we have developed to manage these challenges based on our work in a clinical trial providing patient navigation to pregnant mothers with OUD. We believe these solutions can be applied in medical, behavioral health, and research settings through the pandemic and beyond to increase the quality of care and resources to this vulnerable population.

34367680	Clinical trial enrollment at a rural satellite hospital during COVID-19 pandemic. Introduction: Controlled clinical trials (CCTs) have traditionally been limited to urban academic clinical centers. Implementation of CCTs in rural setting is challenged by lack of resources, the inexperience of patient care team members in CCT conductance and workflow interruption, and global inexperience with remote data monitoring. Methods: We report our experience during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in activating through remote monitoring a multicenter clinical trial (the Study of Efficacy and Safety of Canakinumab Treatment for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in Participants with COVID-19-induced Pneumonia [CAN-COVID] trial, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04362813) at a rural satellite hospital, the VCU Health Community Memorial Hospital (VCU-CMH) in South Hill, VA, that is part of the larger VCU Health network, with the lead institution being VCU Health Medical College of Virginia Hospital (VCU-MCV), Richmond, VA. We used the local resources at the facility and remote guidance and oversight from the VCU-MCV resources using a closed-loop communication network. Investigational pharmacy, pathology, and nursing were essential to operate the work in coordination with the lead institution. Results: Fifty-one patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from May to August 2020, 35 (69%) at VCU-MCV, and 16 (31%) at VCU-CMH. Among the patients enrolled at VCU-CMH, 37.5% were female, 62.5% Black, and had a median age of 60 (interquartile range 56-68) years. Conclusion: Local decentralization of this trial in our experience gave rural patients access to a novel treatment and also accelerated enrollment and more diverse participants' representative of the target population.

34282196	Metagenomic identification of a new sarbecovirus from horseshoe bats in Europe. The source of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown, but the natural host of the progenitor sarbecovirus is thought to be Asian horseshoe (rhinolophid) bats. We identified and sequenced a novel sarbecovirus (RhGB01) from a British horseshoe bat, at the western extreme of the rhinolophid range. Our results extend both the geographic and species ranges of sarbecoviruses and suggest their presence throughout the horseshoe bat distribution. Within the spike protein receptor binding domain, but excluding the receptor binding motif, RhGB01 has a 77% (SARS-CoV-2) and 81% (SARS-CoV) amino acid homology. While apparently lacking hACE2 binding ability, and hence unlikely to be zoonotic without mutation, RhGB01 presents opportunity for SARS-CoV-2 and other sarbecovirus homologous recombination. Our findings highlight that the natural distribution of sarbecoviruses and opportunities for recombination through intermediate host co-infection are underestimated. Preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to bats is critical with the current global mass vaccination campaign against this virus.	Mechanism;Transmission

Model systems that poorly represent a virus' cellular environment, however, may impede research and waste resources. Collaborations between cell biologists and virologists have led to the rapid development of representative organoid model systems to study severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We believe that lung organoids, in particular, have advanced our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and have laid a foundation to study future pandemic viruses and develop effective treatments.

34353250	Current perspective of COVID-19 on neurology: A mechanistic insight. SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus and the causative organism of Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc worldwide producing asymptomatic to symptomatic cases leading to significant morbidity and mortality even after infection. Most of the countries reported a mortality rate of 2-3 % majorly due to cardiorespiratory failures. Recent studies highlighted the neurological involvement playing a key role in cardiorespiratory failures and other symptoms such as headache, anosmia, and ageusia observed in Covid-19 patients. Studies suggests SARS-CoV-2 entry via olfactory epithelium (OE) and the expression of type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) in addition to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. The virus can either travel via peripheral blood vessel causing endothelial dysfunction, triggering coagulation cascade and multiple organ dysfunction or reach the systemic circulation and take a different route to the blood brain barrier (BBB), disrupting the BBB causing neuroinflammation or neuronal excitotoxicity resulting in the development of encephalitis, encephalopathy, seizures, and strokes. SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem is believed to be responsible for the cardiorespiratory failures observed in Covid-19 patients. Apart from viral invasion via hematogenous route, SARS-CoV-2 neural invasion via PNS nerve terminal, resulting in viral replication and retrograde transportation to soma leading to invasion of the CNS including the brain producing neurological manifestations of the disease either in the initial stages or during the course of the disease and even in a long period post infection in many cases. The ACE2 receptors are expressed in the brain and glial cells and SARS-CoV-2 acts via neuronal as well as non-neuronal pathway. But the exact cell types involved and how they can trigger inflammatory pathways need further in-depth study for the development of targeted therapy.	Mechanism;Treatment
34353251	The Promising Enzymes for Inhibitors Development against COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, it has been an epidemic for nearly a year. COVID-19 has brought painful disasters to people all over the world. It not only threatens lives and health, but also induces economic crises. At present, promising methods to eradicate COVID-19 mainly include drugs and vaccines. Enzyme inhibitors have always been a reliable strategy for the treatment of related diseases. Scientists worldwide have worked together to study COVID-19, have obtained the structure of key SARS-CoV-2 associated enzymes, and reported the research of inhibitors of these enzymes. This article summarizes COVID-19-related enzyme inhibitors' recent development, mainly including 3CLpro, PLpro, TMPRSS2, and RdRp inhibitors, hoping to provide valuable weapons in the ensuing battle against COVID-19.

34198852	Comparative Study of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and Influenza Host Gene Expression in Asthma: Importance of Sex, Disease Severity, and Epithelial Heterogeneity. Epithelial characteristics underlying the differential susceptibility of chronic asthma to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and other viral infections are currently unclear. By revisiting transcriptomic data from patients with Th2 low versus Th2 high asthma, as well as mild, moderate, and severe asthmatics, we characterized the changes in expression of human coronavirus and influenza viral entry genes relative to sex, airway location, and disease endotype. We found sexual dimorphism in the expression of SARS-CoV-2-related genes ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and SLC6A19. ACE2 receptor downregulation occurred specifically in females in Th2 high asthma, while proteases broadly assisting coronavirus and influenza viral entry, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4, were highly upregulated in both sexes. Overall, changes in SARS-CoV-2-related gene expression were specific to the Th2 high molecular endotype of asthma and different by asthma severity and airway location. The downregulation of ACE2 (COVID-19, SARS) and ANPEP (HCoV-229E) viral receptors wascorrelated with loss of club and ciliated cells in Th2 high asthma. Meanwhile, the increase in DPP4 (MERS-CoV), ST3GAL4, and ST6GAL1 (influenza) was associated with increased goblet and basal activated cells. Overall, this study elucidates sex, airway location, disease endotype, and changes in epithelial heterogeneity as potential factors underlying asthmatic susceptibility, or lack thereof, to SARS-CoV-2.

34221211	Concurrent COVID-19 infection in children with acute appendicitis: A report of three cases. Literature describing patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection with acute appendicitis in pediatric patients is growing, and understanding the clinical picture of such patients is relevant in their treatment. We report 3 male children who were surgically treated for acute appendicitis and had concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our first patient was a 12-year-old male who presented with symptoms indicative of appendicitis but no respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19 (eg cough, shortness of breath). Laboratory evaluation revealed leukopenia and an elevated C-reactive protein; imaging was consistent with acute appendicitis and an acute pulmonary viral infection. Though he lacked diffuse peritonitis on physical examination or a leukocytosis, he was found to have perforated appendicitis in the operating room. Our second patient was another 12-year-old male whose suspected appendicitis was confirmed via ultrasound and surgery. He tested positive for COVID-19 1 month prior and he continued to test positive for infection on admission without any associated respiratory symptoms. Our third patient was a 13-year-old patient who also presented with symptomatic acute appendicitis without apparent COVID-19 manifestations. These cases provide further examples of pediatric patients with concomitant acute appendicitis and COVID-19 infection, namely an unusual presentation of perforated appendicitis with asymptomatic COVID-19-related pulmonary infection and the more common acute appendicitis with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection.

34203738	"Viral Dynamics and Real-Time RT-PCR Ct Values Correlation with Disease Severity in COVID-19. Real-time RT-PCR is considered the gold standard confirmatory test for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, many scientists disagree, and it is essential to understand that several factors and variables can cause a false-negative test. In this context, cycle threshold (Ct) values are being utilized to diagnose or predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. This practice has a significant clinical utility as Ct values can be correlated with the viral load. In addition, Ct values have a strong correlation with multiple haematological and biochemical markers. However, it is essential to consider that Ct values might be affected by pre-analytic, analytic, and post-analytical variables such as collection technique, specimen type, sampling time, viral kinetics, transport and storage conditions, nucleic acid extraction, viral RNA load, primer designing, real-time PCR efficiency, and Ct value determination method. Therefore, understanding the interpretation of Ct values and other influential factors could play a crucial role in interpreting viral load and disease severity. In several clinical studies consisting of small or large sample sizes, several discrepancies exist regarding a significant positive correlation between the Ct value and disease severity in COVID-19. In this context, a revised review of the literature has been conducted to fill the knowledge gaps regarding the correlations between Ct values and severity/fatality rates of patients with COVID-19. Various databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched up to April 2021 by using keywords including ""RT-PCR or viral load"", ""SARS-CoV-2 and RT-PCR"", ""Ct value and viral load"", ""Ct value or COVID-19"". Research articles were extracted and selected independently by the authors and included in the present review based on their relevance to the study. The current narrative review explores the correlation of Ct values with mortality, disease progression, severity, and infectivity. We also discuss the factors that can affect these values, such as collection technique, type of swab, sampling method, etc."	Diagnosis
34226854	Sweden's coronavirus strategy: The Public Health Agency and the sites of controversy. In contrast to the vast majority of Western countries, Sweden left large segments of the society open instead of imposing a lockdown to combat the spread of the coronavirus. As a result, the Swedish COVID-19 measures, largely devised by its expert agency on health, garnered widespread international attention. Despite the global interest in the corona strategy of the Public Health Agency of Sweden (PHAS), there are currently no systematic studies on their COVID-19 policy. The present investigation focuses on the controversies that have characterized PHAS' work with reference to risk assessments, facemasks, voluntarism, testing, and the protection of the elderly during the pandemic. Overall, this inquiry demonstrates that PHAS' risk assessments were initially overly optimistic and their facemask recommendations in conflict with large segments of the scientific community for an extensive period. Yet, their voluntary measures worked moderately well. In their testing, PHAS did not manage to deliver on their promises in time, whereas several measures implemented to protect the elderly were deemed inadequate and late.	Prevention
34290496	"DEELIG: A Deep Learning Approach to Predict Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity. Protein-ligand binding prediction has extensive biological significance. Binding affinity helps in understanding the degree of protein-ligand interactions and is a useful measure in drug design. Protein-ligand docking using virtual screening and molecular dynamic simulations are required to predict the binding affinity of a ligand to its cognate receptor. Performing such analyses to cover the entire chemical space of small molecules requires intense computational power. Recent developments using deep learning have enabled us to make sense of massive amounts of complex data sets where the ability of the model to ""learn"" intrinsic patterns in a complex plane of data is the strength of the approach. Here, we have incorporated convolutional neural networks to find spatial relationships among data to help us predict affinity of binding of proteins in whole superfamilies toward a diverse set of ligands without the need of a docked pose or complex as user input. The models were trained and validated using a stringent methodology for feature extraction. Our model performs better in comparison to some existing methods used widely and is suitable for predictions on high-resolution protein crystal (2.5 A) and nonpeptide ligand as individual inputs. Our approach to network construction and training on protein-ligand data set prepared in-house has yielded significant insights. We have also tested DEELIG on few COVID-19 main protease-inhibitor complexes relevant to the current public health scenario. DEELIG-based predictions can be incorporated in existing databases including RSCB PDB, PDBMoad, and PDBbind in filling missing binding affinity data for protein-ligand complexes."	Mechanism;Treatment
34287344	Sensitive and Specific Immunohistochemistry Protocol for Nucleocapsid Protein from All Common SARS-CoV-2 Virus Strains in Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin Embedded Tissues. Human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening and highly contagious disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in tissues and cells of COVID-19 patients will support investigations of the biologic behavior and tissue and cell tropism of this virus. We identified commercially available affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies raised against nucleocapsid and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that provide sensitive and specific detection of the virus by immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Two immunohistochemistry protocols are presented that are mutually validated by the matched detection patterns of the two distinct viral antigens in virus-infected cells within autopsy lung tissue of COVID-19 deceased patients. Levels of nucleocapsid protein in the lungs of COVID-19 decedents, as measured by quantitative histo-cytometry of immunohistochemistry images, showed an excellent log-linear relationship with levels of viral nucleocapsid RNA levels, as measured by qRT-PCR. Importantly, since the nucleocapsid protein sequence is conserved across all known viral strains, the nucleocapsid immunohistochemistry protocol is expected to recognize all common variants of SARS-CoV-2. Negative controls include autopsy lung tissues from patients who died from non-COVID-19 respiratory disease and control rabbit immunoglobulin. Sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human tissues will provide insights into viral tissue and cell distribution and load in patients with active infection, as well as provide insight into the clearance rate of virus in later COVID-19 disease stages. The protocols are also expected to be readily transferable to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins in tissues of experimental animal models or animals suspected to serve as viral reservoirs.

34286876	Cardiac involvement in MRI in young population after COVID-19: A single tertiary center experience. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) causes morbidity and mortality in an increasing number of people worldwide. Although it mainly affects the respiratory system, it influences all organs, including the heart. It is associated with a broad spectrum of widespread cardiovascular problems ranging from mild myocardial injury to fulminant myocarditis. We aimed to evaluate the presence and prevalence of cardiac involvement in asymptomatic or symptomatic patients after they recovered from COVID 19 infection. METHODS: A total of 100 consecutive patients with COVID-19 proven by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), under 40 years of age and without any known additional chronic diseases were analyzed retrospectively for cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) results and symptoms. RESULTS: Cardiac involvement was detected in 49 out of 100 patients on CMR imaging. In the cardiac involvement group, the number of patients with chest pain and/or dyspnea was 41 (84%), which was statistically significant (p = 0.001). Twenty-four patients (47%) in the without cardiac involvement group were asymptomatic and this was also statistically significant (p = 0.001). LV ejection fraction was statistically significantly lower in the group with cardiac involvement (61% vs 66%, p = 0.001). LV stroke volume and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) were statistically significantly lower in patients with cardiac involvement (p = 0.028 and p = 0.019, respectively). CONCLUSION: Based on single center experience, myocardial involvement is common in symptomatic patients after COVID-19. More studies are needed for long-term side effects and clinical results in these patients.	Diagnosis
34369194	Temporal variations in COVID-19: an epidemiological discussion with a practical application. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize the temporal variation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and mortality as a possible tool to monitor and control the spread of this disease. METHODS: We analyzed cyclicity and synchronicity in cases of COVID-19 infection and time series of deaths using Fourier transform, its inverse method, and statistical treatments. Epidemiological indices (e.g., case fatality rate) were used to quantify the observations in the time series. The possible causes of short-term variations are reviewed. RESULTS: We observed that were both short-term and long-term variations in the COVID-19 time series. The short cycles were 7 days and synchronized among all countries. This periodicity is believed to be caused by weekly cycles in community social factors, combined with diagnostic and reporting cycles. This could also be related to virus-host-community dynamics. CONCLUSION: The observed synchronized weekly cycles could serve as herd defense by providing a form of social distancing in time. The effect of such temporal distancing could be enhanced if combined with spatial distancing. Integrated spatiotemporal distancing is therefore recommended to optimize infection control strategies, taking into account the quiescent and active intervals of COVID-19.	Prevention
34199506	Description and Analysis of Cytokine Storm in Registered COVID-19 Clinical Trials: A Systematic Review. The purpose of this systematic review was to describe the characteristics of clinical trials that focused on COVID-19 patients with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and the variability in CRS definitions. Two authors independently searched three clinical trial registries and included interventional clinical trials on COVID-19 hospitalized patients that required at least one elevated inflammatory biomarker. Relevant data, including the type and cutoff of the measured biomarker, oxygen/respiratory criteria, fever, radiologic criteria, and medications, were summarized. A total of 47 clinical trials were included. The included studies considered the following criteria: oxygen/respiratory criteria in 42 trials (89%), radiologic criteria in 29 trials (62%), and fever in 6 trials (18%). Serum ferritin was measured in 35 trials (74%), CRP in 34 trials (72%), D-dimer in 26 trials (55%), LDH in 24 trials (51%), lymphocyte count in 14 trials (30%), and IL-6 in 8 trials (17%). The cutoff values were variable for the included biomarkers. The most commonly used medications were tocilizumab, in 15 trials (32%), and anakinra in 10 trials (24.4%). This systematic review found high variability in CRS definitions and associated biomarker cutoff values in COVID-19 clinical trials. We call for a standardized definition of CRS, especially in COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34210259	Hyperimmune plasma in three immuno-deficient patients affected by non-severe, prolonged COVID-19: a single-center experience. BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma (CP) and hyperimmune plasma (HP) are passive immunotherapies consisting in the infusion of plasma from recovered people into infected patients. Following pre-existing evidence in many other viral diseases, such as SARS, MERS and Ebola, CP and HP have also been proposed for the treatment of COVID-19. Nevertheless, due to the lack of large, well-designed, clinical trials, no clear-cut guidelines exist about what subtype of patient CP and HP should be administered to. CASE PRESENTATION: We have reported the cases of 3 patients, all immunosuppressed and affected by non-severe, prolonged COVID-19. They were treated with HP, whose neutralizing titer was higher than 1/80. The first patient was a 55-year-old male, who had undergone lung transplant. He was under therapy with Tacrolimus and developed non-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV2. The second patient was a 77-year-old female, affected by follicular lymphoma. She had tested positive for SARS-CoV2 after 6 months. The third was a 60-year-old patient, affected by chronic leukemia. He did not develop antibodies after 2-month disease. All 3 patients received HP and had tested negative for SARS-CoV2 within 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: Despite encouraging initial data, no strong evidence exist in support of CP and HP to treat COVID-19. In our experience, although limited due to the reduced number of patients, we found a good safety and efficacy of HP in 3 immuno-deficient subjects. Further data are needed in order to assess whether this subtype of patients may particularly benefit from passive immunization.	Case Report
34285496	Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Substance Use Disorder Treatment: Findings from a Survey of Specialty Providers in California. Background: As the coronavirus pandemic public health emergency begins to ebb in the United States, policymakers and providers need to evaluate how the addiction treatment system functioned during the public health emergency and draw lessons for future emergencies. One important question is whether the pandemic curtailed the use of addiction treatment and the extent to which telehealth was able to mitigate access barriers. Methods: To begin to answer this question, we conducted a survey of specialty addiction treatment providers in California from June 2020 through July 2020. The survey focused specifically on provider organizations that served Medicaid beneficiaries. Results: Of the 133 respondents, 50% reported a decrease in patients since the stay-at-home order in March 2020, with the largest decline among new patients, and 58% said more patients were relapsing. Eighty-one percent of providers said that telemedicine use had increased since the stay-at-home order. Most said that telemedicine had moderately (48%) or completely (30%) addressed access barriers. Conclusion: More efforts are needed to ensure that patients, and in particular new patients, receive addiction treatment during public health emergencies.	Prevention
34377558	Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Hemostatic Disorders in COVID-19 Patients. The novel coronavirus infection named COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and it has been responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in scores of countries. At the time this article was being written, the number of infected and deceased patients continued to grow worldwide. Most patients with severe forms of the disease suffer from pneumonia and pulmonary insufficiency; in many cases, the disease is generalized and causes multiple organ failures and a dysfunction of physiological systems. One of the most serious and prognostically ominous complications from COVID-19 is coagulopathy, in particular, decompensated hypercoagulability with the risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation. In most cases, local and diffuse macro- and microthromboses are present, a condition which causes multiple-organ failure and thromboembolic complications. The causes and pathogenic mechanisms of coagulopathy in COVID-19 remain largely unclear, but they are associated with systemic inflammation, including the so-called cytokine storm. Despite the relatively short period of the ongoing pandemic, laboratory signs of serious hemostatic disorders have been identified and measures for specific prevention and correction of thrombosis have been developed. This review discusses the causes of COVID-19 coagulopathies and the associated complications, as well as possible approaches to their early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

34209271	Eating Habits during the COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy: The Nutritional and Lifestyle Side Effects of the Pandemic. To limit the spread of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a nationwide lockdown started in Italy in March 2020. In this unpredictable situation, a cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire was carried out by the Observatory on Food Surplus, Recovery and Waste of CREA Food and Nutrition Centre. The aim of this work was to evaluate how Italian habits changed during this period, the determinants of changes, and the effect on food waste prevention. In a sample of 2678 respondents, 62% showed low Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (AMD). During lockdown many of participants improved the quality of their diet, increasing their consumption of fruit (24.4%), vegetables (28.5%), legumes (22.1%), nuts (12%), and fish or shellfish (14%). Unfavorable changes were observed with the excessive consumption of sweets or pastries (36.9%) and comfort foods (22.7%), and a lack of physical activity (37.2%). The main novelty of this study was the examination of dietary changes identified by a cluster analysis. Respondents with generally high AMD improved their eating habits, while the habits of the respondents with generally low AMD remained unchanged. In addition, nearly 80% of respondents were sensitive to food waste. The study provides a useful contribution to the debate on nutritional recommendations in case of further lockdown.	Prevention
34343115	Delayed RT-PCR Time-To-Positivity in an adult with SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Early diagnosis is among the crucial measures to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To date, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, but various factors can affect its performance leading to false negative results. Hereby we present a patient with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and had multiple negative RT-PCR results over 5 days. A 22-year-old woman presented with fever, dry cough, nausea, myalgia, headache, and mild dyspnea. Eleven days before, she was in close contact with her father who had tested positive for COVID-19. RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were performed on day 8, 9, and 12 of illness which all came back negative even after she started having a worsening dyspnea and showing an increased lung opacity from radiographic findings on day 11 of illness. Interestingly, her rapid antibody test (VivaDiag COVID-19 IgM/IgG rapid test by VivaChek Biotech (HangZhou,China) was positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig M and Ig G. Due to the worsening condition, she was referred to a tertiary hospital where her RT PCR result was positive on day 13 of illness. After 28 days from her first symptom, she was discharged from the hospital with improved symptoms and chest X-ray. As conclusions, in patients with high suspicion of COVID-19, repeat swab tests are mandatory if previous tests were negative. The diagnosis and treatment plan of COVID-19 should not solely be based on RT-PCR, but also consider the patient's history, symptoms, laboratory result, and radiographic findings.	Case Report
34378840	Gastrointestinal symptoms and healthcare utilization have increased among patients with functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to unprecedented disruptions in healthcare. Functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders (FGIMD) are associated with significant healthcare utilization. The clinical implications of these healthcare disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical outcomes in patients with FGIMD are unclear. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with three common FGIMD (irritable bowel syndrome [IBS], gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia [FD]) tested for SARS-CoV-2 to describe alterations in gastrointestinal symptoms, medication use, and healthcare utilization during and before the pandemic and factors associated with COVID-19. KEY RESULTS: The prevalence of COVID-19 during the pandemic (03/2020-09/2020) was 3.20% (83/2592) among patients with FGIMD, 3.62% in IBS (57/1574), 3.07% in gastroparesis (23/749), and 2.44% in FD (29/1187) at our institution. Patients with FGIMD had increased abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and weight loss (p < 0.001) along with increased proton pump inhibitor, H2 blocker, and opioid use (p < 0.0001). Both inpatient hospitalizations and outpatient visits (p < 0.0001) and number of diagnostic tests including cross-sectional imaging (p = 0.002), and upper and lower endoscopies (p < 0.0001) were significantly higher during the pandemic as compared to 6 months prior. Diarrhea-predominant IBS was positively (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.34-4.19, p = 0.003) associated with COVID-19, whereas functional dyspepsia was negatively (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27-0.79, p = 0.004) associated. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Patients with common functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders have reported more gastrointestinal symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic with concurrent increased medication use and healthcare utilization.

34214101	A machine learning based exploration of COVID-19 mortality risk. Early prediction of patient mortality risks during a pandemic can decrease mortality by assuring efficient resource allocation and treatment planning. This study aimed to develop and compare prognosis prediction machine learning models based on invasive laboratory and noninvasive clinical and demographic data from patients' day of admission. Three Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were developed and compared using invasive, non-invasive, and both groups. The results suggested that non-invasive features could provide mortality predictions that are similar to the invasive and roughly on par with the joint model. Feature inspection results from SVM-RFE and sparsity analysis displayed that, compared with the invasive model, the non-invasive model can provide better performances with a fewer number of features, pointing to the presence of high predictive information contents in several non-invasive features, including SPO2, age, and cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, while the invasive model was able to provide better mortality predictions for the imminent future, non-invasive features displayed better performance for more distant expiration intervals. Early mortality prediction using non-invasive models can give us insights as to where and with whom to intervene. Combined with novel technologies, such as wireless wearable devices, these models can create powerful frameworks for various medical assignments and patient triage.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34350810	Epidemiological and co-infection characteristics of common human coronaviruses in Shanghai, 2015-2020: a retrospective observational study. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a major challenge worldwide. However, the epidemic potential of common human coronaviruses (HCoVs) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the epidemiological and co-infection characteristics of common HCoVs in individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). This retrospective, observational, multicentre study used data collected from patients admitted to nine sentinel hospitals with ILI and SARI from January 2015 through December 2020 in Shanghai, China. We prospectively tested patients for a total of 22 respiratory pathogens using multi-real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of the 4541 patients tested, 40.37% (1833/4541) tested positive for respiratory pathogens and 3.59% (163/4541) tested positive for common HCoVs. HCoV infection was more common in the non-endemic season for respiratory pathogens (odds ratio: 2.33, 95% confidence interval: 1.64-3.31). HCoV-OC43 (41.72%, 68/163) was the most common type of HCoV detected. The co-infection rate was 31.29% (51/163) among 163 HCoV-positive cases, with HCoV-229E (53.13%, 17/32), the HCoV type that was most frequently associated with co-infection. Respiratory pathogens responsible for co-infections with HCoVs included parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A virus, and adenovirus. Furthermore, we identified one patient co-infected with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63/HKU1. The prevalence of common HCoVs remains low in ILI/SARI cases, in Shanghai. However, the seasonal pattern of HCoVs may be opposite to that of other respiratory pathogens. Moreover, HCoVs are likely to co-exist with specific respiratory pathogens. The potential role of co-infections with HCoVs and other pathogenic microorganisms in infection and pathogenesis of ILI and SARI warrants further study.	Diagnosis
34374799	"[Mild COVID-19 disease in healthcare workers at a German university clinic : The ""first wave"" at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf]. BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers are among the most exposed and potentially most threatened populations of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Despite some reports on numbers of infections with SARS-CoV2 in German healthcare workers, the courses of their clinical presentation when affected by COVID-19 are not well described. OBJECTIVE: In this contribution, characteristics and progressions of infected cases among healthcare workers at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic will be presented. METHODS: Between 1 July and 28 July 2020, 67 healthcare workers, who previously tested positive for SARS-CoV2 via PCR, were invited via Email to participate in an anonymous online questionnaire; 39 persons participated. RESULTS: Participants (58%) were mostly </=39 years old (64%) and female (70%). Most healthcare workers were involved in direct patient management (85%), including contact with SARS-CoV2 positive patients (62%). All participants reported acute symptoms with a median duration of 19 days. The most frequent symptoms were fatigue (85%), anosmia (67%), cough (64%), headache (62%), and shortness of breath (51%). The disease course was mostly mild with low admission rates (5%). Ongoing symptoms lasting more than four weeks post-symptom-onset, particularly anosmia, fatigue, and shortness of breath, were reported by 38%. This group more frequently had pre-existing conditions (53% vs. 12%, p= 0.010), specifically hypertension (27% vs. 4%, p= 0.062). DISCUSSION: Healthcare workers reported mostly mild courses of COVID-19 despite increased contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, some reported persistent symptoms months after infection."

34336483	Hereditary Chorea Associated With and Aggravated by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Chorea is caused by a number of conditions, including genetic, metabolic derangements, infections, drugs, toxins, tumors, and disorders of the immune and inflammatory system of the body. Huntington's disease (HD) is the most common genetic cause of chorea. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition. Common symptoms include oral ulcers, joint pain, malar or discoid rashes, photosensitivity, and blood dyscrasias. It can involve the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain. SLE can cause neuropsychiatric manifestations like psychosis, seizures, headache, confusion, and stroke. Chorea is a known symptom of SLE. HD is now recognized to involve more than one system and is associated with a number of comorbid conditions. We report the first case of hereditary choreiform disorder associated with and aggravated by SLE. This is also the first case report of probable Huntington disease from Balochistan, Pakistan. We report a 19-year-old girl with choreiform disorder and a family history of chorea. Choreiform disorder was present in her paternal grandmother and uncles. She presented with fever, cough, and aggravation of choreiform movements of upper and lower limbs for 10 days. She also complained of pain in the small joints of her hands and feet, oral ulcers, hair loss, and aggravation of choreiform movements for two and half months. Probable differential diagnoses of HD, Wilson's disease, and other types of hereditary chorea, aggravated by infections, SLE, or Covid-19, were made. Her initial lab results revealed pancytopenia, increased D-dimers and serum ferritin, positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA). Her C3 and C4 complement factors were low. The rest of the lab test results, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coronavirus disease (COVID-19), blood culture, and malaria, were negative. Thus, a diagnosis of hereditary chorea associated with and aggravated by SLE was made. Hereditary choreiform disorders can be associated with and aggravated by autoimmune conditions like SLE. Thus, it is recommended to be vigilant and have a low threshold for diagnosing co-existing autoimmune conditions like SLE in patients with hereditary choreiform disorder.	Case Report
34359986	Role of Multifunctional Cytoskeletal Filaments in Coronaviridae Infections: Therapeutic Opportunities for COVID-19 in a Nutshell. A novel coronavirus discovered in 2019 is a new strain of the Coronaviridae family (CoVs) that had not been previously identified in humans. It is known as SARS-CoV-2 for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, whilst COVID-19 is the name of the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 emerged over one year ago and still haunts the human community throughout the world, causing both healthcare and socioeconomic problems. SARS-CoV-2 is spreading with many uncertainties about treatment and prevention: the data available are limited and there are few randomized controlled trial data on the efficacy of antiviral or immunomodulatory agents. SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants are considered as unique within the Coronaviridae family insofar as they spread rapidly and can have severe effects on health. Although the scientific world has been succeeding in developing vaccines and medicines to combat COVID-19, the appearance and the spread of new, more aggressive mutants are posing extra problems for treatment. Nevertheless, our understanding of pandemics is increasing significantly due to this outbreak and is leading to the development of many different pharmacological, immunological and other treatments. This Review focuses on a subset of COVID-19 research, primarily the cytoskeleton-related physiological and pathological processes in which coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are intimately involved. The discovery of the exact mechanisms of the subversion of host cells by SARS-CoV-2 is critical to the validation of specific drug targets and effective treatments.	Mechanism;Treatment
34352402	Validation of an on-screen application-based measurement of shoulder range of motion (ROM) over telehealth medium. INTRODUCTION: Shoulder range of motion (ROM) assessment is vital for the follow-up evaluation of the operated patients and the outcome-based research studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy and reliability of a remote on-screen application(app)-based method of shoulder ROM measurement through telehealth medium. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A consultant shoulder surgeon, a board-certified orthopedic resident and a medical graduate doctor served as the examiners. The cohort consisted of 24 healthy volunteers and 16 symptomatic patients with expectant shoulder ROM deficits. The shoulder ROM was first examined physically using the goniometer in the clinic and then over the Zoom remote conferencing using the protractor extension app of the chrome browser. RESULTS: Instrument validity was examined by comparing the goniometer method with the protractor app-based method of the expert shoulder consultant using Bland-Altman analysis. It showed only minor mean differences for the healthy volunteers and the patients: elevation (2.0 degrees ,5.0 degrees ), abduction (2.0 degrees ,3.0 degrees ), external rotation with elbow adducted (ER1) (1.9 degrees ,0.2 degrees ), external rotation with elbow abducted at 90 degrees (ER2) (0.4 degrees ,4 degrees ) and internal rotation with elbow abducted at 90 degrees (IR) (2.3 degrees ,1.2 degrees ) respectively; with their limits of agreement (LOA) that were below the well-established minimum clinically important differences (MCID) values. The intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) values varied between 0.83 and 096 for volunteers and between 0.90 and 0.98 for the patients, which meant an excellent correlation between the two methods. The interobserver reliability between two examiners for the protractor app-based method as evaluated by ICC scores was excellent. It ranged between 0.86 to 0.98 for the volunteers and between 0.88 to 0.99 for the patients. Comparison of the protractor app-based method with the gold standard goniometer method for the resident and the graduate doctor showed excellent ICC values. CONCLUSION: Protractor app-based method of measuring shoulder ROM over telehealth medium is accurate and reliable compared to the clinical goniometer method. This validated method can be used during remote telehealth consultation with significant benefits of saving patients travel and time during COVID-19 and even later.	Prevention
34224053	Improving the Efficacy of Regulatory T Cell Therapy. Autoimmunity is caused by an unbalanced immune system, giving rise to a variety of organ-specific to system disorders. Patients with autoimmune diseases are commonly treated with broad-acting immunomodulatory drugs, with the risk of severe side effects. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have the inherent capacity to induce peripheral tolerance as well as tissue regeneration and are therefore a prime candidate to use as cell therapy in patients with autoimmune disorders. (Pre)clinical studies using Treg therapy have already established safety and feasibility, and some show clinical benefits. However, Tregs are known to be functionally impaired in autoimmune diseases. Therefore, ex vivo manipulation to boost and stably maintain their suppressive function is necessary when considering autologous transplantation. Similar to autoimmunity, severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by an exaggerated immune reaction and altered Treg responses. In light of this, Treg-based therapies are currently under investigation to treat severe COVID-19. This review provides a detailed overview of the current progress and clinical challenges of Treg therapy for autoimmune and hyperinflammatory diseases, with a focus on recent successes of ex vivo Treg manipulation.

34207745	The Association of Low Vitamin K Status with Mortality in a Cohort of 138 Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19. It has recently been hypothesized that vitamin K could play a role in COVID-19. We aimed to test the hypotheses that low vitamin K status is a common characteristic of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to population controls and that low vitamin K status predicts mortality in COVID-19 patients. In a cohort of 138 COVID-19 patients and 138 population controls, we measured plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), which reflects the functional vitamin K status in peripheral tissue. Forty-three patients died within 90 days from admission. In patients, levels of dp-ucMGP differed significantly between survivors (mean 877; 95% CI: 778; 995) and non-survivors (mean 1445; 95% CI: 1148; 1820). Furthermore, levels of dp-ucMGP (pmol/L) were considerably higher in patients (mean 1022; 95% CI: 912; 1151) compared to controls (mean 509; 95% CI: 485; 540). Cox regression survival analysis showed that increasing levels of dp-ucMGP (reflecting low vitamin K status) were associated with higher mortality risk (sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.49, 95% CI: 1.03; 2.24). The association attenuated and became statistically insignificant after adjustment for co-morbidities (sex, age, CVD, diabetes, BMI, and eGFR adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.22, 95% CI: 0.82; 1.80). In conclusion, we found that low vitamin K status was associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 in sex- and age-adjusted analyses, but not in analyses additionally adjusted for co-morbidities. Randomized clinical trials would be needed to clarify a potential role, if any, of vitamin K in the course of COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34284214	"Restoring NK cells functionality via cytokine activation enhances cetuximab-mediated NK-cell ADCC: A promising therapeutic tool for HCC patients. Natural Killer (NK) cells are considered the first line of defense against viral infections and tumors. Several factors affect NK cytotoxic activity rendering it dysfunctional and thereby impeding the ability to scavenge abnormal cells as a part of immune escaping mechanisms induced by different types of cancers. NK cells play a crucial role augmenting the activity of various types of anticancer mAb since dysfunctional NK cells are the main reason for the low response to these therapies. To this light, we examined the phenotypic characters of the circulating NK cells isolated from HCC patients compared to healthy controls. Then, dysfunctional NK cells, from HCC patients, were reactivated with cytokines cocktail and their cytotoxic activity with the anti-EGFR mAb ""cetuximab"" was investigated. This showed a downregulation of patients NK cells activating receptors (NKP30, NKP46, NKG2D and CD16) as well as CD56 and up-regulation of NKG2A inhibitory receptor. We also reported an increase in aberrant CD56(-) NK cells subset in peripheral blood of HCC patients compared to healthy controls. Thus, confirming the dysfunctionality of peripheral NK cells isolated from HCC patients. Cytokines re-activation of those NK cells lead to upregulation of NK activating receptors and downregulation of inhibitory receptor. Moreover, the percentage of aberrant CD56(-) NK cells subset was reduced. Here, we proved that advanced HCC patients have an increased percentage of more immature and noncytotoxic NK cell subsets in their peripheral blood, which might account for the low cytotoxicity noticed in those patients. A significant improvement in the cytotoxicity against HCC was noticed upon using reactivated NK cells combined with cetuximab. Therefore, this study highlights the potential recruitment of NK immune cells along with cetuximab to enhance cytotoxicity against HCC."	Mechanism;Treatment
34226893	Comparative performance of SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow antigen tests and association with detection of infectious virus in clinical specimens: a single-centre laboratory evaluation study. Background: Lateral flow devices (LFDs) for rapid antigen testing are set to become a cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 mass community testing, although their reduced sensitivity compared with PCR has raised questions of how well they identify infectious cases. Understanding their capabilities and limitations is, therefore, essential for successful implementation. We evaluated six commercial LFDs and assessed their correlation with infectious virus culture and PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values. Methods: In a single-centre, laboratory evaluation study, we did a head-to-head comparison of six LFDs commercially available in the UK: Innova Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test, Spring Healthcare SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test Cassette, E25Bio Rapid Diagnostic Test, Encode SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test Device, SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test Cassette, and SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Fluorescence Antigen Test. We estimated the specificities and sensitivities of the LFDs using stored naso-oropharyngeal swabs collected at St Thomas' Hospital (London, UK) for routine diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing by real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR). Swabs were from inpatients and outpatients from all departments of St Thomas' Hospital, and from health-care staff (all departments) and their household contacts. SARS-CoV-2-negative swabs from the same population (confirmed by RT-rtPCR) were used for comparative specificity determinations. All samples were collected between March 23 and Oct 27, 2020. We determined the limit of detection (LOD) for each test using viral plaque-forming units (PFUs) and viral RNA copy numbers of laboratory-grown SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, LFDs were selected to assess the correlation of antigen test result with RT-rtPCR Ct values and positive viral culture in Vero E6 cells. This analysis included longitudinal swabs from five infected inpatients with varying disease severities. Furthermore, the sensitivities of available LFDs were assessed in swabs (n=23; collected from Dec 4, 2020, to Jan 12, 2021) confirmed to be positive (RT-rtPCR and whole-genome sequencing) for the B.1.1.7 variant, which was the dominant genotype in the UK at the time of study completion. Findings: All LFDs showed high specificity (>/=98.0%), except for the E25Bio test (86.0% [95% CI 77.9-99.9]), and most tests reliably detected 50 PFU/test (equivalent SARS-CoV-2 N gene Ct value of 23.7, or RNA copy number of 3 x 10(6)/mL). Sensitivities of the LFDs on clinical samples ranged from 65.0% (55.2-73.6) to 89.0% (81.4-93.8). These sensitivities increased to greater than 90% for samples with Ct values of lower than 25 for all tests except the SureScreen fluorescence (SureScreen-F) test. Positive virus culture was identified in 57 (40.4%) of 141 samples; 54 (94.7%) of the positive cultures were from swabs with Ct values lower than 25. Among the three LFDs selected for detailed comparisons (the tests with highest sensitivity [Innova], highest specificity [Encode], and alternative technology [SureScreen-F]), sensitivity of the LFDs increased to at least 94.7% when only including samples with detected viral growth. Longitudinal studies of RT-rtPCR-positive samples (tested with Innova, Encode, and both SureScreen-F and the SureScreen visual [SureScreen-V] test) showed that most of the tests identified all infectious samples as positive. Test performance (assessed for Innova and SureScreen-V) was not affected when reassessed on swabs positive for the UK variant B.1.1.7. Interpretation: In this comprehensive comparison of antigen LFDs and virus infectivity, we found a clear relationship between Ct values, quantitative culture of infectious virus, and antigen LFD positivity in clinical samples. Our data support regular testing of target groups with LFDs to supplement the current PCR testing capacity, which would help to rapidly identify infected individuals in situations in which they would otherwise go undetected.

34208141	The Role of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a new potentially life-threatening disease that is related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study is to reveal the clinical and laboratory results of MIS-C and the role of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in its treatment. Clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of the patients who were admitted to the pediatric ward and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary hospital with a diagnosis of MIS-C between April 2020 and March 2021 were included in the study. Forty-one patients were admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of MIS-C. Twenty-one (51.2%) patients were admitted to the PICU. Six patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation (14.6%), 10 patients (24.4%) TPE and 3 patients (7.3%) needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The patients were grouped according to need for PICU admission (Group 1: no need for PICU, Group 2: need for PICU admission). Group 2 had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), ferritin, D-dimer, pro-B type natriuretic peptide (pro BNP) and lactate (p < 0.05). Hyponatremia found to be an independent risk factor for inpatient MIS-C in the PICU. We think that dynamic laboratory trending is beneficial in determining the need for PICU admission and TPE may be effective in critically ill patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment

34286205	Principles and practice of deploying a flexible physician workforce for COVID-19 care wards from a Dutch hospital. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the attainment of the required hospital workforce is extremely challenging; with a requirement to create surge capacity for COVID-19 care and to ensure and sustain regular hospital care. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic demands the deployment of a flexible physician workforce for the cohort wards in hospitals. This can be successfully be organised and managed if some key principles are followed. Physicians have the ability to practice their general, not specialised, medical skills. COVID-19 specific medical education, re- and upskilling can be necessary. This approach for the future physician workforce may be applicable in several national healthcare systems. Solidarity, flexibility and transparency within the medical staff are the cornerstones for a successful deployment of a physician flex pool in a hospital dealing with a pandemic.	Prevention
34218651	Review of the early reports of the epidemiological characteristics of the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 and its spread worldwide. The variant B.1.1.7 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the RNA virus causing the pandemic more than a year worldwide, was reported from United Kingdom (UK) in late December 2020. It was reported that mortality increases by 65% and transmissibility increases by 70%, which may result in an increase of reproduction number to 1.13-1.55 from 0.75-0.85. To analyze the global increasing trend of the variant B.1.1.7, we extracted results of B.1.1.7 from GISAID on May 11 and May 12, 2021, and conducted a doseresponse regression. It took 47 days to reach 20% and 121 days to reach 50% among the sequence submitted from UK. In Korea, cases of B.1.1.7 have increased since the first report of three cases on December 28, 2020. Positive rate of B.1.1.7 in Korea was 21.6% in the week from May 9 to May 15, 2021. Detection rate of the variants is expected to increase further and new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are emerging, so a close monitoring and control would be maintained for months.	Prevention
34221885	Acute Pulmonary Embolism and Thrombus Entrapped in the Patent Foramen Ovale in a Patient with COVID-19. A 61-year-old patient presented for syncope and a 1-week history of fever. He was diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection without pulmonary injury associated with an intermediate-risk bilateral pulmonary embolism. Computed tomographic scan and transesophageal echography were performed confirming a mobile in-transit embolus, originating from the right cavities and extending to the right ventricle through the patent foramen ovale. The patient underwent a surgical embolectomy without complications. COVID-19 was found to be the only current risk factor in our patient. This could warrant consideration of extending thromboprophylaxis indication to COVID-19 patients with certain criteria even without hospitalization indication or pulmonary injury.	Case Report
34286281	"Awake Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Acute Respiratory Failure. Implantation of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as an alternative to invasive mechanical ventilation, an ""awake approach,"" may facilitate a lung- and diaphragm-protective ventilatory strategies without the associated harms of endotracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and continuous sedation. This report presents the characteristics and outcomes of the patients treated with the awake venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation approach. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Monocenter study. PATIENTS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patients with acute respiratory failure treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation instead of invasive mechanical ventilation from March 2020 to March 2021. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Physiologic and laboratory data were collected at admission to the ICU, prior to and after venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation implantation, and at decannulation. Seven patients were treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation instead of invasive mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemia with a median Pao2/Fio2 ratio at implantation of 76 (interquartile range, 59-92). Four patients in the awake group subsequently required invasive mechanical ventilation, and only one patient (14.3%) died. There were no significant complications attributed venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that in a selected group of patients, an ""awake"" venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation approach is feasible and may result in favorable outcomes."

34338772	Role of ACE2 in pregnancy and potential implications for COVID-19 susceptibility. In times of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2 infection on pregnancy is still unclear. The presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 (ACE2), the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in human placentas indicates that this organ can be vulnerable for viral infection during pregnancy. However, for this to happen, additional molecular processes are critical to allow viral entry in cells, its replication and disease manifestation, particularly in the placenta and/or feto-maternal circulation. Beyond the risk of vertical transmission, COVID-19 is also proposed to deplete ACE2 protein and its biological actions in the placenta. It is postulated that such effects may impair essential processes during placentation and maternal hemodynamic adaptations in COVID-19 pregnancy, features also observed in several disorders of pregnancy. This review gathers information indicating risks and protective features related to ACE2 changes in COVID-19 pregnancies. First, we describe the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection having ACE2 as a main entry door and current evidence of viral infection in the placenta. Further, we discuss the central role of ACE2 in physiological systems such as the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), both active during placentation and hemodynamic adaptations of pregnancy. Significant knowledge gaps are also identified and should be urgently filled to better understand the fate of ACE2 in COVID-19 pregnancies and the potential associated risks. Emerging knowledge will be able to improve the early stratification of high-risk pregnancies with COVID-19 exposure as well as to guide better management and follow-up of these mothers and their children.

34227905	Characteristics of Angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2, type II transmembrane serine protease 2 and 4 in tree shrew indicate it as a potential animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), type II transmembrane serine protease 2 and 4 (TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4) are important receptors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, the full-length tree shrewACE2 gene was cloned and sequenced, and its biological information was analyzed. The expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 in various tissues or organs of the tree shrew were detected. The results showed that the full-length ACE2 gene in tree shrews was 2,786 bp, and its CDS was 2,418 bp, encoding 805 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis based on the CDS of ACE2 revealed that tree shrews were more similar to rabbits (85.93%) and humans (85.47%) but far from mice (82.81%) and rats (82.58%). In silico analysis according to the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor of different species predicted that tree shrews had potential SARS-CoV-2 infection possibility, which was similar to that of rabbits, cats and dogs but significantly higher than that of mice and rats. In addition, various tissues or organs of tree shrews expressed ACE2, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4. Among them, the kidney most highly expressed ACE2, followed by the lung and liver. The esophagus, lung, liver, intestine and kidney had relatively high expression levels of TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4. In general, we reported for the first time the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 in various tissues or organs in tree shrews. Our results revealed that tree shrews could be used as a potential animal model to study the mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Mechanism;Treatment
34199825	Blockchain-Based Traceability System That Ensures Food Safety Measures to Protect Consumer Safety and COVID-19 Free Supply Chains. The world is facing an unprecedented socio-economic crisis caused by the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). The virus is also spreading through the import and export food supply chains. The Chinese authorities have discovered the COVID-19 virus in various imported frozen meat packages. Traceability plays a vital role in food quality and food safety. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides solutions to overseeing environmental conditions, product quality, and product traceability. These solutions are traditionally based on a centralized architecture, which does not guarantee tamper-proof data sharing. The blockchain is an emerging technology that provides tamper-proof data sharing in real-time. This article presents a blockchain-enabled supply chain architecture to ensure the availability of a tamper-proof audit trail. This tamper-proof audit trail helps to make sure that all safety measures are undertaken to minimize the risk of COVID-19 and other bacteria, fungi, and parasites being present in the frozen meat supply chain.

34217413	Measuring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on organized cancer screening and diagnostic follow-up care in Ontario, Canada: A provincial, population-based study. It is essential to quantify the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer screening, including for vulnerable sub-populations, to inform the development of evidence-based, targeted pandemic recovery strategies. We undertook a population-based retrospective observational study in Ontario, Canada to assess the impact of the pandemic on organized cancer screening and diagnostic services, and assess whether patterns of cancer screening service use and diagnostic delay differ across population sub-groups during the pandemic. Provincial health databases were used to identify age-eligible individuals who participated in one or more of Ontario's breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer screening programs from January 1, 2019-December 31, 2020. Ontario's screening programs delivered 951,000 (-41%) fewer screening tests in 2020 than in 2019 and volumes for most programs remained more than 20% below historical levels by the end of 2020. A smaller percentage of cervical screening participants were older (50-59 and 60-69 years) during the pandemic when compared with 2019. Individuals in the oldest age groups and in lower-income neighborhoods were significantly more likely to experience diagnostic delay following an abnormal breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer screening test during the pandemic, and individuals with a high probability of living on a First Nation reserve were significantly more likely to experience diagnostic delay following an abnormal fecal test. Ongoing monitoring and management of backlogs must continue. Further evaluation is required to identify populations for whom access to cancer screening and diagnostic care has been disproportionately impacted and quantify impacts of these service disruptions on cancer incidence, stage, and mortality. This information is critical to pandemic recovery efforts that are aimed at achieving equitable and timely access to cancer screening-related care.	Prevention
34338841	[Ischemic stroke in coronavirus disease 2019]. This article reports two cases of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in which occlusion of large cerebral arteries occurred. These occurred in a female patient in the early stage of COVID-19 and in the second case in the late stage. One female patient could be successfully treated with i.v. thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. Coagulopathy in the course of COVID-19 can result in severe stroke with poor outcome even in younger patients. With respect to the etiology of arterial occlusions (COVID-19-induced hypercoagulopathy, cardiomyopathy, vasculitis) there is a necessity for further research.	Case Report
34217985	Grip strength as a predictor of disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: Grip strength is one of the main components for the physical functioning in sarcopenia and physical frailty. OBJECTIVES: To explore the role of grip strength measurement at admission for predicting disease severity in COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic data, smoking status, comorbidities, COVID-19 related symptoms, grip strength, laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings at admission were all noted. Using a Smedley hand dynamometer, the maximum grip strength value (kg) after three measurements on the dominant side was recorded. Low grip strength was defined as two standard deviations below the gender-specific peak mean value of the healthy young adults (<32 kg for males, <19 kg for females). Patients were categorized into three groups according to clinical and CT findings. Severe illness group had pneumonia with a respiratory rate >30/min, oxygen saturation </=90%, or extensive lung involvement in CT. Moderate illness group had pneumonia with CT score </=11. Mild illness group had normal CT findings. RESULTS: The study population included 312 patients (140 F, 172 M). The distribution of mild, moderate and severe disease groups were 36.9%, 51.0% and 12.2%, respectively. Cough, fever, dyspnea, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were most frequent, and C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, and neutrophil levels were highest in the severe group (all p<.05). Absolute grip strength values were lowest and the frequency of having low grip strength were highest in the severe group (both p<.01). Since we found that the significant differences were stemming from the severe group, we combined the mild and moderate group as non-severe, and compared severe vs. non-severe groups with binary logistic regression analyses. When age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, presence of comorbidities and low grip strength, and abnormal laboratory findings were taken into analyses; age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.054 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.020-1.089]), obesity (OR: 2.822 [95% CI: 1.143-6.966]), COPD (OR: 5.699 [95 %CI: 1.231-26.383]), CRP level (OR: 1.023 [95% CI: 1.010-1.036]) and low grip strength (OR: 3.047 [95% CI: 1.146-8.103]) were observed to be independent predictors for severe COVID-19 disease (all p<.05). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the well-known independent risk factors (i.e. age, obesity, COPD, and CRP level), low grip strength independently increased (about three times) the severity of COVID-19.

34347278	Cumulative Adverse Event Reporting of Anaphylaxis After mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) Injections in Japan: The First-Month Report. INTRODUCTION: In mid-February, the nationwide immunization plan for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Japan (at first primarily focused on health professionals) using an mRNA-based vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech). During the phase-in period from February to March, attention was focused on post-vaccination anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid symptoms from the viewpoint of ensuring the safety of the vaccination program. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this report was to provide an update on the status of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid symptoms occurring after vaccination for COVID-19, as reported under the Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) reporting system in Japan. METHODS: The Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) received AEFI reports from health professionals and manufacturers under the reporting system for AEFI after vaccination for COVID-19, which has been in operation since mid-February 2021. Reported AEFIs of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid symptoms were assessed using the Brighton Collaboration Criteria to assess diagnostic certainty. RESULTS: 1-month since Japan started the vaccination program for COVID-19 in February 2021, 578,835 doses have been administered to health professionals, with the PMDA receiving 181 suspected event reports of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid symptoms. In 171 of these 181 cases, women developed these symptoms. Among 181 cases evaluated according to the Brighton Collaboration Criteria, 47 cases (26%) were classified as level 1-3 (reporting rate: 8.1/100,000 doses). CONCLUSION: The results appear similar to reported AEFIs in foreign studies of coronavirus vaccine administration to health professionals, although the reporting rate was higher. Further work is needed to examine the causal relationship of anaphylaxis reactions to coronavirus vaccine administration. Issues of multiple reporting and possible sex/age bias also remain to be analyzed.	Treatment
34285180	A Case of Immune Thrombocytopenia After BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination. BACKGROUND Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an immune response that destroys platelets and increases the risk of bleeding, which can range from bruising to intracranial hemorrhage. ITP is a known complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the first studies of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine, there were no reports of ITP and the incidence of serious adverse events (AEs) was low overall. Here, we present a case of ITP as a complication of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. CASE REPORT Three days after receiving a second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, a 39-year-old woman presented with a petechial rash on her trunk, legs, and arms, and fatigue and muscle aches. At the time of her hospital admission, her platelet count was 1000/microL. A peripheral smear showed profound thrombocytopenia. During the course of the patient's hospitalization, she was treated with 2 units of platelets, 2 infusions of i.v. immunoglobulin, and i.v. methylprednisolone. Her platelet count increased to 92 000/microL on the day of discharge and she was prescribed a tapered dose of oral prednisone. One day later, her rash had resolved and her platelet count was 243 000/microL. The patient recovered completely with no complications. CONCLUSIONS ITP should be considered a severe AE of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Knowing the early signs and symptoms of ITP will become increasingly important as more of the population receives this vaccine. Quick diagnosis and management are essential to avoid life-threatening bleeding.	Case Report
34219971	A photo-electrochemical aptasensor for the determination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 receptor-binding domain by using graphitic carbon nitride-cadmium sulfide quantum dots nanocomposite. Herein, a photoelectrochemical aptasensor for the quantitive measurement of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 receptor-binding domain (Sars-Cov-2 RBD) has been reported for the first time. For this purpose, first, graphitic carbon nitride and (gC3N4) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) quantum dots were fabricated and characterized. After that, gC3N4 and CdS were mixed well. The fabricated nanomaterials were characterized by scanning transmission electron microscopy. Then, the CdS QDs-gC3N4 nanocomposite was added to the solution containing chitosan as an amine-rich polymer to generate a Chitosan/CdS-gC3N4 nanocomposite. Subsequently, the surface of the ITO electrode was modified with Chitosan/CdS-gC3N4. After that, the amine-terminal aptamer probes were immobilized on the surface of the Chitosan/CdS QDs-gC3N4/ITO electrode by using glutaraldehyde as an amine-amine crosslinker. The electrochemical performances of the electrodes were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and photo-electrochemistry (PEC). The surface coverage of the immobilized aptamer probe was founded to be 26.2 pmol.cm(-2). The obtained results demonstrated that the proposed photo-electrochemical aptasensor can be used for the measurement of Sars-Cov-2 RBD within 0.5-32.0 nM. The limit of detection (LOD) was obtained to be 0.12 nM (at 3sigma/slope). The affinity of the Aptamer/Chitosan/CdS QDs-gC3N4/ITO was also founded to be 3.4 nM by using Langmuir-typical adsorption systems. The proposed photo-electrochemical aptasensor was applied for the measurement of the spiked Sars-Cov-2 RBD in human saliva samples at two concentrations. The effect of the interfering biomaterials such as human immunoglobulin G human immunoglobulin A, human immunoglobulin M, and human serum albumin was also studied.	Diagnosis

34211468	From Plant Survival Under Severe Stress to Anti-Viral Human Defense - A Perspective That Calls for Common Efforts. Reprogramming of primary virus-infected cells is the critical step that turns viral attacks harmful to humans by initiating super-spreading at cell, organism and population levels. To develop early anti-viral therapies and proactive administration, it is important to understand the very first steps of this process. Plant somatic embryogenesis (SE) is the earliest and most studied model for de novo programming upon severe stress that, in contrast to virus attacks, promotes individual cell and organism survival. We argued that transcript level profiles of target genes established from in vitro SE induction as reference compared to virus-induced profiles can identify differential virus traits that link to harmful reprogramming. To validate this hypothesis, we selected a standard set of genes named 'ReprogVirus'. This approach was recently applied and published. It resulted in identifying 'CoV-MAC-TED', a complex trait that is promising to support combating SARS-CoV-2-induced cell reprogramming in primary infected nose and mouth cells. In this perspective, we aim to explain the rationale of our scientific approach. We are highlighting relevant background knowledge on SE, emphasize the role of alternative oxidase in plant reprogramming and resilience as a learning tool for designing human virus-defense strategies and, present the list of selected genes. As an outlook, we announce wider data collection in a 'ReprogVirus Platform' to support anti-viral strategy design through common efforts.	Mechanism;Treatment
34199900	Using Bus Ticketing Big Data to Investigate the Behaviors of the Population Flow of Chinese Suburban Residents in the Post-COVID-19 Phase. Large-scale population movements can turn local diseases into widespread epidemics. Grasping the characteristic of the population flow in the context of the COVID-19 is of great significance for providing information to epidemiology and formulating scientific and reasonable prevention and control policies. Especially in the post-COVID-19 phase, it is essential to maintain the achievement of the fight against the epidemic. Previous research focuses on flight and railway passenger travel behavior and patterns, but China also has numerous suburban residents with a not-high economic level; investigating their travel behaviors is significant for national stability. However, estimating the impacts of the COVID-19 for suburban residents' travel behaviors remains challenging because of lacking apposite data. Here we submit bus ticketing data including approximately 26,000,000 records from April 2020-August 2020 for 2705 stations. Our results indicate that Suburban residents in Chinese Southern regions are more likely to travel by bus, and travel frequency is higher. Associated with the economic level, we find that residents in the economically developed region more likely to travel or carry out various social activities. Considering from the perspective of the traveling crowd, we find that men and young people are easier to travel by bus; however, they are exactly the main workforce. The indication of our findings is that suburban residents' travel behavior is affected profoundly by economy and consistent with the inherent behavior patterns before the COVID-19 outbreak. We use typical regions as verification and it is indeed the case.	Prevention
34220705	Could Exogenous Insulin Ameliorate the Metabolic Dysfunction Induced by Glucocorticoids and COVID-19? The finding that high-dose dexamethasone improves survival in those requiring critical care due to COVID-19 will mean much greater usage of glucocorticoids in the subsequent waves of coronavirus infection. Furthermore, the consistent finding of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 in individuals with obesity, hypertension and diabetes has focussed attention on the metabolic dysfunction that may arise with critical illness. The SARS coronavirus itself may promote relative insulin deficiency, ketogenesis and hyperglycaemia in susceptible individuals. In conjunction with prolonged critical care, these components will promote a catabolic state. Insulin infusion is the mainstay of therapy for treatment of hyperglycaemia in acute illness but what is the effect of insulin on the admixture of glucocorticoids and COVID-19? This article reviews the evidence for the effect of insulin on clinical outcomes and intermediary metabolism in critical illness.	Treatment
34362224	SARS-CoV-2 and the Brain: What Do We Know about the Causality of 'Cognitive COVID? The second year of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) pandemic has seen the need to identify and assess the long-term consequences of a SARS-CoV-2 infection on an individual's overall wellbeing, including adequate cognitive functioning. 'Cognitive COVID' is an informal term coined to interchangeably refer to acute changes in cognition during COVID-19 and/or cognitive sequelae with various deficits following the infection. These may manifest as altered levels of consciousness, encephalopathy-like symptoms, delirium, and loss of various memory domains. Dysexecutive syndrome is a peculiar manifestation of 'Cognitive COVID' as well. In the previous major outbreaks of viruses like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and Influenza. There have been attempts to understand the underlying mechanisms describing the causality of similar symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review, therefore, is attempting to highlight the current understanding of the various direct and indirect mechanisms, focusing on the role of neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, the general pro-inflammatory state, and the pandemic-associated psychosocial stressors in the causality of 'Cognitive COVID.' Neurotropism is associated with various mechanisms including retrograde neuronal transmission via olfactory pathway, a general hematogenous spread, and the virus using immune cells as vectors. The high amounts of inflammation caused by COVID-19, compounded with potential intubation, are associated with a deleterious effect on the cognition as well. Finally, the pandemic's unique psychosocial impact has raised alarm due to its possible effect on cognition. Furthermore, with surfacing reports of post-COVID-vaccination cognitive impairments after vaccines containing mRNA encoding for spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize their causality and ways to mitigate the risk. The potential impact on the quality of life of an individual and the fact that even a minor proportion of COVID-19 cases developing cognitive impairment could be a significant burden on already overwhelmed healthcare systems across the world make it vital to gather further evidence regarding the prevalence, presentation, correlations, and causality of these events and reevaluate our approach to accommodate early identification, management, and rehabilitation of patients exhibiting cognitive symptoms.

Comparing seroprevalence and antibody kinetics in three different commercially available assays for SARS-CoV-2. Serostatus of COVID-19 patients was analyzed 5 months and 10 months after their infection, using three different assays: Diasorin LIAISON, Euroimmun, Abbott Diagnostics ARCHITECT. Seropositivity at baseline differed significantly depending on the assay (Diasorin 81%, Euroimmun 83%, Abbott 59%). At follow-up antibody levels detected in the Diasorin assay were stable, while there was a significant loss in seropositivity in the Euroimmun and Abbott assays. There are significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 antibody kinetics based on the specific assay used.	Diagnosis
34214608	Radiotherapy based management during Covid-19 pandemic - A systematic review of presented consensus and guidelines. Treatment management of cancer patients in the radiation oncology departments during the current COVID-19 pandemic is challenging. A systematic review of published consensus/guidelines on the role of radiotherapy prioritization, suggested treatment protocols, and set up management was undertaken based on the PRISMA protocol and through PubMed/PMC, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science databases until 01/20/2021. One hundred and sixty-eight publications or regional consensus were included. Summary of recommendations contained: (1) using hypo-fractionated (Hypo-F) regimens for therapeutic/palliative indications, (2) delaying radiotherapy for several weeks or until pandemic over, (3) omitting radiotherapy by replacement of alternative therapies or active surveillance, (4) applying safer patients' setup and preparation protocols, (5) developing telemedicine/telehealth service. To conclude, it is essential to carefully weigh the risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection and the benefit of treating cancer patients during the pandemic. Trying to have a global guideline facing this or any other probable crisis is crucial for health care service.	Prevention
34225188	Increased incidence of post-operative respiratory failure in patients with pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE: While studies have reported increased post-operative pulmonary complications with SARS-CoV-2 infection, many are limited by use of historical controls or focus on less severe respiratory complications. We characterized the association between pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 infection and post-operative respiratory failure (PORF). DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a single center retrospective cohort study in New York City between March 14-June 14, 2020. PATIENTS: Exclusion criteria were age < 18-years, obstetric procedures, absence of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and pre-operative respiratory failure. A total of 778 patients met criteria, of which 87 had SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome, PORF, included inability to extubate for >/=24 h or unplanned re-intubation within 5 days. Multiple exposures were measured including SARS-CoV-2 infection 4 weeks before or 5 days after surgery. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for pre-operative hypoxemia, oxygen use, and pneumonia as well as tachycardia, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Surgical Mortality Probability Model (S-MPM) index, and peri-operative blood transfusion. MAIN RESULTS: SARS-CoV patients had higher CCI (P = 0.007) and S-MPM scores (P = 0.02). The incidence of PORF was 16% versus 7% in uninfected comparators (P = 0.001). Amongst infected individuals, 39% exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 and PORF was more common in these patients compared to asymptomatic individuals (26% vs. 9%, P = 0.04). Adjusted analysis revealed increased odds of PORF with infection (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2-6.2). This persisted even when adjusting for probable mediators such as pre-operative hypoxemia. Infected patients also demonstrated increased adjusted odds of 30-day mortality (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.4-9.1). CONCLUSIONS: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 4 weeks before or 5 days after surgery is associated with increased odds of 5-day PORF and 30-day mortality. This supports delaying elective surgery, but questions remain regarding the applicability of this recommendation for asymptomatic patients needing urgent or semi-urgent procedures such as oncologic surgery.

34211708	Rapid decline of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients on haemodialysis: the COVID-FRIAT study. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients on haemodialysis (HD) have high mortality. We investigated the value of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the dynamic changes of antibodies (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoglobulin M (IgM) + IgA and/or IgG) in a large HD cohort. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study in 10 Madrid HD centres. Infection rate, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics and the incidence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined by positive RT-PCR, IgM + IgA and/or IgG) were assessed. Results: From 1 March to 15 April 2020, 136 of 808 (16.8%) HD patients were diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs and 42/136 (31%) died. In the second fortnight of April, RT-PCR and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were assessed in 763 of the surviving patients. At this point, 69/91 (75.8%) symptomatic COVID-19 patients had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Four weeks later, 15.4% (10/65) of initially antibody-positive patients had become negative. Among patients without prior symptomatic COVID-19, 9/672 (1.3%) were RT-PCR positive and 101/672 patients (15.0%) were antibody positive. Four weeks later, 62/86 (72.1%) of initially antibody-positive patients had become negative. Considering only IgG titres, serology remained positive after 4 weeks in 90% (54/60) of patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and in 52.5% (21/40) of asymptomatic patients. The probability of an adequate serologic response (defined as the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that persisted at 4 weeks) was higher in patients who had symptomatic COVID-19 than in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection {odds ratio [OR) 4.04 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.04-7.99]} corrected for age, Charlson comorbidity index score and time on HD. Living in a nursing home [OR 5.9 (95% CI 2.3-15.1)] was the main risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody immune response in HD patients depends on clinical presentation. The antibody titres decay earlier than previously reported for the general population. This inadequate immune response raises questions about the efficacy of future vaccines.	Diagnosis
34287515	Latin American ophthalmology practitioner's perception on current COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: To assess the perception of Latin American ophthalmology practitioners regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure risk, knowledge about personal protection measures, and prioritization of patients. METHODS: Self-administered voluntary anonymous survey (Google Drive forms) was distributed via text message to ophthalmology practitioners from May 01 to May 05, 2020. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-one practitioners (45% response rate) comprising 118 (27.6%) residents, 111 (40.5%) ophthalmologists, and 142 (32.8%) sub-specialists completed the survey. Among them, 106 (32.6%) thought that they were at a high risk of acquiring COVID-19 during the course of work. Furthermore, 273 (69.1%) believed that the current guidelines were insufficient to identify COVID-19 patients. The survey also revealed that 265 (59.5%) were not trained to use personal protective equipment (PPE), and even with its correct use, 341 (91.5%) still felt that they were at risk of acquiring COVID-19. Moreover, 80% of the respondents were of the view that staff members were not knowledgeable about national protocols for attending COVID-19 patients. However, only 9 (2%) considered changing their profession to ameliorate COVID-19 contagion risk. CONCLUSION: This survey has revealed the issues faced by ophthalmology practitioners in Latin America during their routine practice. These concerns and anxiety about COVID- 19 pandemic seem to be the same worldwide. It is important to reinforce the confidence of ophthalmology practitioners on current guidelines for attending COVID-19 patients. It is also necessary to conduct training programs on PPE usage and ensure that PPE items are available at all times to enhance the quality of care and minimize the spread of the disease.	Prevention
34201868	Understanding COVID-19 Epidemiology and Implications for Control: The Experience from a Greek Semi-Closed Community. BACKGROUND: We aimed to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody seroprevalence in one of the worst-affected by the pandemic semi-closed communities in Greece, Deskati, and evaluate the sociodemographic and clinical correlations of functional antibody responses. METHODS: The Ag2019n-CoV V1310/V1330 Rapid Test (Prognosis Biotech, Greece) was used for antigen detection. The Rapid Test 2019-nCoV Total Ig, V1210/V1230 (Prognosis Biotech, Greece), and the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant method (Architect, Abbott, Illinois, USA) were used for antibody testing. RESULTS: None of the participants had a positive antigen result. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity ranged from 13% to 45% in the study population, depending on the method. One-third of the participants with known past infection had a positive antibody test result 77 +/- 13 days after infection. Two-fifths of infections determined by serology were asymptomatic. The advancing age and hospitalization predicted seropositivity among patients with past infection. Half of the participants who tested positive for antibodies were not aware of past infection. CONCLUSIONS: High-burden contexts in Greece, such as Deskati, are not so far from herd immunity thresholds. We highlighted the value of low-cost serosurveys targeting both symptomatic and asymptomatic populations to evaluate the natural immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in nonvaccinated susceptibles and design evidence-based policies for lifting lockdowns.

34291027	Role of Threat and Coping Appraisal in Protection Motivation for Adoption of Preventive Behavior During COVID-19 Pandemic. With more than 100 million cases and over 2 million deaths globally, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to remain a major threat. Identifying the behavioral factors influencing preventive behaviors for COVID-19 are crucial in devising public health policies to promote essential strategies to combat the pandemic in an efficient manner. The current study was therefore conducted to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 preventive behaviors and measure their association with behavioral constructs like threat perception, response efficacy, and self-efficacy, as per socio-demographic background. A region-stratified online survey focusing on the constructs of protection motivation theory, for example, threat and coping appraisal for preventive health practices against COVID-19, was carried out among adult users of social media in India. Generalized linear models with cluster-adjusted-robust standard errors were used to analyze the responses and model the preventive practices among the study population. Analysis of a total 2,646 responses revealed that proper perceptions regarding cause, symptoms, and transmission of COVID-19 were prevalent in the majority of the respondents. The majority of the participants reported frequent use of face masks (93.20%), followed by frequent washing of hands with soap and water (84.90%). The majority of the respondents affirmed that, though not frequently but sometimes, they avoid touching the face with unclean hands. Frequently covering mouth with the crook of the elbow while sneezing and coughing, and maintaining physical distance when outside was noted among 74.14 and 83.84%, respectively. The proportion of participants frequently using sanitizers to clean hands and those infrequently practicing the same were comparable. Self-efficacy for preventive practices and threat-appraisal of COVID-19 illness were identified as important determinants of the selected COVID-19 preventive behaviors, independently. The analysis confirmed that practices of the behaviors were mostly synergistic to each other. Current findings highlight that formulation of precise risk communication strategies to improve perceptions regarding threat appraisal and self-efficacy could facilitate desirable practices, which are also effective in the prevention of airborne infections and, hence, may contribute toward broader policy directions. The evidence urges the implementation of precision-driven risk communication and diffusion of these practices to attain behavioral herd immunity.	Prevention
34281002	COVID-19 and the Impact on the Cranio-Oro-Facial Trauma Care in Italy: An Epidemiological Retrospective Cohort Study. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has deeply modified the organization of hospitals, health care centers, and the patient's behavior. The aim of this epidemiological retrospective cohort study is to evaluate if and how the COVID-19 pandemic has determined a modification in cranio-oro-facial traumatology service. METHODS: The dataset included hospital emergency room access of a six-month pre-pandemic period and six months into pandemic outbreak. The variables collected were: patient age, gender, type of emergency access with relative color code, Glasgow Coma Scale Score, type of discharge. RESULTS: 537 vs. 237 (pre-pandemic vs. pandemic) patients accessed the hospital emergency room and the mean age decreased from 60.79 +/- 25.34 to 56.75 +/- 24.50 year. Yellow and green code access went from 28.9% and 66.1% to 37.5% and 57.7% (pre-pandemic vs. pandemic). Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) shows an increase of 16.6% vs. 27.8% of 15 grade score, a 28.7% vs. 28.5% of the 14 grade score and reduction of 13 and 12 grade 40.2% and 14.5% vs. 37.1 and 9.7% (pre-pandemic vs. pandemic). CONCLUSIONS: Since the COVID-19 outbreak continues, epidemiological data are still necessary to perform public health intervention strategies and to appropriately predict the population needs, in order to properly manage the COVID-19 related to oral pathologies as well as the most common health problems.

34353275	The insights of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Current understanding, research and therapeutic updates. BACKGROUND: Humans can be infected with various coronaviruses that cause serious illness and death. One such pandemic strain of coronavirus was recently identified in December 2019 and lead to a devastating outbreak in Wuhan city of China. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is highly contagious which causes symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to highlight the current understanding, research and therapeutic updates of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A thorough literature search was conducted for research papers and patents in context to COVID-19. All articles with respect to this subject was taken from various public repositories such as Google Scholar, Pubmed, ScienceDirect (Elsevier), Springer, Web of Science, etc. Results: The present analysis showed that key areas of the inventions were the vaccines and diagnostic kits apart from the composition for the treatment of CoV. It was also observed that no specific vaccine treatments are available for the treatment of 2019-nCov; however, developing novel chemical or biological drugs and kits for early diagnosis, prevention, and disease management is the primary governing topic among the patented inventions. The present study also indicates potential research opportunities for the future, particularly to combat 2019-nCoV. The current focus of the researches has turned towards developing four potential treatments including development of candidate vaccine, development of novel potential drugs, repurposing of existing drugs and development of convalescent plasma therapy. The PCR based diagnosis is the gold standard for the COVID-19 testing but it require resource time, expertise and high associated cost hence the researchers are also developing different diagnosis methods for the COVID-19. Although vaccines are being developed by various companies and have passed the pre-clinical stages but still there exists no guarantee for these to become the effective vaccine. The current treatments which are being used for COVID-19 patients are not well established and have limited success. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has challenged the medical, economic and public health infrastructure across globe. There is urgent need to explore all available and possible methods/approaches to study this disease for drug and vaccine development at the earliest.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34353699	Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are associated with poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the sole causative agent of coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19). METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective single-center study of consecutively admitted patients between March 1st and May 15th(,) 2020, with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary end-point was to evaluate the association of lipid markers with 30-days all-cause mortality in COVID-19. A total of 654 patients were enrolled, with an estimated 30-day mortality of 22.8% (149 patients). Non-survivors had lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during the entire course of the disease. Both showed a significant inverse correlation with inflammatory markers and a positive correlation with lymphocyte count. In a multivariate analysis, LDL-c </= 69 mg/dl (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.31), C-reactive protein >88 mg/dl (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41-4.23) and lymphopenia <1000 (HR 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91-3.78) at admission were independently associated with 30-day mortality. This association was maintained 7 days after admission. Survivors presented with complete normalization of their lipid profiles on short-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: Hypolipidemia in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be secondary to an immune-inflammatory response, with complete recovery in survivors. Low LDL-c serum levels are independently associated with higher 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34226805	Repurposing Siddha mercurial drug for mild to moderate COVID-19 - Case series and exploration of its chemical profile. Background: Vajra kandi maathirai (VKM) is a mercury based traditional Siddha drug used to treat various types of fevers and inflammatory diseases. We report our experience of using VKM successfully to treat 5 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients and its chemical profile. Case report: A family with 5 members age ranges between 13 to 77, both male and females, one with preexisting renal impairment, SARS CoV-2 positive with mild to moderate category were treated with VKM along with the specific dietary practice. The drug was consumed at home quarantine. Real-Time RT PCR from oropharynx swab, X-ray/CT scan chest, hematology, renal function, liver function, body temperature and oxygen saturation were assessed. Blood parameters were repeated after completion of therapy to assess the safety aspect of mercury drug. Chemical profile of the drug was done using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results: With the first dose, the oxygen saturation was improved. Within 3 days of therapy, all symptoms (fever, body pain, cough, and loss of taste) were normalized and renders the Real-Time RT PCR negative for COVID-19. There was no observed side effects and damage to renal and liver. The drug contains 22% of mercury along with a 9-Octadecenoic acid-(E), 1H-Imidazole, 4,5-dihydro-2-(phenylmethyl) and 9,12-Octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)- as major organic compounds. Conclusion: Vajra kandi maathirai might be a safe drug to manage COVID-19 patients. Rigorous research is required to discover new antiviral molecules from this formulation.	Case Report
34289741	Detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of COVID-19. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection is a critical element of the public health response to COVID-19. Point-of-care (POC) tests can drive patient management decisions for infectious diseases, including COVID-19. POC tests are available for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and include those that detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens as well as amplified RNA sequences. We provide a review of SARS-CoV-2 POC tests including their performance, settings for which they might be used, their impact and future directions. Further optimization and validation, new technologies as well as studies to determine clinical and epidemiological impact of SARS-CoV-2 POC tests are needed.	Diagnosis
34203388	Study on the Development of Antiviral Spandex Fabric Coated with Poly(hexamethylene biguanide) Hydrochloride (PHMB). The spread of COVID-19 has brought about huge losses around the world. This study aims to investigate the applicability of PHMB used for developing antiviral spandex clothing against coronavirus. PHMB was qualitatively determined on the surface of spandex fabrics by using BPB. The antiviral analysis shows that the PHMB-treated spandex fabric can kill 99% of the coronavirus within 2 h of contact, which suggests that the spandex fabric treated with PHMB could be used for developing antiviral clothing against coronaviruses for containing the transmission of COVID-19 in high-risk places. Furthermore, PHMB-treated spandex fabrics were shown excellent antibacterial activity against gram-positive S. aureus and gram-negative K. pneumoniae. The hand feel properties of Spandex fabric were not significantly affected by the PHMB coating in addition to the wrinkle recovery, which was obviously improved after PHMB coating.	Prevention
34339864	Advances in the computational landscape for repurposed drugs against COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused millions of deaths and massive societal distress worldwide. Therapeutic solutions are urgently needed but de novo drug development remains a lengthy process. One promising alternative is computational drug repurposing, which enables the prioritization of existing compounds through fast in silico analyses. Recent efforts based on molecular docking, machine learning, and network analysis have produced actionable predictions. Some predicted drugs, targeting viral proteins and pathological host pathways are undergoing clinical trials. Here, we review this work, highlight drugs with high predicted efficacy and classify their mechanisms of action. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the published methodologies and outline possible future directions. Finally, we curate a list of COVID-19 data portals and other repositories that could be used to accelerate future research.	Treatment
34284812	Severe reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in a nursing home resident: a case report. BACKGROUND: The topic of natural immunity related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 remains controversial. Although evidence suggests postinfection immunity can be achieved, there have been reported cases of reinfection with similar or milder symptoms. Information on severe disease manifestation during reinfection is not known. We present a case of reinfection with a more severe presentation as compared with the initial infection. CASE REPORT: We describe a white male patient from a nursing home who was reinfected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with severe disease manifesting as dyspnea, fevers, and encephalopathy with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation, elevated inflammatory markers, and lung infiltrates on imaging, after initially testing positive with mild symptoms 2 months prior to presentation. Notably, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies were detected, which indicated this was a coronavirus disease 2019 reinfection. After treatment with remdesivir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma, he was subsequently extubated and discharged home after 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: It is not clear whether an initial infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and recovery provides prolonged immunity beyond 2 months. Furthermore, even if antibodies are present, it does not guarantee an attenuated course during reinfection. Therefore, vaccination plays an important role in prevention. Long-term cohort studies will be needed to study the factors behind reinfection.	Case Report
34349402	Coronavirus disease 2019 and its vaccines: An update. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus. Most of the people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild-to-moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems are more likely to develop serious illness. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 emerged in the city of Wuhan, China, and caused an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia. Being highly transmissible, this novel coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19, has spread fast all over the world. It has overwhelmingly surpassed SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome in terms of both the number of infected people and the epidemic areas. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation. Infections caused by these viruses are an enormous global health threat. Hence, the government has established fast-tracking research to develop rapid diagnostic test kits and vaccines at low cost. This review highlights the vaccines available against COVID 19 worldwide and its implications.	Treatment
34203306	Telemedicine in the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from the First Survey among Italian Pediatric Diabetes Centers. BACKGROUND: Use of telemedicine for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic was investigated. METHOD: 68 Italian pediatric diabetes centers were invited to complete a survey about telemedicine usage in their pediatric patients, allocated to the no-tech group (multiple daily injections and self-monitoring blood glucose) and the tech group (insulin pump and/or flash- or continuous-glucose monitoring). RESULTS: 60.3% of the centers completed the survey. In both the no-tech and tech groups, the most used ways of communication were generic download portals, instant messaging with personal physicians' mobiles, working emails, and phone calls to physicians' mobiles, with no difference, except for the use of email being higher in the no-tech group (p = 0.03). Seventy-four percent of the centers did not have any systematization and/or reimbursement, with significant differences among regions (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Almost all Italian pediatric diabetes centers use telemedicine in a semi-volunteering manner, lacking proper codification, reimbursement system, legal traceability, and accreditation system.

34281792	Assessment of potential risk factors for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) among health care workers. BACKGROUND: Understanding COVID-19 infection among health workers and the risk factors for adverse outcomes is important not only for characterizing virus transmission patterns and risk factors for infection, but also for preventing the future infection of health workers and other patients and reducing secondary COVID-19 transmission within health care settings. Our aim was to identify risk factors for infection among health care workers to limit adverse events in health care facilities. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 336 HCWs from COVID-19 treatment hospitals took part in the study with varying COVID-19 exposure risk depending on job function and working site. All participants were asked about risk factors for COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Among our participants, 42.6% were medical doctors, 28.6% nurses and 7.4% assistant nurses and 21.4% were others. Forty four percent of participants had work experience 5-10 years. More than half of participants received training in Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) (56.8%) about COVID 19; 91% have hand hygiene facilities and 69% admitted availability of PPE. More than half of participants admitted that they always follow IPC measures. Two thirds of participants (66.7%) had close contact with a patient since admission; 42.3% were present in aerosolizing procedures for patients. Forty two percent of participants had respiratory symptom; the most common was sore throat representing (32.4%). The highest frequency of respiratory symptoms was among of nurses and assistant nurses 51%. Frequency of respiratory symptoms was higher among those who contacted the patient directly or for prolonged period compared to those who do not admitted these contacts. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for COVID-19 represented by those who were smokers, nurses and assistant nurses were more liable to catch COVID-19 than doctors as they contacted the patient directly for prolonged period or his/her body fluids, materials or surfaces around him.

34285711	Exploring the Mystery of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme II (ACE2) in the Battle against SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 is the newly born pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the recently emerged betacoronavirus that crosses the species barrier. It predominantly infects pneumocytes of the respiratory tract, but due to the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) on other cells like surface enterocytes of the upper esophagus and colon, these are also considered as the primary sites of infection. ACE2 receptor served as a cellular entry point for SARS-CoV-2. The expression of the ACE2 receptors is regulated by several factors such as age, tobacco smoking, inflammatory signaling, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and comorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis, cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes). Therefore, scientists are trying to explore the in-depth knowledge of ACE2 and considered it as a potential indirect target for COVID-19 therapeutics. In this focused review, we discussed in detail ACE2 expressions and regulation by different factors in the primary or vulnerable sites of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Clinical trials of rhACE2 in COVID-19 patients are ongoing, and if the outcome of the trials proves positive, it will be a breakthrough for the management of COVID-19. Finally, we suggest that targeting the ACE2 (a master regulator) in a balanced way could serve as a potential option against the management of COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34291856	Molecular evidence suggesting the persistence of residual SARS-CoV-2 and immune responses in the placentas of pregnant patients recovered from COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the tissues of clinically recovered patients and persistent immune symptoms in discharged patients for up to several months. Pregnant patients were shown to be a high-risk group for COVID-19. Based on these findings, we assessed SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and protein retention in the placentas of pregnant women who had fully recovered from COVID-19 and cytokine fluctuations in maternal and foetal tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Remnant SARS-CoV-2 in the term placenta was detected using nucleic acid amplification and immunohistochemical staining of the SARS-CoV-2 protein. The infiltration of CD14+ macrophages into the placental villi was detected by immunostaining. The cytokines in the placenta, maternal plasma, neonatal umbilical cord, cord blood and amniotic fluid specimens at delivery were profiled using the Luminex assay. RESULTS: Residual SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and protein were detected in the term placentas of recovered pregnant women. The infiltration of CD14+ macrophages into the placental villi of the recovered pregnant women was higher than that in the controls. Furthermore, the cytokine levels in the placenta, maternal plasma, neonatal umbilical cord, cord blood and amniotic fluid specimens fluctuated significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (in one patient) and protein (in five patients) were present in the placentas of clinically recovered pregnant patients for more than 3 months after diagnosis. The immune responses induced by the virus may lead to prolonged and persistent symptoms in the maternal plasma, placenta, umbilical cord, cord blood and amniotic fluid.	Diagnosis;Treatment;Mechanism
34222738	Wastewater Sample Site Selection to Estimate Geographically Resolved Community Prevalence of COVID-19: A Sampling Protocol Perspective. Wastewater monitoring for virus infections within communities can complement conventional clinical surveillance. Currently, most SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) clinical testing is voluntary and inconsistently available, except for a few occupational and educational settings, and therefore likely underrepresents actual population prevalence. Randomized testing on a regular basis to estimate accurate population-level infection rates is prohibitively costly and is hampered by a range of limitations and barriers associated with participation in clinical research. In comparison, community-level fecal monitoring can be performed through wastewater surveillance to effectively surveil communities. However, epidemiologically defined protocols for wastewater sample site selection are lacking. Herein, we describe methods for developing a geographically resolved population-level wastewater sampling approach in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and present preliminary results. Utilizing this site selection protocol, samples (n = 237) were collected from 17 wastewater catchment areas, September 8 to October 30, 2020 from one to four times per week in each area and compared to concurrent clinical data aggregated to wastewater catchment areas and county level. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was consistently present in wastewater during the studied period, and varied by area. Data obtained using the site selection protocol showed variation in geographically resolved wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration compared to clinical rates. These findings highlight the importance of neighborhood-equivalent spatial scales and provide a promising approach for viral epidemic surveillance, thus better guiding spatially targeted public health mitigation strategies.

34218545	A new application of mTOR inhibitor drugs as potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19. Since December 2019, the COVID-19 emerging pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in one of the most important global health threats. Concerning the absence of an approved effective vaccine or drug for the treatment and outcome improvement of COVID-19 patients, and the role of SARS-CoV-2 in activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, we decided to review the previous data regarding the therapeutic effect of mTOR inhibitor drugs in COVID-19 patients. We searched the scientific databases such as Web of Science, Embase, Medline (PubMed), Scopus, and Google Scholar using appropriate keywords to find suitable studies or suggestions until October 2020. The findings of the current study confirmed that mTOR inhibitor drugs through suggested mechanisms such as T cell adjustment, induction of autophagy without apoptosis, reduction of viral replication, restoration of the T-cell function, decrease cytokine storm, and moderation of the mTOR-PI3K-AKT pathway activation bring about a therapeutic impact in COVID-19 patients. Taken together, it is necessary to find a suitable therapy for the COVID-19 pandemic emerging. In this regard, we clarify that it is valuable to consider the therapeutic effect of mTOR inhibitor drugs and metformin by its mTOR inhibition property in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

34207024	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Crisis: Losing Our Immunity When We Need It the Most. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has led to a new socioeconomic reality with the acquisition of novel habits. Measures imposed by governments and health authorities such as confinement and lockdown have had important consequences, including mental health problems, economic crisis, and social isolation. Combined with newly acquired habits such as hand washing, sanitization, and face masks, these have all directly and indirectly led to reduced immunity. Such effects on the immune system not only impact the epidemiological profile with respect to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases but also limit the efficacy of the ongoing anti-COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Therefore, there is a need to review these approaches and optimize measures towards better population immunity, which is much needed during such an epidemic.	Prevention
34281995	Telemammography for breast cancer screening: a cost-effective approach in Argentina. OBJECTIVES: Argentina is a low and middle-income country (LMIC) with a highly fragmented healthcare system that conflicts with access to healthcare stated by the country's Universal Health Coverage plan. A tele-mammography network could improve access to breast cancer screening decreasing its mortality. This research aims to conduct an economic evaluation of the implementation of a tele-mammography program to improve access to healthcare. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed to explore the incremental benefit of annual tele-mammography screening for at-risk Argentinian women over 40 years old. A Markov model was developed to simulate annual mammography or tele-mammography screening in two hypothetical population-based cohorts of asymptomatic women. Parameter uncertainty was evaluated through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Model structure uncertainty was also explored to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: It was estimated that 31 out of 100 new cases of breast cancer would be detected by mammography and 39/100 by tele-mammography. The model returned an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound26 051/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) which is lower than the WHO-recommended threshold of pound26 288/QALY for Argentina. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed the ICER is most sensitive to the uptake and sensitivity of the screening tests. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed tele-mammography is cost-effective in 59% of simulations. DISCUSSION: Tele-mammography should be considered for adoption as it could improve access to expertise in underserved areas where adherence to screening protocols is poor. Disaggregated data by province is needed for a better- informed policy decision. Telemedicine could also be beneficial in ensuring the continuity of care when health systems are under stress like in the current COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: There is a 59% chance that tele-mammography is cost-effective compared to mammography for at-risk Argentinian women over 40- years old, and should be adopted to improve access to healthcare in underserved areas of the country.

34209504	"Kidney Transplantation in COVID Pandemic-A Review of Guidelines. The paper describes problems with the transplantation process during the COVID-19 pandemic. Transplantation procedures and programs have been impacted by COVID-19. The number of transplants has fallen noticeably. The first part of the paper points out changes in service organization, in particular donor and recipient pre-transplant and peri-transplant management. If the patients during pre-transplant evaluation need to attend face-to-face appointments, such as blood testing or other investigations, the risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19 should be minimized. ""Clear green areas"", which are COVID-19-free pathways, are highly recommended in hospitals during transplant procedures. Diagnostic procedures concerning donors, including CT scans and coronavirus testing (nasopharyngeal swab), are necessary before transplant surgery. COVID-19 symptoms and risks of the transplant population are described. Detailed guidelines from transplant societies concerning changes in immunosuppression in infected recipients are discussed. Management of infected or suspected medical staff is mentioned. The paper ends with guidelines concerning vaccination against COVID-19 in transplant recipients."	Prevention;Treatment
34284733	COVID-19 social distancing: negative effects on people with Parkinson disease and their associations with confidence for self-management. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to describe the effects of COVID-19 social distancing on the function, health, and well-being of people with Parkinson disease (PD), and test the association of these effects with patients' activation levels, i.e., their skills and confidence in managing their health. METHODS: Community-dwelling individuals with PD answered an anonymous web-based survey. Part 1 included 27 multiple-choice questions regarding changes in function, health, medical care, and well-being. Part 2 consisted of the Patient Activation Measure, which enquired about skills and confidence in managing one's health. RESULTS: Respondents (N = 142) reported decreases in various function (24.8%-37.3%), health (33.8%-43%), and well-being (26.1%-47.1%) domains. Rehabilitation ceased for 61.2%. Among those reporting a worsening of health, 67.8% associated this with the cessation of rehabilitative treatments or decrease in physical activity. Patients' activation levels were inversely correlated with increased assistance for activities of daily living, increased tiredness, worsening symptoms, and lack of support from family and friends. CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing had a major negative impact on the health and function of people with PD. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Supporting people with PD skills and confidence in managing health may preserve their physical and mental health during this period of dramatic changes in life's circumstances.

A specific aptameric sequence has been immobilized on short polyethyleneglycol (PEG) interface on gold nano-film deposited on a D-shaped plastic optical fiber (POFs) probe, and the protein binding has been monitored exploiting the very sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has been specifically used to develop an aptasensor. Surface analysis techniques coupled to fluorescence microscopy and plasmonic analysis have been utilized to characterize the biointerface. Spanning a wide protein range (25 / 1000 nM), the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein was detected with a Limit of Detection (LoD) of about 37 nM. Different interferents (BSA, AH1N1 hemagglutinin protein and MERS spike protein) have been tested confirming the specificity of our aptasensor. Finally, a preliminary test in diluted human serum encouraged its application in a point-of-care device, since POF-based aptasensor represent a potentially low-cost compact biosensor, characterized by a rapid response, a small size and could be an ideal laboratory portable diagnostic tool.

34281582	COVID-19 in Ghana: challenges and countermeasures for maternal health service delivery in public health facilities. We provide a situational update on COVID-19 in Ghana, the seventh African country reporting the most cases. Some modifications occurring within the health system to curtail the outbreak and its potential impact on the delivery of antenatal care services are also highlighted. With the discovery of the Delta variant in Ghana, the current attention is to prevent a third wave of infection, and also control and manage existing cases. Efforts to procure vaccines, vaccinate special populations and sensitize the public on the implications of vaccine hesitancy are ongoing. Amidst these activities, we suggest some innovations and countermeasures to safeguard primary healthcare services and potentially reinvest efforts towards achieving the sustainable development goal three within the context of maternal healthcare, citing examples specific to developing countries.

34224431	Protein S: function, regulation, and clinical perspectives. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Protein S (PS) is an essential natural anticoagulant. PS deficiency is a major contributor to acquired hypercoagulability. Acquired hypercoagulability causes myocardial infarction, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis in millions of individuals. Yet, despite its importance in hemostasis, PS is the least understood anticoagulant. Even after 40 years since PS was first described, we are still uncovering information about how PS functions. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent findings that advance our understanding of the functions of PS and explain hypercoagulability caused by severe PS deficiency. RECENT FINDINGS: PS has long been described as a cofactor for Activated Protein C (APC) and Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). However, a recent report describes direct inhibition of Factor IXa (FIXa) by PS, an activity of PS that had been completely overlooked. Thrombophilia is becoming a more frequently reported disorder. Hereditary PS deficiency is an anticoagulant deficiency that results eventually in thrombophilia. In addition, PS deficiency is a predisposing factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), but an effect of PS deficiency in arterial thrombosis, such as arterial ischemic stroke, is uncertain. Plasma PS concentration decreases in pregnant women. Inherited thrombophilias are important etiologies for recurrent pregnancy loss, and anticoagulation therapy is of benefit to women with recurrent pregnancy loss who had documented only PS deficiency.Hypoxia is a risk factor for VTE, and hypoxia downregulates plasma PS level. Importantly, COVID-19 can lead to hypoxemia because of lung damage from IL6-driven inflammatory responses to the viral infection. Because hypoxia decreases the abundance of the key anticoagulant PS, we surmise that the IL6-induced cytokine explosion combined with hypoxemia causes a drop in PS level that exacerbates the thrombotic risk in COVID-19 patients. SUMMARY: This review is intended to advance understanding of the anticoagulant function of an important plasma protein, PS. Despite 40+ years of research, we have not had a complete description of PS biology as it pertains to control of blood coagulation. However, the picture of PS function has become sharper with the recent discovery of FIXa inhibition by PS. Hemostasis mediated by PS now includes regulation of FIXa activity alongside the cofactor activities of PS in the TFPI/APC pathways. In addition, the direct inhibition of FIXa by PS suggests that PS, particularly a small derivative of PS, could be used to treat individuals with PS deficiencies or abnormalities that cause thrombotic complications.

34202646	Virus-Negative Necrotizing Coronary Vasculitis with Aneurysm Formation in Human SARS-CoV-2 Infection. We report a case of myopericarditis associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection with necrotizing coronary vasculitis of intramural vessels, giving rise to biventricular apical microaneurysms and to electrical instability. Negativity of myocardial polymerase chain reaction for the most common cardiotropic viruses and for SARS-CoV-2 suggested an immune-mediated myocardial and pericardial inflammatory disease. High dose (1 mg/Kg daily) prednisone and anti-viral (Remdesivir, IDA Business, Carrigtohill, County Cork, T45 DP77, Ireland) therapy led to resolution of cardiac inflammation and ventricular arrhythmias. Morpho-molecular characterization of endomyocardial tissue may improve the outcome in subjects with SARS-CoV-2-associated myopericarditis and coronary vasculitis.	Case Report
34201172	Can Antiviral Activity of Licorice Help Fight COVID-19 Infection? The phytotherapeutic properties of Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice) extract are mainly attributed to glycyrrhizin (GR) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA). Among their possible pharmacological actions, the ability to act against viruses belonging to different families, including SARS coronavirus, is particularly important. With the COVID-19 emergency and the urgent need for compounds to counteract the pandemic, the antiviral properties of GR and GA, as pure substances or as components of licorice extract, attracted attention in the last year and supported the launch of two clinical trials. In silico docking studies reported that GR and GA may directly interact with the key players in viral internalization and replication such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), spike protein, the host transmembrane serine protease 2, and 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease. In vitro data indicated that GR can interfere with virus entry by directly interacting with ACE2 and spike, with a nonspecific effect on cell and viral membranes. Additional anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of GR cannot be excluded. These multiple activities of GR and licorice extract are critically re-assessed in this review, and their possible role against the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and the features of COVID-19 disease is discussed.

34281594	Emergency department impaired adherence to personal protective equipment donning and doffing protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious viral pandemic that has claimed the lives of millions. Personal protective equipment (PPE) may reduce the risk of transmission for health care workers (HCWs), especially in the emergency setting. This study aimed to compare the adherence to PPE donning and doffing protocols in the Emergency Department (ED) vs designated COVID-19 wards and score adherence according to the steps in our protocol. DESIGN: Prior to managing COVID-19 patients, mandatory PPE training was undertaken for all HCWs. HCWs were observed donning or doffing COVID-19 restricted areas. SETTING: Donning and doffing was observed in COVID-19 designated Emergency department and compared to COVID-19 positive wards. PARTICIPANTS: All HCWs working in the aforementioned wards during the time of observation. RESULTS: We observed 107 donning and doffing procedures (30 were observed in the ED). 50% HCWs observed donned PPE correctly and 37% doffed correctly. The ED had a significantly lower mean donning score (ED: 78%, Internal: 95% ICU: 96%, p < 0.001); and a significantly lower mean doffing score (ED: 72%, Internal: 85% ICU: 91%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: As hypothesized, HCWs assigned to the designated ED wing made more protocol deviations compared with HCWs positive COVID-19 wards. Time management, acuity, lack of personnel, stress and known COVID-19 status may explain the lesser adherence to donning and doffing protocols. Further studies to assess the correlation between protocol deviations in use of PPE and morbidity as well as improvement implementations are required. Resources should be invested to ensure PPE is properly used.	Prevention
34341960	Chronic fatigue syndrome: an emerging sequela in COVID-19 survivors? SARS-CoV-2 survivors may report persistent symptoms that resemble myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). We explored (a) ME/CFS-like symptom prevalence and (b) whether axonal, inflammatory, and/or lung changes may contribute to ME/CFS-like symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 survivors through clinical, neuropsychiatric, neuropsychological, lung function assessment, and serum neurofilament light chain, an axonal damage biomarker. ME/CFS-like features were found in 27% of our sample. ME/CFS-like group showed worse sleep quality, fatigue, pain, depressive symptoms, subjective cognitive complaints, Borg baseline dyspnea of the 6-min walking test vs. those without ME/CFS-like symptoms. These preliminary findings raise concern on a possible future ME/CFS-like pandemic in SARS-CoV-2 survivors.	Diagnosis
34334896	Management outcomes of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients: A preliminary report from a tertiary care hospital. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to be a significant health problem worldwide. The unprecedented surge of mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19 is a new emerging challenge. Although a few studies documenting high incidence of mucormycosis in COVID -19 patients have recently emerged in literature, data pertaining to treatment outcomes in such cohorts is lacking. Here, we report our experience in management of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients at our tertiary care centre. Method: The clinical, imaging, histopathological and treatment data of 20 patients with mucormycosis (in setting of COVID-19) was analysed. Results: 35% and 65 % of cases developed mucormycosis in setting of active and recovered COVID-19 infections respectively. Diabetes mellitus was documented in 80% cases, with 55% demonstrating HbA1c >10%. Steroid was administered in 80% during COVID-19 illness. Imaging demonstrated paranasal sinus (PNS), orbital and intracranial extension in 100%, 55% and 20% patients respectively. All received amphotericin and underwent endoscopic debridement, 20% underwent orbital decompression and 5% maxillectomy with orbital exenteration. 6/20(30%) patients died (4 with rhino-orbito-cerebral disease, 1 with extensive orbito-maxillary involvement and 1 sino-nasal disease). All 6 patients received steroids and documented poor glycaemic control. Conclusion: The strong association of hyperglycemia and steroid intake with mucormycosis in COVID-19 cases warrants judicious use of corticosteroids and optimal glycaemic control. Our study highlights that good clinical outcome can be achieved in invasive mucormycosis provided prompt treatment is instituted with aggressive surgical debridement and antifungal medication.

34369037	Behaviors and Experiences of Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey: A Mixed Methods Study. AIM: To present behaviors and experiences of nurses in Turkey during the current coronavirus pandemic. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic leads to difficulties for most healthcare workers, especially for nurses who mostly accompany patients and are on the front line. METHODS: In the study, a parallel mixed pattern converging quantitative and qualitative research methods was used. RESULTS: The model revealed that 41 years old or older, diabetic, female, single professionals, working in the pandemic department took more personal measures. Five main themes appeared regarding the experiences of the nurses during the pandemic period: (1) Psychological and mental strain; (2) Personal protective equipment; (3) Organizational, physical, and social strains; (4) Change in professional values; (5) Turning the crisis into an opportunity. CONCLUSIONS: Personal measures are associated with the risk status. There is a need to protect nurses with significant measures by providing psycho-social support, meeting their basic needs, and preventing all complications likely to occur due to increasing workload. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: More efforts should be made to ensure good work, fair treatment, no tolerance for discrimination, and equal compensation conditions.	Prevention
34368433	The Impact of COVID-19 on the Care of Patients With Noncommunicable Diseases in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: An Online Survey of Patient Perspectives. We sought to gain insights into the impacts of COVID-19 and associated control measures on health and health care of patients from low- and middle-income countries with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health conditions, using an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most common concern for the 1487 patients who took part was contracting COVID-19 when they accessed health care. Of those infected with COVID-19, half said that their health had been worse since being infected. Collectively, most people reported an increase in feelings of stress and loneliness. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a range of health care impacts on patients with noncommunicable diseases, including constraints on access to care and health effects, particularly mental well-being.

34204705	In Silico Identification of miRNA-lncRNA Interactions in Male Reproductive Disorder Associated with COVID-19 Infection. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a global pandemic, is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitates ACE2-mediated virus entry. Moreover, the expression of ACE2 in the testes of infertile men is higher than normal, which indicates that infertile men may be susceptible to be infected and SARS-CoV-2 may cause reproductive disorder through the pathway induced by ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Little is known about the pathway regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in male reproductive disorder. Since the regulation of gene expression is mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) at the post-transcriptional level, the aim of this study was to analyze the dysregulated miRNA-lncRNA interactions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in male reproductive disorder. Using bioinformatics analysis, we speculate that the predicted miRNAs including miR-125a-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-574-5p, and miR-936 as regulators of ACE2 and miR-204-5p as a modulator of TMPRSS2 are associated with male infertility. The lncRNAs with a tissue-specific expression for testis including GRM7-AS3, ARHGAP26-AS1, BSN-AS1, KRBOX1-AS1, CACNA1C-IT3, AC012361.1, FGF14-IT1, AC012494.1, and GS1-24F4.2 were predicted. The identified miRNAs and lncRNAs are proposed as potential biomarkers to study the possible association between COVID-19 and male infertility. This study encourages further studies of miRNA-lncRNA interactions to explain the molecular mechanisms of male infertility in COVID-19 patients.	Mechanism
34216306	Predictors of survival in older adults hospitalized with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate clinical characteristics associated with mortality and predictors of survival in older adults hospitalized with COVID-19 with a focus on neurological comorbidities and presenting neurological manifestations. METHODS: We compared clinical characteristics in an age- and gender-matched sample of 75 deceased and 75 recovered patients (MAge = 78) hospitalized with COVID-19 and developed a logistic regression to predict likelihood of survival. RESULTS: Deceased patients were more like to have dementia, altered mental status (AMS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, mechanical ventilation, and balance difficulties; higher heart rate, respiratory rate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and absolute neutrophils; lower oxygen saturation and absolute lymphocytes; and shorter length of hospitalization. Logistic regression based on three mortality predictors (ARDS, AMS, and length of hospitalization) correctly predicted 87% of the outcome (89% sensitivity at 85% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: Dementia and AMS were strong predictors of death in older adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Our findings add to the rapidly growing neurology of COVID-19 literature and underscore the importance of early recognition and the incorporation of a mental status examination into the medical assessment of COVID-19.

34203652	Neutralizing Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Titer and Reported Adverse Effects, in a Sample of Italian Nursing Home Personnel after Two Doses of the BNT162b2 Vaccine Administered Four Weeks Apart. BACKGROUND: The immunization of healthcare workers (HCWs) plays a recognized key role in prevention in the COVID-19 pandemic: in Italy, the vaccination campaign began at the end of December 2020. A better knowledge of the on-field immune response in HCWs, of adverse effects and of the main factors involved is fundamental. METHODS: We performed a study on workers at a nursing home in Northern Italy, vaccinated in January-February 2021 with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine four weeks apart, instead of the three weeks provided for in the original manufacturer protocol. One month after the second dose, the serological titer of IgG-neutralizing anti-RBD antibodies of the subunit S1 of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was determined. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects and adverse effects of vaccination were collected by questionnaire. RESULTS: In all of the workers, high antibody titer, ranging between 20 and 760 times the minimum protective level were observed. Titers were significantly higher in subjects with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. Adverse effects after the vaccine were more frequent after the second dose, but no severe adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, even if administered four weeks apart, induced high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgG in all the operators included in the study.

34289526	Reduced pediatric urgent asthma utilization and exacerbations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on healthcare access and utilization, which could have important implications for children with chronic diseases, including asthma. We sought to evaluate changes in healthcare utilization and outcomes in children with asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used electronic health records data to evaluate healthcare use and asthma outcomes in 3959 children and adolescents, 5-17 years of age, with a prior diagnosis of asthma who had a history of well-child visits and encounters within the healthcare system. We assessed all-cause healthcare encounters and asthma exacerbations in the 12-months preceding the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2019-February 29, 2020) and the first 12 months of the pandemic (March 1, 2020-February 28, 2021). All-cause healthcare encounters decreased significantly during the pandemic compared to the preceding year, including well-child visits (48.1% during the pandemic vs. 66.6% in the prior year; p < .01), emergency department visits (9.7% vs. 21.0%; p < .01), and inpatient admissions (1.6% vs. 2.5%; p < .01), though there was over a 100-fold increase in telehealth encounters. Asthma exacerbations that required treatment with systemic steroids also decreased (127 vs. 504 exacerbations; p < .01). Race/ethnicity was not associated with changes in healthcare utilization or asthma outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic corresponded to dramatic shifts in healthcare utilization, including increased telehealth use and improved outcomes among children with asthma. Social distancing measures may have also reduced asthma trigger exposure.	Prevention
34223481	A Case Report of COVID-19 in New Orleans, Louisiana: Highlighting the Complexities of Prognostication in a Critically Ill Patient. Palliative care teams and intensive care teams have experience providing goals-of-care guidance for critically ill patients and families. Critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is defined as infection requiring intensive care unit care, respiratory support, and often multiorgan involvement. This case presents a 53-year-old critically ill COVID-19 patient in multisystem organ failure who appeared hours from death despite best medical efforts. Comfort-focused care and compassionate extubation were offered after all medical teams felt near certain that death was imminent. Overnight, while options were being considered by the family, the patient began to markedly improve hemodynamically and was extubated several days later. Weeks later, the patient survived the hospital stay and was discharged to rehabilitation. After rehabilitation he returned home, able to walk, communicate freely, and independently perform all activities of daily living. Dialysis was no longer necessary and was stopped. The challenges of assisting in goals-of-care conversations for patients with serious COVID-19 infection are discussed.	Case Report
34221445	Surveillance testing for SARS-COV-2 infection in an asymptomatic athlete population: a prospective cohort study with 123 362 tests and 23 463 paired RT-PCR/antigen samples. Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of antigen compared with reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR testing in an asymptomatic athlete screening programme and to monitor infection in college athletes. Methods: Quidel Sofia-2 SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Tests were performed daily before sports participation for football, basketball, wrestling and water polo from 29 September 2020 to 28 February 2021. Paired RT-PCR and antigen tests were performed at least once a week. Positive antigen tests were confirmed with RT-PCR. Results: 81 175 antigen and 42 187 RT-PCR tests were performed, including 23 462 weekly paired antigen/RT-PCR screening tests in 1931 athletes. One hundred and seventy-two athletes had a positive screening RT-PCR (0.4%), of which 83 (48%) occurred on paired testing days. The sensitivity of antigen tests varied with the frequency of RT-PCR testing and prevalence of COVID-19. The sensitivity of antigen testing was 35.7% (95% CI: 17% to 60%) and specificity 99.8% (95% CI: 99.7% to 99.9%) with once-a-week RT-PCR testing after adjusting for school prevalence. Daily antigen testing was similar to RT-PCR testing two to three times a week in identifying infection. Antigen testing identified infection before the next scheduled PCR on 89 occasions and resulted in 234 days where potentially infectious athletes were isolated before they would have been isolated with RT-PCR testing alone. Two athletic-related outbreaks occurred; 86% of total infections were community acquired. Conclusion: Antigen testing has high specificity with a short turnaround time but is not as sensitive as RT-PCR. Daily antigen testing or RT-PCR testing two to three times a week is similar. There are benefits and drawbacks to each testing approach.	Diagnosis
34369124	"COVID-19 Tests the Limits of Biodiversity Laws in a Health Crisis: Rethinking ""Country of Origin"" for Virus Access and Benefit-sharing. The COVID-19 pandemic raises serious questions about the operation of international agreements for accessing and sharing viruses potentially delaying emergency responses. The access and benefit-sharing (ABS) frameworks under the United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity and its Nagoya Protocol apply to the collection and use of the COVID-19 pathogen SARS-CoV-2. These frameworks aim to ensure countries of origin reap some of the benefits from the use of their resources. Using real-world examples, we demonstrate conceptual and definitional ambiguities relating to ""country of origin"" that make not only operationalising the ABS scheme for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use objectives difficult but may also undermine public health emergency responses. Understanding how COVID-19 fits (or does not fit) within ABS laws is a valuable exercise for international policy-makers trying to determine how best to operationalise pathogen ABS, an issue currently under examination at the World Health Organization and critical to responding to pandemics."

34204305	"The Functional Consequences of the Novel Ribosomal Pausing Site in SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S protein) acquired a unique new 4 amino acid -PRRA- insertion sequence at amino acid residues (aa) 681-684 that forms a new furin cleavage site in S protein as well as several new glycosylation sites. We studied various statistical properties of the -PRRA- insertion at the RNA level (CCUCGGCGGGCA). The nucleotide composition and codon usage of this sequence are different from the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. One of such features is two tandem CGG codons, although the CGG codon is the rarest codon in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This suggests that the insertion sequence could cause ribosome pausing as the result of these rare codons. Due to population variants, the Nextstrain divergence measure of the CCU codon is extremely large. We cannot exclude that this divergence might affect host immune responses/effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, possibilities awaiting further investigation. Our experimental studies show that the expression level of original RNA sequence ""wildtype"" spike protein is much lower than for codon-optimized spike protein in all studied cell lines. Interestingly, the original spike sequence produces a higher titer of pseudoviral particles and a higher level of infection. Further mutagenesis experiments suggest that this dual-effect insert, comprised of a combination of overlapping translation pausing and furin sites, has allowed SARS-CoV-2 to infect its new host (human) more readily. This underlines the importance of ribosome pausing to allow efficient regulation of protein expression and also of cotranslational subdomain folding."	Mechanism;Treatment
34211951	Radiomics Is Effective for Distinguishing Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia From Influenza Virus Pneumonia. Objectives: To develop and validate a radiomics model for distinguishing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia from influenza virus pneumonia. Materials and Methods: A radiomics model was developed on the basis of 56 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and 90 patients with influenza virus pneumonia in this retrospective study. Radiomics features were extracted from CT images. The radiomics features were reduced by the Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. The radiomics model was built using the multivariate backward stepwise logistic regression. A nomogram of the radiomics model was established, and the decision curve showed the clinical usefulness of the radiomics nomogram. Results: The radiomics features, consisting of nine selected features, were significantly different between COVID-19 pneumonia and influenza virus pneumonia in both training and validation data sets. The receiver operator characteristic curve of the radiomics model showed good discrimination in the training sample [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.909; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.859-0.958] and in the validation sample (AUC, 0.911; 95% CI, 0.753-1.000). The nomogram was established and had good calibration. Decision curve analysis showed that the radiomics nomogram was clinically useful. Conclusions: The radiomics model has good performance for distinguishing COVID-19 pneumonia from influenza virus pneumonia and may aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.	Diagnosis
34212320	Increased Levels of serum Pentraxin 3 in Critical Coronavirus Disease-2019 Patients. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and ficolin are the plasma phase of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and can activate complement through classical and lectin pathways, respectively, which may contribute to disease severity. This study aimed to investigate the association between PTX3 and ficolin with disease severity in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Seventy-three COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The participants were divided into three groups as follows: 14 patients as the intensive care unit (ICU) group, 59 patients as the non-ICU group, and 25 subjects as the healthy control group. The serum levels of PTX3 and ficolin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Patients in ICU and non-ICU groups had significantly higher levels of PTX3 compared to the healthy control group (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0072, respectively). Patients in the ICU group also had an increased amount of PTX3 (1957 +/- 1769 pg/ml) compared to non-ICU patients (1220 +/- 1784 pg/ml). However, this difference was not significant. On the other hand, serum levels of ficolin were not different among the three groups. PTX3, as an acute phase protein, may contribute to disease severity. Its probable inflammatory role could result from the high activation of the complement system. On the other hand, it could be suggested that ficolin has no crucial role in the disease severity of COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Treatment
34203542	Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Bronchiolitis Hospitalizations: The Experience of an Italian Tertiary Center. SARS-CoV-2 pandemic restrictions have deeply altered the common respiratory illnesses burden. The aim of this paper was to clarify how these measures may have influenced bronchiolitis epidemiology, exploring possible explanations. We studied 342 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis at our center from four different epidemic seasons (October-April 2017-2018, 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021). March-April hospitalization rate, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) infection, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission and oxygen therapy administration data were compared among different seasons to outline any changes during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. In March-April, 30 (23.1%), 28 (24.6%) and 5 (5.1%) infants were hospitalized for bronchiolitis, respectively, in 2017-2018, 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, with a lower rate in March-April 2020 (p < 0.001). No hospitalizations for bronchiolitis occurred during the epidemic season of 2020-2021. No significant differences in RSV infections, oxygen therapy administration and PICU admissions across seasons were outlined. In conclusion, we report a severe decrease in hospitalizations for bronchiolitis at our center throughout the entire SARS-CoV-2 outbreak rather than only during the lockdown periods. This seems to suggest a pivotal role for the systematic implementation of cost-effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as compulsory face masks and hand hygiene, which were deployed for the entire pandemic, in reducing the circulation of infectious agents.

34218245	The presence of anti-leucocyte antibodies in the plasma of convalescent women after SARS-CoV-2 infection as a reason for disqualification for plasma therapy - analysis based on a literature review. According to the data from November 29 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was responsible for 61 866 635 cases of infections and 1 448 990 deaths worldwide, and the number is still growing rapidly. The main problem is the rapid increase in the number of patients with pneumonia complicated by respiratory failure. In the treatment of COVID- 19 patients, a significant effect of convalescent plasma (CP) therapy from convalescent patients with SARS-CoV-2 IgG neutralizing antibodies is indicated. After this procedure, the total duration of the infection was shortened and the clinical condition improved faster than in patients who did not receive this form of therapy. The aim of the study was to explain the cause disqualifying women with anti-leucocyte anitibodies as CP plasma donors for COVID-19 patients. However, according to the literature, 2% of patients who received plasma from convalescents developed Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI). The most common causes of TRALI are anti-leukocyte antibodies directed against Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) class I and II and against Human Neutrophil Antigens (HNA). Therefore, patients with COVID-19 may only be transfused with plasma from convalescent women with a history of pregnancy after testing negative for anti-leucocyte antibodies in the pre-plasmapheresis blood sample.

34366530	Covid-19 in Parkinson's Disease treated by drugs or brain stimulation. PURPOSE: Covid-19 has affected all people, especially those with chronic diseases, including Parkinson's Disease (PD). Covid-19 may affect both motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD patients. We intend to evaluate different aspects of Covid-19 impact on PD patients. METHODS: 647 PD patients were evaluated in terms of PD-related and Covid-19-related clinical presentations in addition to past medical history during the pandemic through an online questioner. They were compared with an age-matched control group consist of 673 individuals and a sample of the normal population consist of 1215 individuals. RESULTS: The prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients was 11.28%. The mortality was 1.23% among PD patients. The prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who undergone Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) was 18.18%. No significant association was found between the duration of disease and the prevalence of Covid-19. A statistically significant higher prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who had direct contact with SARS-CoV-19 infected individuals was found. No statistically significant association has been found between the worsening of motor symptoms and Covid-19. PD patients and the normal population may differ in the prevalence of some psychological disorders, including anxiety and sleeping disorders, and Covid-19 may affect the psychological status. CONCLUSION: PD patients possibly follow tighter preventive protocols, which lead to lower prevalence and severity of Covid-19 and its consequences in these patients. Although it seems Covid-19 does not affect motor and psychological aspects of PD as much as it was expected, more accurate evaluations are suggested in order to clarify such effects.

34222739	FIB-4 Predicts Need for Mechanical Ventilation in a Multi-ethnic National cohort of COVID-19. Background: Simple tests of routine data are needed in those with coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2019, or COVID-19 to help identify those you may need mechanical ventilation (MV). Objective: To determine if FIB-4 is associated need for MV in a multi-ethnic, national cohort of patients with COVID-19 and if so, to determine the optimal FIB-4 cutoff. Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective national cohort study of adults seen in an ambulatory or emergency department setting diagnosed with COVID-19 identified using the TriNetX platform. Measures included demographics, comorbid diseases, and routine laboratory tests. Results: A total of 4901 patients with COVID-19 were included: mean age was 56, 48% female, 42% obese, 38% White, 40% Black, cardiac disease 15%, diabetes mellitus (DM) 39%, liver disease 20%, and respiratory disease 50%. Need for MV was 6%. The optimal cutoff FIB-4 for need for mechanical ventilation was 3.04 (AUC 0.735) which had a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 42%, 77%, 11%, and 95%, respectively with 93% accuracy. When stratified by race, increased FIB-4 remained associated with need for mechanical ventilation in both Whites and Blacks. Conclusions: FIB-4 can be used by front line providers to identify which patients may require MV.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34216998	Multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and COVID-19: A pandemic year in Czechia. BACKGROUND: When the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared, concerns about its course in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) arose. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, severity and risk factors of the more severe COVID-19 course among MS and NMOSD patients. METHODS: From March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021, 12 MS centres, representing 70% of the Czech MS and NMOSD population, reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases via the Czech nationwide register of MS and NMOSD patients (ReMuS). The main outcome was COVID-19 severity assessed on an 8-point scale with a cut-off at 4 (radiologically confirmed pneumonia) according to the World Health Organisation s (WHO) COVID-19 severity assessment. RESULTS: We identified 958 MS and 13 NMOSD patients, 50 MS and 4 NMOSD patients had pneumonia, 3 MS and 2 NMOSD patients died. The incidence of COVID-19 among patients with MS seems to be similar to the general Czech population. A multivariate logistic regression determined that higher body mass index (BMI [OR 1.07, 95% CI, 1.00-1.14]), older age (OR per 10 years 2.01, 95% CI, 1.41-2.91), high-dose glucocorticoid treatment during the 2 months before COVID-19 onset (OR 2.83, 95% CI, 0.10-7.48) and anti-CD20 therapy (OR 7.04, 95% CI, 3.10-15.87) were independent variables associated with pneumonia in MS patients. Increase odds of pneumonia in anti-CD20 treated MS patients compared to patients with other disease-modifying therapy (same age, sex, BMI, high-dose glucocorticoid treatment during the 2 months before COVID-19 onset, presence of pulmonary comorbidity) were confirmed by propensity score matching (OR 8.90, 95% CI, 3.04-33.24). Reports on COVID-19 infection in patients with NMOSD are scarce, however, data available up to now suggest a high risk of a more severe COVID-19 course as well as a higher mortality rate among NMOSD patients. In our cohort, 4 NMOSD patients (30.77%) had the more severe COVID-19 course and 2 patients (15.39%) died. CONCLUSION: The majority of MS patients had a mild COVID-19 course contrary to NMOSD patients, however, higher BMI and age, anti-CD20 therapy and high-dose glucocorticoid treatment during the 2 months before COVID-19 onset were associated with pneumonia. Based on this study, we have already started an early administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and preferential vaccination in the risk group of patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34204970	Representations of Psychoactive Drugs' Use in Mass Culture and Their Impact on Audiences. Drug use has been increasing worldwide over recent decades. Apart from the determinants of drug initiation established in numerous studies, the authors wish to draw attention to other equally important factors, which may contribute to augmenting this phenomenon. The article aims to draw attention to the content of mass culture, especially representations of drug use in mass media, which may influence the liberalization of attitudes towards drugs and their use. The role of mass culture and its impact on the audience is discussed. It presents an overview of drug representations in the content of mass culture, e.g., in film, music, literature, and the occurrence of drug references in everyday products, e.g., food, clothes, and cosmetics. Attention was drawn to liberal attitudes of celebrities and their admissions to drug use, particularly to the impact of the presented positions on the attitudes of the audience, especially young people for whom musicians, actors, and celebrities are regarded as authorities. Indications for further preventive actions were also presented. Attention was drawn to the need to take appropriate action due to the time of the COVID-19 pandemic when many people staying at home (due to lockdown or quarantine) have the possibility of much more frequent contact with mass culture content, which may distort the image of drugs.

34376569	Two doses of the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine enhances antibody responses to variants in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the impact of prior infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the response to vaccination is a priority for responding to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In particular, it is necessary to understand how prior infection plus vaccination can modulate immune responses against variants of concern. To address this, we sampled 20 individuals with and 25 individuals without confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection from a large cohort of healthcare workers followed serologically since April 2020. All 45 individuals had received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech BTN162b2 vaccine with a delayed booster at 10 weeks. Absolute and neutralizing antibody titers against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and variants were measured using enzyme immunoassays and pseudotype neutralization assays. We observed antibody reactivity against lineage A, B.1.351 and P.1 variants with increasing antigenic exposure, either through vaccination or natural infection. This improvement was further confirmed in neutralization assays using fixed dilutions of serum samples. The impact of antigenic exposure was more evident in enzyme immunoassays measuring SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific IgG antibody concentrations. Our data show that multiple exposures to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the context of a delayed booster expand the neutralizing breadth of the antibody response to neutralization-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants. This suggests that additional vaccine boosts may be beneficial in improving immune responses against future SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.	Mechanism;Treatment
34372563	Do Dogs and Cats Passively Carry SARS-CoV-2 on Hair and Pads? The epidemiological role of domestic animals in the spread and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans has been investigated in recent reports, but some aspects need to be further clarified. To date, only in rare cases have dogs and cats living with COVID-19 patients been found to harbour SARS-CoV-2, with no evidence of pet-to-human transmission. The aim of the present study was to verify whether dogs and cats act as passive mechanical carriers of SARS-CoV-2 when they live in close contact with COVID-19 patients. Cutaneous and interdigital swabs collected from 48 dogs and 15 cats owned by COVID-19 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR. The time elapsed between owner swab positivity and sample collection from pets ranged from 1 to 72 days, with a median time of 23 days for dogs and 39 days for cats. All samples tested negative, suggesting that pets do not passively carry SARS-CoV-2 on their hair and pads, and thus they likely do not play an important role in the virus transmission to humans. This data may contribute to confirming that the direct contact with the hair and pads of pets does not represent a route for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.	Transmission;Diagnosis
34212925	Assessing the ratio between new Covid-19 cases and new tests for Sars-Cov-2 in Italy by fractal investigation. AIM: processing the heterogeneous data on the Italian Covid-19 epidemic by fractal investigation on the trend curve of the ratio between new Covid19 cases/new Sars-Cov-2 tests. METHODS: New cases of Covid-19 disease and new tests were calculated from raw data freely available on the Italian governing website. The effectiveness of Italian government Decrees aiming to obtain lock-down was assessed by fractal investigation. Self-similarity parameters of presumed fractal shapes obtained 6 days after each Decree were estimated, when possible. Self-organized criticality was also assessed to check for chaos involvement in disturbing the fractal shapes. Shapes were then compared and were used to estimate the number of new tests for Sars-Cov-2 that Italy would be able to perform. RESULTS: The full lock-down changed the biocomplexity of the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy. If the biocomplexity of Covid-19 did not change after the lock-down, Italy should have been able to perform at least 25490 tests daily (+/-8940) on average, while real data show that a larger number of tests were done (p<0.001) (thereby obtaining the lowering of contagions). If the same biocomplexity was observed before full lock down, Italy would be able to perform 7088 tests daily (+/-5163) on average, while real data show that a lower number of tests were done (p=0.029) (thereby observing the worsening of contagions). CONCLUSION: in case of heterogeneous data, fractal investigation would be prove useful for assessing and estimating trends.	Prevention
34284268	Potential molecular mechanisms of zinc- and copper-mediated antiviral activity on COVID-19. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread across the globe; and surprisingly, no potentially protective or therapeutic antiviral molecules are available to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) have been shown to exert protective effects due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties. Therefore, it is hypothesized that supplementation with Zn and Cu alone or as an adjuvant may be beneficial with promising efficacy and a favorable safety profile to mitigate symptoms, as well as halt progression of the severe form of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective of this review is to discuss the proposed underlying molecular mechanisms and their implications for combating SARS-CoV-2 infection in response to Zn and Cu administration. Several clinical trials have also included the use of Zn as an adjuvant therapy with dietary regimens/antiviral drugs against COVID-19 infection. Overall, this review summarizes that nutritional intervention with Zn and Cu may offer an alternative treatment strategy by eliciting their virucidal effects through several fundamental molecular cascades, such as, modulation of immune responses, redox signaling, autophagy, and obstruction of viral entry and genome replication during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

34367452	Case report: cerebral thromboembolism in an unconscious COVID-19 patient in intensive care. Although the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) being more frequently related to acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute cardiac and renal injuries, thromboembolic events have been increasingly reported. Acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus 2) often requires intensive care follow-up. As well as respiratory failure, the SARS-CoV-2 may cause central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The pandemic has raised many challenges in managing critically ill older adults, a population preferentially killed by COVID-19. The mortality and morbidity rates are extremely high in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Recent studies have reported the potential development of a hypercoagulable state in COVID-19. Viral infections and hypoxia may cause these state. It is increasingly reported that thromboembolic events are associated with a poor prognosis. Due to these thromboembolic complications, COVID-19 patients often have neurological symptoms. These symptoms may not be observed in intensive care patients who are sedated. We report one case who was sedated COVID-19 pneumonia and who was later diagnosed with cerebral venous thrombosis with cranial imaging when he could not awaken even though sedation was discontinued. Since COVID-19 causes intense thrombotic susceptibility due to cytokine storm, cerebrovascular thromboembolic complications associated with COVID-19 infection should be considered first and foremost for unconsciousness ventilated patients. Severe and potentially cerebral thrombosis may prolong the patient s stay in intensive care.	Case Report
34286175	Aerosol Generation in Ear Canal and Air-Fluid Interface Suction. Objective: The identification of aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) is important during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic due to aerosol-mediated virus transmission. Aerosol measurement during clinical procedures using particle counting may be confounded by variable natural background aerosol levels or limited by partial volume sampling. The study objective was to quantify any significant aerosol generated from simulated suction clearance procedures. Study Design: Prospective quantification of aerosol generation during clinical suction simulation. Setting: Clean chamber. Methods: We created a clean environment for particle counting in a transparent neutralized polypropylene chamber. Air was passed through a HEPA 14 class filter to maintain a constant chamber inlet pressure. An optical particle counter was connected in line to the chamber exhaust vent to measure all of the vented particles. The chamber background count was 1 particle >/=0.3 microm per 15 minutes at a flow rate of 1 chamber air change per minute. We used this system to quantify very low aerosol counts generated from suction clearance of a silicone ear canal and at an open air-fluid interface. Results: No clinically significant aerosol generation was found by particle counting of the whole chamber air volume during simulated suction procedures. Conclusion: Simulated ear suction clearance and air-fluid interface suction does not generate any significant aerosol. It appears likely that any aerosol potentially generated at the suction tube tip is entrained by incoming air flow. This is the first study to quantify aerosols generated by suction in a controlled environment; further research is required to determine its clinical implications.	Prevention
34224675	BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine and correlates of humoral immune responses and dynamics: a prospective, single-centre, longitudinal cohort study in health-care workers. BACKGROUND: Concurrent with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine roll-out in Israel initiated on Dec 19, 2020, we assessed the early antibody responses and antibody kinetics after each vaccine dose in health-care workers of different ages and sexes, and with different comorbidities. METHODS: We did a prospective, single-centre, longitudinal cohort study at the Sheba Medical Centre (Tel-Hashomer, Israel). Eligible participants were health-care workers at the centre who had a negative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay before receiving the first dose of the intramuscular vaccine, and at least one serological antibody test after the first dose of the vaccine. Health-care workers with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test before vaccination, a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology test before vaccination, or infection with COVID-19 after vaccination were excluded from the study. Participants were followed up weekly for 5 weeks after the first vaccine dose; a second dose was given at week 3. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and at each weekly follow-up, and antibodies were tested at 1-2 weeks after the first vaccine dose, at week 3 with the administration of the second vaccine dose, and at weeks 4-5 (ie, 1-2 weeks after the second vaccine dose). Participants with comorbidities were approached to participate in an enriched comorbidities subgroup, and at least two neutralising assays were done during the 5 weeks of follow-up in those individuals. IgG assays were done for the entire study population, whereas IgM, IgA, and neutralising antibody assays were done only in the enriched comorbidities subgroup. Concentrations of IgG greater than 0.62 sample-to-cutoff (s/co) ratio and of IgA greater than 1.1 s/co, and titres of neutralising antibodies greater than 10 were considered positive. Scatter plot and correlation analyses, logistic and linear regression analyses, and linear mixed models were used to investigate the longitudinal antibody responses. FINDINGS: Between Dec 19, 2020, and Jan 30, 2021, we obtained 4026 serum samples from 2607 eligible, vaccinated participants. 342 individuals were included in the enriched comorbidities subgroup. The first vaccine dose elicited positive IgG and neutralising antibody responses at week 3 in 707 (88.0%) of 803 individuals, and 264 (71.0%) of 372 individuals, respectively, which were rapidly increased at week 4 (ie, 1 week after the second vaccine dose) in 1011 (98.4%) of 1027 and 357 (96.5%) of 370 individuals, respectively. Over 4 weeks of follow-up after vaccination, a high correlation (r=0.92) was detected between IgG against the receptor-binding domain and neutralising antibody titres. First-dose induced IgG response was significantly lower in individuals aged 66 years and older (ratio of means 0.25, 95% CI 0.19-0.31) and immunosuppressed individuals (0.21, 0.14-0.31) compared with individuals aged 18.00-45.99 years and individuals with no immunosuppression, respectively. This disparity was partly abrogated following the second dose. Overall, endpoint regression analysis showed that lower antibody concentrations were consistently associated with male sex (ratio of means 0.84, 95% CI 0.80-0.89), older age (ie, >/=66 years; 0.64, 0.58-0.71), immunosuppression (0.44, 0.33-0.58), and other specific comorbidities: diabetes (0.88, 0.79-0.98), hypertension (0.90, 0.82-0.98), heart disease (0.86, 0.75-1.00), and autoimmune diseases (0.82, 0.73-0.92). INTERPRETATION: BNT162b2 vaccine induces a robust and rapid antibody response. The significant correlation between receptor-binding domain IgG antibodies and neutralisation titres suggests that IgG antibodies might serve as a correlate of neutralisation. The second vaccine dose is particularly important for older and immunosuppressed individuals, highlighting the need for timely second vaccinations and potentially a revaluation of the long gap between doses in some countries. Antibody responses were reduced in susceptible populations and therefore they might be more prone to breakthrough infections. FUNDING: Sheba Medical Center, Israel Ministry of Health.

34333906	ALLERGIC REACTIONS AGAINST COVID-19 VACCINES. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected the whole world in a short time. One of the most influential public health initiatives modern medicine has to offer, the vaccine has become even more important as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen worldwide. Many vaccine trials were launched during the COVID-19 pandemic and these vaccines were widely used around the world, offering realistic hope for ending the pandemic. Allergic reactions to vaccines were reported shortly after their approval. These reactions in general, are rare but they can in some circumstances be serious. Allergy to vaccines can occur because of either the active vaccine component or vaccine ingredients. The spectrum of the reactions may be just a local hypersensitiviy reaction or may be as severe as an anaphylaxis which is an acute severe, life-threatening systemic hypersensitive reaction and it requires quick intervention. If an allergy is suspected, a correct examination followed by algorithms is important for true diagnosis, treatment and decision regarding re-vaccination. Patients who experience an allergic reaction with the first dose of covid 19 vaccine should be directed to the allergy-immunologist and the evaluation of at-risk patients should be individualized. Finally, we should point out that the benefits of current COVID-19 vaccines go far beyond the side effects, and that the vaccine is the most important way to recover from the pandemic.

34216120	"Which Group Should be Vaccinated First?: A Systematic Review. BACKGROUND: Since the supply of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines will be limited worldwide, it is essential to prioritize vaccination based on scientific evidence. Although several frameworks and studies on vaccine distribution have been published, no published systematic review has evaluated the prioritization of the COVID-19 vaccine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched 4 different databases, PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and EMBASE for articles published between January 2019 and December 31, 2020. Studies were included if they contained the primary search terms ""vaccine"", ""COVID-19"", and ""prioritization"". In addition, we manually included reports from national and international websites. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, older adults were the most frequently mentioned group, and healthcare workers (HCWs) were mentioned as the 1st priority group. HCWs and patients with comorbidities were the 2nd and 3rd most frequently mentioned groups in the reviewed papers. Reducing severe COVID-19 was the most frequently mentioned goal. CONCLUSION: Since vaccination programs have been initiated in several countries, scientific evidence on vaccination prioritization is needed to increase our knowledge of general vaccine prioritization and improve vaccine acceptance. Our results showed that HCWs and older adults were the most frequently valued in studies."	Prevention
34373622	Inflammasome activation at the crux of severe COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), results in life-threatening disease in a minority of patients, especially elderly people and those with co-morbidities such as obesity and diabetes. Severe disease is characterized by dysregulated cytokine release, pneumonia and acute lung injury, which can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, multisystem failure and death. However, a mechanistic understanding of COVID-19 progression remains unclear. Here we review evidence that SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly activates inflammasomes, which are large multiprotein assemblies that are broadly responsive to pathogen-associated and stress-associated cellular insults, leading to secretion of the pleiotropic IL-1 family cytokines (IL-1beta and IL-18), and pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death. We further discuss potential mechanisms of inflammasome activation and clinical efforts currently under way to suppress inflammation to prevent or ameliorate severe COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34343962	A familial cluster of COVID-19 infection in a northern Chinese region. OBJECTIVE: Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide and become a global health concern. Here, we report a familial cluster of six patients infected with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a northern Chinese region and share our local experience with regard the control of COVID-19. METHODS: The demographic data, clinical features, laboratory examinations, and epidemiological characteristics of enrolled cases were collected and analyzed. Two family members (Cases 1 and 2) had Hubei exposure history and were admitted to the hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19; eight familial members who had contact with them during the incubation period underwent quarantine in a hospital. We closely followed up all the family members and analyzed their clinical outcome. RESULTS: Case 3 had negative SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results but was suspected to have COVID-19 because of radiographic abnormalities. Cases 4 and 5 developed symptomatic COVID-19. Case 6 was considered an asymptomatic carrier as his SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was positive. The other four family members with close contacts to COVID-19 patients had no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 has infectivity during the incubation period and preventive quarantine is effective for controlling an outbreak of COVID-19 infection.	Case Report

(1) Background: The evaluation of anti-spike protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) antibodies represents a useful tool to estimate the individual protection against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection; (2) Methods: We evaluated anti S-RBD IgG levels by indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay on Maglumi 800 (SNIBE, California) in 2248 vaccinated subjects without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, 91 vaccinated individuals recovered from COVID-19, and 268 individuals recovered from COVID-19 who had not been vaccinated. Among those who were healthy and vaccinated, 352 subjects performed a re-dosing after about 72 days from the first measurement. (3) Results: Anti S-RBD IgG levels were lower in subjects with previous infection than vaccinated subjects, with or without previous infection (p < 0.001). No difference was observed between vaccinated subjects, with and without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, anti-RBD IgG levels were higher in females than males (2110 vs. 1341 BAU/mL; p < 0.001) as well as in subjects with symptoms after vaccination than asymptomatic ones (2085 vs. 1332 BAU/mL; p = 0.001) and lower in older than younger subjects. Finally, a significant decrease in anti-RBD IgG levels was observed within a short period from a complete two-dose cycle vaccination. (4) Conclusions: Our results show an efficacy antibody response after vaccination with age-, time- and sex-related differences.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34215539	New Zealand maternity and midwifery services and the COVID-19 response: A systematic scoping review. PROBLEM: COVID-19 guidance from professional and health organisations created uncertainty leading to professional and personal stress impacting on midwives providing continuity of care in New Zealand (NZ). The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in massive amounts of international and national information and guidance. This guidance was often conflicting and not suited to New Zealand midwifery. AIM: To examine and map the national and international guidance and information provided to midwifery regarding COVID-19 and foreground learnt lessons for future similar crises. METHODS: A systematic scoping review informed by Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework. A range of sources from grey and empirical literature was identified and 257 sources included. FINDINGS: Four categories were identified and discussed: (1) guidance for provision of maternity care in the community; (2) guidance for provision of primary labour and birth care; (3) Guidance for midwifery care to women/wahine with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 infection, including screening processes and management of neonates of infected women/wahine (4) Guidance for midwives on protecting self and own families and whanau (extended family) from COVID-19 exposure. CONCLUSION: Guidance was mainly targeted and tailored for hospital-based services. This was at odds with the NZ context, where primary continuity of care underpins practice. It is evident that those providing continuity of care constantly needed to navigate an evolving situation to mitigate interruptions and restrictions to midwifery care, often without fully knowing the personal risk to themselves and their own families. A key message is the need for a single source of evidence-based guidance, regularly updated and timestamped to show where advice changes over time.	Prevention
34228583	Acute Retinal Necrosis as a presenting ophthalmic manifestation in COVID 19 recovered patients. Purpose: Infection by the SARS-CoV2 virus results in an immune dysregulated state which can predispose to reactivation of Herpes viruses. This report describes the development of Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN) in two patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV2 infection.Methods: Observational report of two consecutive patients who presented with ARN after having recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection.Results: Case 1 was a 5-year-old child with extensive peripheral necrotizing retinitis. Case 2 was a 61-year-old gentlemen with bilateral retinal detachment with sieve-like breaks and optic atrophy. Both patients had recovered from SARS- Cov-2 infection 1 month ago. PCR from vitreous sample of both patients was positive for Herpes simplex virus. Case 1 was treated with oral valacyclovir. Case 2 underwent surgery in both eyes for retinal detachmentConclusion: Immune dysregulation after COVID-19 infection can result in reactivation of herpesvirus and may lead to development of ARN.

34333238	"Neurochemical signs of astrocytic and neuronal injury in acute COVID-19 normalizes during long-term follow-up. BACKGROUND: Neurologic manifestations are well-recognized features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the longitudinal association of biomarkers reflecting CNS impact and neurological symptoms is not known. We sought to determine whether plasma biomarkers of CNS injury were associated with neurologic sequelae after COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with confirmed acute COVID-19 were studied prospectively. Neurological symptoms were recorded during the acute phase of the disease and at six months follow-up, and blood samples were collected longitudinally. Healthy age-matched individuals were included as controls. We analysed plasma concentrations of neurofilament light-chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp), and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15). FINDINGS: One hundred patients with mild (n = 24), moderate (n = 28), and severe (n = 48) COVID-19 were followed for a median (IQR) of 225 (187-262) days. In the acute phase, patients with severe COVID-19 had higher concentrations of NfL than all other groups (all p < 0.001), and higher GFAp than controls (p < 0.001). GFAp was also significantly increased in moderate disease (p < 0.05) compared with controls. NfL (r = 0.53, p < 0.001) and GFAp (r = 0.39, p < 0.001) correlated with GDF-15 during the acute phase. After six months, NfL and GFAp concentrations had normalized, with no persisting group differences. Despite this, 50 patients reported persistent neurological symptoms, most commonly fatigue (n = 40), ""brain-fog"" (n = 29), and changes in cognition (n = 25). We found no correlation between persistent neurological symptoms and CNS injury biomarkers in the acute phase. INTERPRETATION: The normalization of CNS injury biomarkers in all individuals, regardless of previous disease severity or persisting neurological symptoms, indicates that post COVID-19 neurological sequelae are not accompanied by ongoing CNS injury.

34346750	Differential Antibody Response to mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines in Healthy Subjects. Knowledge about development and duration of virus-specific antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination is important for understanding how to limit the pandemic via vaccination in different populations and societies. However, the clinical utility of postvaccination testing of antibody response and selection of targeted SARS-CoV-2 antigen(s) has not been established. The results of such testing from clinical teams independent from vaccine manufacturers are also limited. Here, we report the initial results of an ongoing clinical study on evaluation of antibody response to four different SARS-CoV-2 antigens after first and second dose of Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines and at later time points. We revealed a peak of antibody induction after the vaccine boosting dose with a gradual decline of antibody levels at later time. Anti-nucleocapsid antibody was not induced by spike protein-encoding vaccines and this may continue to serve as a marker of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. No differences between the two vaccines in terms of antibody response were revealed. Age and gender dependencies were determined to be minimal within the healthy adult (but not aged) population. Our results suggest that postvaccination testing of antibody response is an important and feasible tool for following people after vaccination and selecting individuals who might require a third dose of vaccine at an earlier time point or persons who may not need a second dose due to previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Now that authorized vaccines for COVID-19 have been widely used, it is important to understand how they induce antivirus antibodies, which antigens are targeted, how long antibodies circulate, and how personal health conditions and age may affect this humoral immunity. Here, we report induction and time course of multiple anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in healthy individuals immunized with Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines. We also determined the age and gender dependence of the antibody response and compared antibody levels to responses seen in those who have recovered from COVID-19. Our results suggest the importance of screening for antibody response to multiple antigens after vaccination in order to reveal individuals who require early and late additional boosting and those who may not need second dose due to prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In late 2019, the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the viral agent responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Coronaviruses Spike proteins are responsible for their ability to interact with host membrane receptors and different proteins have been identified as SARS-CoV-2 interactors, among which Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and Basigin2/EMMPRIN/CD147 (CD147). CD147 plays an important role in human immunodeficiency virus type 1, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections. In particular, SARS-CoV recognizes the CD147 receptor expressed on the surface of host cells by its nucleocapsid protein binding to cyclophilin A (CyPA), a ligand for CD147. However, the involvement of CD147 in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still debated. Interference with both the function (blocking antibody) and the expression (knock down) of CD147 showed that this receptor partakes in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provided additional clues on the underlying mechanism: CD147 binding to CyPA does not play a role; CD147 regulates ACE2 levels and both receptors are affected by virus infection. Altogether, these findings suggest that CD147 is involved in SARS-CoV-2 tropism and represents a possible therapeutic target to challenge COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34205940	DIC-Like Syndrome Following Administration of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 Vaccination. In recent weeks, adverse reactions have been reported after administration of Oxford-AstraZeneca chimpanzee adenovirus vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in particular thrombus formation, which has led several European Countries to discontinue administration of this vaccine. On March 8, 2021, the European Medicines Agency Safety Committee did not confirm this probable association. We report the case of a patient who developed disseminated intravascular coagulation after the first dose of Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine, which resolved in a few days with the administration of dexamethasone and enoxaparin. This work demonstrates the safety of the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine and that any development of side effects can be easily managed with a prompt diagnosis and in a short time with a few commonly used drugs.

34132881	[Does methotrexate influence the efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2?] The question whether an ongoing treatment with methotrexate (MTX) actually impairs the protective immune response after SARS-CoV2 vaccination cannot be answered with certainty on the basis of the available data. However, in view of the fact that a short discontinuation (once or twice) of the weekly MTX treatment in patients with a stable disease situation is probably associated with a comparatively low risk of inducing a flare of the underlying inflammatory rheumatic disease, such a short discontinuation of treatment can be considered according to the individual decision involving the patient and the treating rheumatologist. Nevertheless, discontinuation of MTX treatment does not appear to be absolutely necessary-especially since discontinuation would have to occur twice within a short period of time for most COVID-19 vaccines. Under no circumstances should longer periods of discontinuation of treatment be considered as this could result in a flare of the underlying disease. A more detailed assessment of the data situation and the resulting consequences (also with respect to DMARD) will follow soon in the updated recommendations for action of the German Society for Rheumatology (DGRh) on the management of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases in the context of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, especially COVID-19.

34377701	Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis with Cystic Lesion Concomitant with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 causes severe acute respiratory distress and other clinical complications such as thromboembolic events and gastrointestinal tract disorders, which generally present with abdominal pain. In the case report, we describe a patient who had severe viral necrotizing pancreatitis associated with COVID-19 infection. LEARNING POINTS: In patients with COVID-19, gastrointestinal symptoms should raise suspicion of pancreatitis and additional evaluation should be carried out.Further research to investigate if COVID-19 is associated with acute pancreatitis is warranted.

34219243	"Bradyarrhythmias in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: A narrative review and a clinical report. Several cardiovascular diseases and arrhythmic disorders have been described in COVID-19 era as likely related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prognostic relevance of bradyarrhythmias during the infection has not been yet described and no data are available about long-term heart conduction disorders. A review of literature concerning the association between hypokinetic arrhythmias and COVID-19 from January 2020 to February 2021 was performed. The key-words used for the research were: ""sinus node disfunction,"" ""sick sinus syndrome (SSS),"" ""sino-atrial block,"" ""atrio-ventricular block (AVB),"" ""bradyarrhythmias,"" and ""COVID-19'' or ""SARS-CoV-2.'' Excluding ""relative bradycardia,"" a total of 38 cases of bradyarrhythmia related to SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described, even in very young people, requiring in many cases a definitive pacemaker implantation. Furthermore, we report a case of non-hospitalized 47-years old man with a SSS developed as a consequence of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. While in all described cases heart conduction disorders were found at presentation of the infection or during hospitalization for COVID-19, in our case the diagnosis of SSS was made after the resolution of the infection. Although rarely, heart conduction disorders may occur during COVID-19 and the present case highlights that a cardiological follow up may be desirable even after the resolution of infection, especially in the presence of symptoms suggesting a possible heart involvement."

34228753	Characterization of low-density granulocytes in COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by extensive pulmonary complications, to which host immune responses are believed to play a role. As the major arm of innate immunity, neutrophils are one of the first cells recruited to the site of infection where their excessive activation can contribute to lung pathology. Low-density granulocytes (LDGs) are circulating neutrophils, whose numbers increase in some autoimmune diseases and cancer, but are poorly characterized in acute viral infections. Using flow cytometry, we detected a significant increase of LDGs in the blood of acute COVID-19 patients, compared to healthy controls. Based on their surface marker expression, COVID-19-related LDGs exhibit four different populations, which display distinctive stages of granulocytic development and most likely reflect emergency myelopoiesis. Moreover, COVID-19 LDGs show a link with an elevated recruitment and activation of neutrophils. Functional assays demonstrated the immunosuppressive capacities of these cells, which might contribute to impaired lymphocyte responses during acute disease. Taken together, our data confirms a significant granulocyte activation during COVID-19 and suggests that granulocytes of lower density play a role in disease progression.	Mechanism;Treatment
34131836	Returning to the Workplace During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Concerns of Australian Workers. Purpose To determine the nature and prevalence of workers' concerns regarding workplaces reopening during the pandemic. To identify characteristics of workers and industries where particular concerns are more common. Method Prospective cohort study of 1063 employed Australian adults, enrolled at the start of the pandemic. Data on attitudes to workplaces reopening were collected 1 July-30 September 2020. The frequency of concerns describes infection risk and changes to work and impact on home life. Regression models examined associations between demographic and industry factors with reopening concerns. Results More than four in five (82.4%) of workers reported concerns about workplace infection risk. Just over half (53.4%) reported concerns about impacts to work and home life. Concerns were more prevalent for workers reporting psychological distress, financial stress, and among those exclusively working from home. Concerns regarding infection risk were common for workers in health care (IRR 1.16, 95% CI [1.01, 1.33]), retail (IRR 1.31, 95% CI [1.06, 1.61]), and accommodation/food service industries (IRR 1.25, 95% CI [1.01, 1.55]). Concerns regarding changes to work and home life were more common for female workers (IRR 1.24, 95% CI [1.07, 1.43]), and partners/spouses with dependent children (IRR 1.44, 95% CI [1.16, 1.79]). Conclusion Concerns of COVID-19 infection in the workplace are common. Many workers are also concerned about changes to their work and home life. The prevalence of concerns is related to the nature of work and responsibilities at home. Actions that reduce risk of workplace transmission, coupled with effective communication of infection controls, may alleviate worker concerns whilst recognising workers' family and social circumstances.

34289153	Dengue fever outbreak in Cook Island: A rising concern, efforts, challenges, and future recommendations. The Cook Island government has made several efforts to ensure zero confirmed cases and transmission of COVID-19, especially among visiting travelers. However, the Cook Island ministry of health has to deal with the new strain of dengue fever outbreak, known as dengue fever type 2 (DEN-2), by adopting several measures to control its spread, especially in the affected parts of the subtropical country. This paper aims to describe the dengue fever response taken in Cook Island and suggest recommendations to control the risk of transmission in endemic parts of the world.	Prevention
34226855	The COVID-19 pandemic: Stay Home policy and exposure to risks of infection among Nigerians. The global threat which continues to accompany SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global response which adopts lockdown and stays home policy as means of curtailing its spread. This study investigates compliance with the Stay Home policy and exposure to COVID-19 in Nigeria. A survey was conducted from April 4 to May 8, 2020 using a cross-sectional mixed-methods approach to elicit responses from 879 participants across six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Descriptive, chi (2), and multiple regression tests were used to analyze survey data using SPSS, whereas NVivo v12 was used for thematic analysis of qualitative data. States with complete lockdown had 72.4% of respondents complying fully with the policy compared with 44.2% of respondents in zones with the partial lockdown. Market places, classified as high-risk zones, were the most visited (n = 505; 71.0%). Though compliance was influenced by the nature of lockdown enforced (chi (2) = 70.385, df = 2; p < 0.05), being a female, a widow, and unemployed were associated with increased compliance. Exposure to COVID-19 was associated with being married, unemployed, and having no income. Fear, anxiety, and misperception play major roles in compliance. The authors conclude that compliance is not uniform and a more nuanced and targeted approach is required as the government continues to respond to the COVID-19 global pandemic.	Prevention
34292212	"Antigen-based rapid diagnostic testing or alternatives for diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19: A simulation-based net benefit analysis. BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests can diagnose COVID-19 rapidly and at low cost, but lower sensitivity compared with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has limited clinical adoption. METHODS: We compared antigen testing, PCR testing, and clinical judgment alone for diagnosing symptomatic COVID-19 in an outpatient setting (10% COVID-19 prevalence among the patients tested, 3-day PCR turnaround) and a hospital setting (40% prevalence, 24-hour PCR turnaround). We simulated transmission from cases and contacts, and relationships between time, viral burden, transmission, and case detection. We compared diagnostic approaches using a measure of net benefit that incorporated both clinical and public health benefits and harms of intervention. RESULTS: In the outpatient setting, we estimated that using antigen testing instead of PCR to test 200 individuals could be equivalent to preventing all symptomatic transmission from one person with COVID-19 (one ""transmission-equivalent""). In a hospital, net benefit analysis favored PCR, and testing 25 patients with PCR instead of antigen testing achieved one transmission-equivalent of benefit. In both settings, antigen testing was preferable to PCR if PCR turnaround time exceeded 2 days. Both tests provided greater net benefit than management based on clinical judgment alone, unless intervention carried minimal harm and was provided equally regardless of diagnostic approach. CONCLUSIONS: For diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19, we estimated that speed of diagnosis with antigen testing is likely to outweigh its lower accuracy compared to PCR wherever PCR turnaround time is 2 days or longer. This advantage may be even greater if antigen tests are also less expensive."	Diagnosis
34222208	"Toward Smart Diagnostics in a Pandemic Scenario: COVID-19. The incredible spread rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has shocked the world. More than ever before, this dramatic scenario proved the significance of diagnostics as a cornerstone to make life-saving decisions. In this context, novel diagnostics that generates smart data leading to superior strategies for treatment, control, surveillance, prediction, prevention, and management of pandemic diseases is vital. Herein, we discuss the characteristics that should be met by COVID-19 diagnostics to become smart diagnostics enabled by industry 4.0 especially Internet of Things (IoT). The challenges ahead and our recommendations for moving faster from pure diagnostics toward smart diagnostics of COVID-19 and other possible epidemic/pandemic diseases are also outlined. An IoT-Fog-Cloud model based on smartphones as IoT gateways for smart diagnostics with unified strategies for data collection/transmission/interpretation is also proposed to integrate new digital technologies into a single platform for smarter decisions. Last but not least, we believe that ""smart diagnostics"" is a perspective that should be realized sooner before we encounter a pandemic far worse than the present one."	Diagnosis
34225645	Immune cell profiling and antibody responses in patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Although there are a growing number of studies on evaluating lymphocyte subset counts as prognostic factors for COVID-19 disease severity, the lymphocyte subsets' analyses of both IgM and IgG responders and non-responders during the periods after onset of symptoms, have not been conducted yet. So, this study aimed to evaluate immune cell profiling of COVID-19 patients with and without antibody responses. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the levels of peripheral lymphocyte subsets were measured using flow cytometry in 53 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, for whom antibody testing of COVID-19 was performed. RESULTS: The white blood cell, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts consistently decreased in the IgM and IgG non-responder group, while the differences in the median value between the two study groups were found to be statistically significant only in terms of neutrophil counts (P = 0.024 for IgM response and p-value = 0.046 for IgG response, respectively). Moreover, the level of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was observed to be significantly lower in the IgM or IgG non-responder group compared to the IgM or IgG responder group (3.6 +/- 3.1 vs. 6.3 +/- 4.2; p-value = 0.021). The patients with IgM antibody response had a significantly lower CD20(+) lymphocytes (11% versus 15% in the groups without IgM antibody response, p-value = 0.031), The percentages of NK cells and CD4(+) T cells significantly increased in the patients with IgG antibody response compared to those without IgG antibody response (13% versus 10%, p-value = 0.028, and 41.5% versus 34%; p-value = 0.03, respectively). Moreover, the patients who produced IgM or IgG antibody had significantly higher percentages of total T lymphocytes (64% versus 54%; p-value = 0.017), CD4(+) T cells (41% versus 34%; p-value = 0.038), and NK cells (13% versus 9%, p-value = 0.023) compared to the group with no serological response. No significant difference was observed in the percentage of other lymphocyte subsets, including CD8(+) T cells, Treg cells, and CD19(+) B cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the total T cells, CD4(+) T cells, and NK cells percentages are linked to serological response. Moreover, our findings suggested that neutrophil absolute counts and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio may be valuable predictors of IgM or IgG antibody response.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34282630	Peripheral and central smell regions in COVID-19 positive patients: an MRI evaluation. BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses may lead to invasion of the central nervous system. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of COVID-19 infection on smell using cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cranial MRI scans of 23 patients with COVID-19 (patient group [PG]) and 23 healthy controls (HCs) were evaluated. Peripheric (olfactory bulb [OB] volume and olfactory sulcus [OS] depth) and central (insular gyrus and corpus amygdala areas) smell regions were measured. RESULTS: Smell loss was present in nine patients (39.1%) in the PG. The means of the disease duration and antiviral treatment were 3.00 +/- 2.35 and 5.65 +/- 1.72 days, respectively. OB volumes of the PG were significantly lower than those of the HCs bilaterally. However, no significant differences were observed between the OS depth, insular gyrus, and corpus amygdala areas of both groups. The left corpus amygdala areas were both increased with the increased disease (P = 0.035, r = 0.442) and treatment durations (P = 0.037, r = 0.438). In the PG, longer treatment duration, increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte count decrease, and positive thoracic computed tomography (CT) involvement were related to OS depth decrease. Right corpus amygdala areas increased in patients with COVID-19 with increased D-dimer values, and thoracic CT involvement was detected. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 disease affects the peripheric smell region of OBs and does not affect the central smell regions of the insular gyrus and corpus amygdala areas. The importance of our study is to detect MRI findings in patients with COVID-19 leading to odor disorders. These findings may help in diagnosing the disease at an early stage.	Diagnosis
34292311	Assessment of Prostate Cancer Treatment Among Black and White Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Importance: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, racial/ethnic minority communities disproportionately experienced poor outcomes; however, the association of the pandemic with prostate cancer (PCa) care is unknown. Objective: To assess the association between race and PCa care delivery for Black and White patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, regional, collaborative, retrospective cohort study compared prostatectomy rates between Black and White patients with untreated nonmetastatic PCa during the COVID-19 pandemic (269 patients from March 16 to May 15, 2020) and prior (378 patients from March 11 to May 10, 2019). Main Outcomes and Measures: Prostatectomy rates. Results: Of the 647 men with nonmetastatic PCa, 172 (26.6%) were non-Hispanic Black men, and 475 (73.4%) were non-Hispanic White men. Black men were significantly less likely to undergo prostatectomy during the pandemic compared with White patients (1 of 76 [1.3%] vs 50 of 193 [25.9%]; P < .001), despite similar COVID-19 risk factors, biopsy Gleason grade groups, and comparable prostatectomy rates prior to the pandemic (17 of 96 [17.7%] vs 54 of 282 [19.1%]; P = .75). Black men had higher median prostate-specific antigen levels prior to biopsy (8.8 ng/mL [interquartile range, 5.3-15.2 ng/mL] vs 7.2 ng/mL [interquartile range, 5.1-11.1 ng/mL]; P = .04). A linear combination of regression coefficients with an interaction term for year demonstrated an odds ratio for likelihood of surgery of 0.06 (95% CI, 0.01-0.35; P = .002) for Black patients and 1.41 (95% CI, 0.81-2.44; P = .23) for White patients during the pandemic compared with prior to the pandemic. Changes in surgical volume varied by site (from a 33% increase to complete shutdown), with sites that experienced the largest reduction in cancer surgery caring for a greater proportion of Black patients. Conclusions and Relevance: In this large multi-institutional regional collaborative cohort study, the odds of PCa surgery were lower among Black patients compared with White patients during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although localized PCa does not require immediate treatment, the lessons from this study suggest systemic inequities within health care and are likely applicable across medical specialties. Public health efforts are needed to fully recognize the unintended consequence of diversion of cancer resources to the COVID-19 pandemic to develop balanced mitigation strategies as viral rates continue to fluctuate.

34209229	Evolution of Nutritional Status after Early Nutritional Management in COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients. Background & Aims: SARS-CoV2 infection is associated with an increased risk of malnutrition. Although there are numerous screening and nutritional management protocols for malnutrition, only few studies have reported nutritional evolution after COVID-19. The objectives of this study were to describe the evolution of nutritional parameters between admission and 30 days after hospital discharge, and to determine predictive factors of poor nutritional outcome after recovery in adult COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this observational longitudinal study, we report findings after discharge in 91 out of 114 patients initially admitted for COVID-19 who received early nutritional management. Nutritional status was defined using GLIM criteria and compared between admission and day 30 after discharge. Baseline predictors of nutritional status at day 30 were assessed using logistic regression. Results: Thirty days after discharge, 28.6% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were malnourished, compared to 42.3% at admission. Half of malnourished patients (53%) at admission recovered a normal nutritional status after discharge. Weight trajectories were heterogeneous and differed if patients had been transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) during hospitalization (p = 0.025). High oxygen requirement during hospitalization (invasive ventilation p = 0.016 (OR 8.3 [1.6-61.2]) and/or oxygen therapy over 5 L/min p = 0.021 (OR 3.2 [1.2-8.9]) were strong predictors of malnutrition one month after discharge. Conclusions: With early nutritional management, most patients hospitalized for COVID-19 improved nutritional parameters after discharge. These findings emphasize the importance of nutritional care in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in medicine departments, especially in those transferred from ICU.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34229173	Re-Du-Ning injection ameliorates LPS-induced lung injury through inhibiting neutrophil extracellular traps formation. BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are life-threatening diseases and could occur in severe COVID-19 patients. Re-Du-Ning injection (RDN) is a tradition Chinese medicine preparation which has been clinically used for treatment of respiratory diseases including COVID-19. PURPOSE: To elucidate the potential mechanisms of RDN for the treatment of ALI. METHODS: Female C57BL/6J mice were used to establish ALI model by intraperitoneal injection 10 mg/kg LPS, and RDN injection was intraperitoneally administered with the dose of 5 and 10 ml/kg. The cytokines were measured by ELISA and qPCR. The data related to NETs were analyzed by ELISA, immunofluorescence, Western blotting and network pharmacological approach. RESULTS: RDN robustly alleviated LPS-induced ALI. Meanwhile, RDN downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Specifically, RDN treatment inhibited the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and remarkably suppressed the protein of PAD4. The active compound from RDN decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that RDN ameliorates LPS-induced ALI through suppressing MAPK pathway to inhibit the formation of NETs.	Mechanism;Treatment
34228902	Identification of a special cell type as a determinant of the kidney tropism of SARS-CoV-2. The kidney tropism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been well-validated clinically and often leads to various forms of renal damage in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, the underlying mechanisms and diagnostic approaches remain to be determined. We interrogated the expression of virus-related host factors in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets of normal human kidneys and kidneys with pre-existing diseases and validated the results with urinary proteomics of COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals. We also assessed the effects of genetic variants on kidney susceptibility using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) databases. We identified a subtype of tubular cells, which we named PT-3 cells, as being vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infections in the kidneys. PT-3 cells were enriched in viral entry factors and replication and assembly machinery but lacked antiviral restriction factors. Immunohistochemistry confirmed positive staining of PT-3 cell marker SCL36A2 on kidney sections from COVID-19 patients. Urinary proteomic analyses of COVID-19 patients revealed that markers of PT-3 cells were significantly increased, along with elevated viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. We further found that the proportion of PT-3 cells increased in diabetic nephropathy but decreased in kidney allografts and lupus nephropathy, suggesting that kidney susceptibility varied among these diseases. We finally identified several eQTLs that regulate the expression of host factors in kidney cells. PT-3 cells may represent a key determinant for the kidney tropism of SARS-CoV-2, and detection of PT-3 cells may be used to assess the risk of renal infection during COVID-19.	Mechanism;Diagnosis
34284156	The Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic on Neurosurgical Practice and Feasibility of Safe Resumption of Elective Procedures During this Era in a Large Referral Center in Tehran, Iran: An Unmatched Case-Control Study. OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has considerably affected surgical practice. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the pandemic on neurosurgical practice and the safety of the resumption of elective procedures through implementing screening protocols in a high-volume academic public center in Iran, as one of the countries severely affected by the pandemic. METHODS: This unmatched case-control study compared 2 populations of patients who underwent neurosurgical procedures between June 1, 2019 and September 1, 2019 and the same period in 2020. In the prospective part of the study, patients who underwent elective procedures were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection postoperatively to evaluate the viability of our screening protocol. RESULTS: Elective and emergency procedures showed significant reduction during the pandemic (59.4%, n = 168 vs. 71.3%, n = 380) and increase (28.7%, n = 153 vs. 40.6%, n = 115, respectively; P = 0.003). The proportional distribution of neurosurgical categories remained unchanged during the pandemic. Poisson regression showed that the reduction in total daily admissions and some categories, including spine, trauma, oncology, and infection were significantly correlated with the pandemic. Among patients who underwent elective procedures, 0 (0.0%) and 26 (16.25%) had positive test results on days 30 and 60 postoperatively, respectively. Overall mortality was comparable between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, yet patients with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection showed substantially higher mortality (65%). CONCLUSIONS: By implementing safety and screening protocols with proper resource allocation, the emergency care capacity can be maintained and the risk minimized of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, complications, and mortality among neurosurgical patients during the pandemic. Similarly, for elective procedures, according to available resources, hospital beds can be allocated for patients with a higher risk of delayed hospitalization and those who are concerned about the risk of hospital-acquired infection can be reassured.

34351895	Modelling conformational state dynamics and its role on infection for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variants. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein needs to be in an open-state conformation to interact with ACE2 to initiate viral entry. We utilise coarse-grained normal mode analysis to model the dynamics of Spike and calculate transition probabilities between states for 17081 variants including experimentally observed variants. Our results correctly model an increase in open-state occupancy for the more infectious D614G via an increase in flexibility of the closed-state and decrease of flexibility of the open-state. We predict the same effect for several mutations on glycine residues (404, 416, 504, 252) as well as residues K417, D467 and N501, including the N501Y mutation recently observed within the B.1.1.7, 501.V2 and P1 strains. This is, to our knowledge, the first use of normal mode analysis to model conformational state transitions and the effect of mutations on such transitions. The specific mutations of Spike identified here may guide future studies to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and guide public health in their surveillance efforts.

34207174	Modeling Provincial Covid-19 Epidemic Data Using an Adjusted Time-Dependent SIRD Model. In this paper, we develop a forecasting model for the spread of COVID-19 infection at a provincial (i.e., EU NUTS-3) level in Italy by using official data from the Italian Ministry of Health integrated with data extracted from daily official press conferences of regional authorities and local newspaper websites. This data integration is needed as COVID-19 death data are not available at the NUTS-3 level from official open data channels. An adjusted time-dependent SIRD model is used to predict the behavior of the epidemic; specifically, the number of susceptible, infected, deceased, recovered people and epidemiological parameters. Predictive model performance is evaluated using comparison with real data.	Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34224708	CO2 concentration monitoring inside educational buildings as a strategic tool to reduce the risk of Sars-CoV-2 airborne transmission. In order to avoid SARS-CoV-2 transmission inside educational buildings and promote the safe reopening of schools, the Italian Government, in line with the other European countries and in accordance with the WHO recommendations, adopted a contingency plan including actions able to guarantee adequate air ventilation in classrooms. Therefore, in this pilot study, a surveillance activity based on the real-time monitoring of CO2 levels as a proxy of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk, was conducted inside 9 schools (11 classrooms) located in Apulia Region (South of Italy) during the reopening of schools after the lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, monitoring activities and data treatment were conducted to evaluate the initial scenario inside the classrooms (first stage of evaluation) and the potential improvements obtained by applying a detailed operating protocol of air ventilation based on specific actions and the simultaneous real time visualization of CO2 levels by non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors (second stage of evaluation). Although, during the first evaluation stage, air ventilation through the opening of windows and doors was guaranteed, 6 (54%) classrooms showed mean values of CO2 higher than 1000 ppm and all classrooms exceeded the recommended CO2 concentration limit value of 700 ppm. The development and implementation of tailored ventilation protocol including the real time visualization of CO2 levels allowed to depict better scenariosAn overall improvement of CO2 levels was indeed registered for all classrooms where teachers were compliant and helpful in the management of the air ventilation strategy. Therefore, this study reports the first evidence-based measures demonstrating that, with the exception of few environments affected by structural limits, the real-time visualization and monitoring of CO2 concentrations allowes effective air exchanges to be implemented and contributes to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Moreover, on the basis of the monitoring outcomes and in order to ensure adequate air ventilation in educational buildings, a 4 level-risk classification including specific corrective actions for each level was provided.

34220186	The adaptive capacity of public space under COVID-19: Exploring urban design interventions through a sociotechnical systems approach. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a dramatic impact on the way in which the community interacts within public spaces. Consequently, the design of these urban environments requires new approaches. It is our view that Human Factors and Ergonomics approaches can be used to provide these insights. This article explores the opportunities for making public spaces safer and more accessible for community use under pandemic conditions. The study utilizes a sociotechnical systems model of an archetype public space, developed pre-COVID-19, to explore the infrastructure and activities that are impacted by the introduction of the virus to the public space system. The aim was to identify those elements of the system that are completely unavailable under pandemic conditions, those elements that become limited in use, and those which remained unaffected by the presence of the virus. The findings show that under pandemic conditions pre-COVID-19 public spaces were surprisingly resilient with proportionally few elements within the model completely unavailable. They also demonstrate that overall, the public spaces system, while still operating, is significantly constrained in achieving and optimizing community and individual health and well-being. The insertion of five (5) urban design interventions within the system model presented unique insights into the possibilities for optimizing adaptive capacity. These interventions revealed design opportunities across several levels of the systems model. Such insights are argued to assist in not only re-establishing community access under pandemic conditions but also more inclusive access to a broader range of the community under all conditions.

34131784	"Safety of biologics in inflammatory bowel disease patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Patients with Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain highly concerned that either their disease or medications-namely, biologics-may increase the risk of severe coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to assess the safety of biologics in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically reviewed multiple databases to find relevant articles reporting the effect of biologics on ""severe"" COVID-19 in IBD patients. Those in the form of case series (> 10 patients), case-control, and cohort studies were included. Severe COVID-19 was defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and/or mortality. Pooled analysis with multivariate regression was performed. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies with 2681 patients were included. The proportion of females was (48.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 47.0-49.5%). The proportion of UC patients was (44.8%, 95% CI 41.0-48.5%). Overall, in IBD patients, the need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality was 5.1%, 6.1%, and 4.5%, respectively. Use of biologics did not show a moderating effect on mechanical ventilation (p = 0.68), ICU admission (p = 0.27), or mortality (p = 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings advocate for the continued biologic therapy in IBD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the incidence, severity, and outcomes related to COVID-19 in IBD patients' needs to be reassessed as data continues to emerge."	Treatment
34226771	COVID-19 and Motivated Reasoning: The Influence of Knowledge on COVID-Related Policy and Health Behavior. Objective: The spread of misinformation about COVID-19 severely influences the governments' ability to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This study explores the predictors of accurate beliefs about COVID-19 and its influence on COVID-related policy and behavior. Methods: Data from an original survey collected by Lucid in July 2020 are used. Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS) is used to predict accurate beliefs about COVID-19. Ordered logistic regression models are estimated to examine the relationship between COVID-19 knowledge, policy preferences, and health behavior intentions. Results: Ideology and education were found to have a positive effect on knowledge about COVID-19. Moreover, low levels of knowledge about COVID-19 were found to reduce support for mandatory vaccination policy and willingness to get a coronavirus vaccine when available. Conclusion: These findings will help policymakers develop communication strategies for the public on the coronavirus vaccination.	Prevention
34288674	Self-Masked Aldehyde Inhibitors: A Novel Strategy for Inhibiting Cysteine Proteases. Cysteine proteases comprise an important class of drug targets, especially for infectious diseases such as Chagas disease (cruzain) and COVID-19 (3CL protease, cathepsin L). Peptide aldehydes have proven to be potent inhibitors for all of these proteases. However, the intrinsic, high electrophilicity of the aldehyde group is associated with safety concerns and metabolic instability, limiting the use of aldehyde inhibitors as drugs. We have developed a novel class of self-masked aldehyde inhibitors (SMAIs) for cruzain, the major cysteine protease of the causative agent of Chagas disease-Trypanosoma cruzi. These SMAIs exerted potent, reversible inhibition of cruzain (Ki* = 18-350 nM) while apparently protecting the free aldehyde in cell-based assays. We synthesized prodrugs of the SMAIs that could potentially improve their pharmacokinetic properties. We also elucidated the kinetic and chemical mechanism of SMAIs and applied this strategy to the design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.	Mechanism;Treatment
34133812	The effects of orally administered lactoferrin in the prevention and management of viral infections: A systematic review. It has been demonstrated that lactoferrin (LF) plays a role in host defence, but evidence on its potential antiviral property from clinical studies is fragmented. Our systematic review aimed at identifying the effects of orally administered LF against virus infections. The systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, BioRxiv.org and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception to 7th January 2021. Eligible articles investigated any virus family and provided data on the effects of orally administered LF of any origin in the prevention and/or management of confirmed viral infections in people of any age. A narrative synthesis of the results was performed. Quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk-Of-Bias and ROBINS-1 tools. A total of 27 records were included, nine of which were registered protocols. We found data on Flaviviridae (n = 10), Retroviridae (n = 3), Coronaviridae (n = 2), Reoviridae (n = 2) and Caliciviridae (n = 1). Most published trials were at high risk of bias. The findings were heterogeneous across and within viral families regarding virological, immunological and biological response, with no clear conclusion. Some weak but positive results were reported about decrease of symptom severity and duration, or reduction in viral loads. Despite high tolerability, the effects of LF as oral supplement are still inconsistent, both in preventing and managing viral infections. Small sample sizes, variety in recruitment and treatment protocols, and low study quality may have contributed to such heterogeneity. Better-designed studies are needed to further investigate its potential benefits against viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.	Treatment
34340930	The influence of pre-admission antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy on the illness severity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Japan. INTRODUCTION: Many articles have reported that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes coagulation abnormalities and pulmonary thrombosis, contributing to a poorer prognosis. The study aimed to evaluate whether pre-admission anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy prevented severe COVID-19 illness or not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether taking antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents before admission affected the severity on admission using a large nationwide cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Japan. We analyzed a large nationwide cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Japan from February 9 to July 31, 2020. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 4265 patients from 342 facilities in Japan were included. Their use was associated with a slight reduction in the disease severity on admission in a propensity score-matched analysis which controlled for underlying diseases. However, this difference was not statistically significant.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34228725	"SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies: Longevity, breadth, and evasion by emerging viral variants. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody neutralization response and its evasion by emerging viral variants and variant of concern (VOC) are unknown, but critical to understand reinfection risk and breakthrough infection following vaccination. Antibody immunoreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens and Spike variants, inhibition of Spike-driven virus-cell fusion, and infectious SARS-CoV-2 neutralization were characterized in 807 serial samples from 233 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) individuals with detailed demographics and followed up to 7 months. A broad and sustained polyantigenic immunoreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid proteins, along with high viral neutralization, was associated with COVID-19 severity. A subgroup of ""high responders"" maintained high neutralizing responses over time, representing ideal convalescent plasma donors. Antibodies generated against SARS-CoV-2 during the first COVID-19 wave had reduced immunoreactivity and neutralization potency to emerging Spike variants and VOC. Accurate monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses would be essential for selection of optimal responders and vaccine monitoring and design."	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Treatment
34351998	Prolonged detection of complete viral genomes demonstrated by SARS-CoV-2 sequencing of serial respiratory specimens. Accurate and timely diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is clinically essential, and is required also to monitor confirmed cases aiming to prevent further spread. Positive real-time PCR results at late time points following initial diagnosis may be clinically misleading as this methodology cannot account for the infection capabilities and the existence of whole genome sequences. In this study, 47 serial respiratory samples were tested by Allplex-nCoV test (Seegene), a triplex of three assays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP, E and N genes and subsequently assessed by next generation sequencing (NGS). COVID19 patients were tested at an early stage of the disease, when all these viral gene targets were positive, and at an advanced stage, when only the N gene target was positive in the Allplex-nCoV test. The corresponding NGS results showed the presence of complete viral genome copies at both early and advanced stages of the disease, although the total number of mapped sequences was lower in samples from advanced disease stages. We conclude that reduced viral transmission at this late disease stage may result from the low quantities of complete viral sequences and not solely from transcription favoring the N gene.

34227728	'They're getting a taste of our world': A qualitative study of people with multiple sclerosis' experiences of accessing health care during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Australian Capital Territory. BACKGROUND: People with multiple sclerosis (MS), who are often immunocompromised, require complex care and engage with a variety of health-care providers to manage their health. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate people with MS' experiences of accessing health care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. DESIGN: A qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Eight adults with a clinical diagnosis of MS participated in telephone or video call interviews between June and July 2020. RESULTS: Participants were aware that having MS made them more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19. In some cases, usual care was postponed or not sought. Some circumstances warranted the risk of a face-to-face consultation. Benefits of telehealth consultations included improved access, convenience and being contact-free. In comparison with video consultations, those via telephone were considered less personal and limited capacity to read body language, and for physical examination. Most participants hoped to incorporate telehealth into their future health-care routines. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Personal risk assessment and trust in health-care professionals are determinants of the mode through which people with MS accessed health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth has been a valuable tool to mitigate COVID-19 transmission through enabling contact-free consultations. People with MS may find specific value in video consultations, which enable visualization of physical function. There is a need for training and support for all clinicians to conduct remote consultations. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This study was conducted by a team comprised of four people with MS, a neurologist and four health services researchers.	Prevention
34215866	Disparities among Racially/Ethnically Marginalized Groups in the COVID-19 Pandemic Persist Regardless of Statewide Shelter-in-Place Policies: An Analysis from Northern California. To measure COVID-19 disparities among racial/ethnically marginalized groups in hospitalization and ICU (Intensive Care Unit)-transfer pre/post implementation of the California statewide shelter-in-place (SIP) policy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a healthcare system in California. COVID-19 patients from 1/1/20-8/31/20 were identified from electronic health records. We examined hospitalizations and ICU transfers by race/ethnicity and pandemic period using logistic regression. Among 16,520 people with COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 46.6 [18.4] years; 54.2% women); during the Post-SIP period, patients were on average younger and a larger proportion were Hispanic. In adjusted models, odds of hospitalization were 20% lower post-SIP compared to SIP, yet all non-White groups had higher odds (ORs 1.6-2.1) compared to Non-Hispanic White, regardless of period. Among hospitalized patients, odds of ICU transfer were 33% lower post-SIP versus SIP. Hispanic and Asian patients had higher odds compared to Non-Hispanic. Disparities in hospitalization persisted while ICU risk became more pronounced for Asian and Hispanic patients in post-SIP. Policy makers should consider ways to proactively address inequities in risk when considering future population-level policy interventions for public health crises.	Prevention
34204754	Previous SARS-CoV-2 Infection Increases B.1.1.7 Cross-Neutralization by Vaccinated Individuals. With the spread of new variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is a need to assess the protection conferred by both previous infections and current vaccination. Here we tested the neutralizing activity of infected and/or vaccinated individuals against pseudoviruses expressing the spike of the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (WH1), the D614G mutant and the B.1.1.7 variant. Our data show that parameters of natural infection (time from infection and nature of the infecting variant) determined cross-neutralization. Uninfected vaccinees showed a small reduction in neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant compared to both the WH1 strain and the D614G mutant. Interestingly, upon vaccination, previously infected individuals developed more robust neutralizing responses against B.1.1.7, suggesting that vaccines can boost the neutralization breadth conferred by natural infection.

34202825	Musculoskeletal Disorders, Pain Medication, and in-Hospital Mortality among Patients with COVID-19 in South Korea: A Population-Based Cohort Study. We aimed to investigate whether comorbid musculoskeletal disorders (MSD)s and pain medication use was associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Adult patients (>/=20 years old) with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis until 5 June 2020 were included in this study, based on the National Health Insurance COVID-19 database in South Korea. MSDs included osteoarthritis, neck pain, lower back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and others, while pain medication included paracetamol, gabapentin, pregabalin, glucocorticoid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids (strong and weak opioids), and benzodiazepine. Primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. A total of 7713 patients with COVID-19 were included, and in-hospital mortality was observed in 248 (3.2%) patients. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, no MSDs (p > 0.05) were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. However, in-hospital mortality was 12.73 times higher in users of strong opioids (odds ratio: 12.73, 95% confidence interval: 2.44-16.64; p = 0.002), while use of paracetamol (p = 0.973), gabapentin or pregabalin (p = 0.424), glucocorticoid (p = 0.673), NSAIDs (p = 0.979), weak opioids (p = 0.876), and benzodiazepine (p = 0.324) was not associated with in-hospital mortality. In South Korea, underlying MSDs were not associated with increased in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19. However, use of strong opioids was significantly associated with increased in-hospital mortality among the patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34208470	COVID-19 and Delayed Cerebral Ischemia-More in Common Than First Meets the Eye. Since the arrival of the global COVID-19 pandemic scientists around the world have been working to understand the pathological mechanisms resulting from infection. There has gradually been an understanding that COVID-19 triggers a widespread endotheliopathy and that this can result in a widespread thrombosis and in particular a microthrombosis. The mechanisms involved in the microthrombosis are not confined to infection and there is evidence that patients with aneurysmal sub-arachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) also suffer from an endotheliopathy and microthrombosis. In this article we attempt to shed light on similarities in the underlying processes involved in both diseases and suggest potential treatment options.	Mechanism;Treatment
34336365	Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine does not influence the profile of prothrombotic antibody nor increase the risk of thrombosis in a prospective Chinese cohort. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies was shown to be associated with thrombosis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Recently, according to reports from several studies, the vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia is mediated by anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanion complex in adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine recipients. It is impendent to explore whether inactivated COVID-19 vaccine widely used in China influences prothrombotic autoantibody production and induces thrombosis. In this prospective study, we recruited 406 healthcare workers who received two doses, 21 days apart, of inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (BBIBP-CorV, Sinopharm). Paired blood samples taken before vaccination and four weeks after the second vaccination were used in detecting prothrombotic autoantibodies, including anticardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2 glycoprotein I (abeta2GP1), anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT), and anti-PF4-heparin. The seroconversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies was 95.81% (389/406) four weeks after vaccination. None of the subjects had spontaneous thrombosis or thrombocytopenia over a minimum follow-up period of eight weeks. There was no significant difference in the presence of all ten autoantibodies between samples collected before and after vaccination: for aCL, IgG (7 vs. 8, P = 0.76), IgM (41 vs. 44, P = 0.73), IgA (4 vs. 4, P = 1.00); anti-beta2GP1, IgG (7 vs. 6, P = 0.78), IgM (6 vs. 5, P = 0.76), IgA (3 vs. 5, P = 0.72); aPS/PT IgG (0 vs. 0, P = 1.00), IgM (6 vs. 5, P = 0.76); aPF4-heparin (2 vs. 7, P = 0.18), and antinuclear antibody (ANA) (18 vs. 21, P = 0.62). Notably, seven cases presented with anti-PF4-heparin antibodies (range: 1.18-1.79 U/mL) after vaccination, and none of them exhibited any sign of thrombotic disorder. In conclusion, inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine does not influence the profile of antiphospholipid antibody and anti-PF4-heparin antibody nor increase the risk of thrombosis.	Treatment
34217412	The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on breast cancer early detection and screening. The COVID-19 pandemic affects mortality and morbidity, with disruptions expected to continue for some time, with access to timely cancer-related services a concern. For breast cancer, early detection and treatment is key to improved survival and longer-term quality of life. Health services generally have been strained and in many settings with population breast mammography screening, efforts to diagnose and treat breast cancers earlier have been paused or have had reduced capacity. The resulting delays to diagnosis and treatment may lead to more intensive treatment requirements and, potentially, increased mortality. Modelled evaluations can support responses to the pandemic by estimating short- and long-term outcomes for various scenarios. Multiple calibrated and validated models exist for breast cancer screening, and some have been applied in 2020 to estimate the impact of breast screening disruptions and compare options for recovery, in a range of international settings. On behalf of the Covid and Cancer Modelling Consortium (CCGMC) Working Group 2 (Breast Cancer), we summarize and provide examples of such in a range of settings internationally, and propose priorities for future modelling exercises. International expert collaborations from the CCGMC Working Group 2 (Breast Cancer) will conduct analyses and modelling studies needed to inform key stakeholders recovery efforts in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

34226066	Prevalence of Anosmia or Ageusia in Patients With COVID-19 Among United Arab Emirates Population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research was to determine the relationship and prevalence of taste and smell dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) population. METHODS: Enrolled participants were interviewed online via a phone call after obtaining their informed consent. Quantification of smell, taste, and other sensations before, during, and after COVID-19 infection was correlated with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 500 patients with (mild-severe) COVID-19 completed the survey. A total of 26.4% were asymptomatic, and 21.4% were classified as paucisymptomatic with less severe symptoms. Almost equal proportions of the studied population experienced extreme taste sensation reductions (43%) and loss of smell sensation (44%). Statistically significant drastic decreases in smell and taste senses were seen among younger individuals. The magnitude of reduction in both sense changes increased steeply from the asymptomatic group to the paucisymptomatic group to the symptomatic group. CONCLUSIONS: Sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognised for early detection of COVID-19 infection to identify otherwise hidden carriers, thus favoring an early isolation strategy that will restrict the spread of the disease.

34202815	Nanotechnology as a Shield against COVID-19: Current Advancement and Limitations. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health problem that the WHO declared a pandemic. COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide lockdown and threatened to topple the global economy. The mortality of COVID-19 is comparatively low compared with previous SARS outbreaks, but the rate of spread of the disease and its morbidity is alarming. This virus can be transmitted human-to-human through droplets and close contact, and people of all ages are susceptible to this virus. With the advancements in nanotechnology, their remarkable properties, including their ability to amplify signal, can be used for the development of nanobiosensors and nanoimaging techniques that can be used for early-stage detection along with other diagnostic tools. Nano-based protection equipment and disinfecting agents can provide much-needed protection against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, nanoparticles can serve as a carrier for antigens or as an adjuvant, thereby making way for the development of a new generation of vaccines. The present review elaborates the role of nanotechnology-based tactics used for the detection, diagnosis, protection, and treatment of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34220204	Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children and Adolescents (MIS-C) under the Setting of COVID-19: A Review of Clinical Presentation, Workup and Management. Earlier in its course, SARS-CoV-2 was primarily identified to cause an acute respiratory illness in adults, the elderly and immunocompromised, while children were known to be afflicted with milder symptoms. However, since mid-April of 2020, latent effects of the virus have begun emerging in children and adolescents, which is characterised by a multisystem hyperinflammatory state; thus, the term Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) was introduced by the WHO and CDC. The syndrome manifests itself approximately 4 weeks after COVID-19 infection, with symptoms mimicking Kawasaki Disease and Kawasaki Disease Shock Syndrome. Demographically, MIS-C peaks in children aged 5 to 14 years, with clusters in Europe, North and Latin America seen, later followed by Asia. Although the exact pathophysiology behind the syndrome is unknown, recent studies have proposed a post-infectious immune aetiology, which explains the increased levels of immunoglobulins seen in affected patients. Patient presentation includes, but is not limited to, persistent fever, rash, gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiac complications including myocarditis. These patients also have raised inflammatory markers including C reactive protein, ferritin and interleukin-6. In poorly controlled patients, the syndrome can lead to multiorgan failure and death. The mainstay of treatment includes the use of intravenous immunoglobulins, steroids, immune modulators and aspirin. Adjunct therapy includes the use of low molecular weight heparin or warfarin for long term anticoagulation. Currently very little is known about the syndrome, highlighting the need for awareness amongst healthcare workers and parents. Moreover, with increased cases of COVID-19 as a result of the second wave, it is essential to keep MIS-C in mind when attending patients with a past history of COVID-19 exposure or infection. Additionally, once these patients have been identified and treated, strict follow-up must be done in order carry out long term studies, and to identify possible sequelae and complications.

34225084	Management of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in intensive care unit: An observational retrospective study comparing two bundles. PURPOSE: To compare the effects of two therapeutic bundles of management in SARS-CoV2 ICU patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective, observational study was performed in a university ICU from March to June 2020 (first wave) and from September 2020 to January 2021 (second wave). In first wave, patients received bundle 1 including early invasive ventilation, hydroxychloroquine, cefotaxime and azithromycin. In second wave, bundle 2 included non-invasive oxygenation support and dexamethasone. The main outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay, ICU supportive therapies, viral clearance and antimicrobial resistance emergence. RESULTS: 129 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were admitted to our ICU. Thirty-five were treated according to bundle 1 and 76 to bundle 2. In-hospital mortality was similar in the two groups (23%, p = 1). The hospital (p = 0.003) and ICU (p = 0.01) length of stay and ventilator-free days at 28 days (p = 0.03) were significantly reduced in bundle 2. Increasing age, vasopressor use and PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 125 were associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of our study, changes in therapeutic bundles for SARS-Cov-2 ICU patients might have no effect on in-hospital mortality but were associated with less exposure to mechanical ventilation and reduced hospital length of stay.

34335247	Potential Mechanisms of Action of Chinese Patent Medicines for COVID-19: A Review. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emergent infectious pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is highly contagious and pathogenic. COVID-19 has rapidly swept across the world since it was first discovered in December 2019 and has drawn significant attention worldwide. During the early stages of the outbreak in China, traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) were involved in the whole treatment process. As an indispensable part of TCM, Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) played an irreplaceable role in the prevention and treatment of this epidemic. Their use has achieved remarkable therapeutic efficacy during the period of medical observation and clinical treatment of mild, moderate, severe, and critical cases and during convalescence. In order to better propagate and make full use of the benefits of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19, this review will summarize the potential target of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the theoretical basis and clinical efficacy of recommended 22 CPMs by the National Health Commission and the Administration of TCM and local provinces or cities in the treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, the study will further analyze the drug composition, potential active ingredients, potential targets, regulated signaling pathways, and possible mechanisms for COVID-19 through anti-inflammatory and immunoregulation, antiviral, improve lung injury, antipyretic and organ protection to provide meaningful information about the clinical application of CPMs.	Mechanism;Treatment
34211702	Other ways of communicating the pandemic - memes and stickers against COVID-19: a systematic review. Background: In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there are many ways to communicate hygiene measures, such as memes and stickers that are widely used on social networks. We carried out a systematic review in order to determine the impact of stickers and memes as tools to face the COVID-19 pandemic, following the PRISMA guide. Methods: The search was carried out in scientific databases (MEDLINE / PubMed, ScientiDirect, Scielo, LILACS, and Latindex), and in public pre-publication servers (bioRxiv, SocArXiv, medRxiv and Preprints). The publications were identified using the terms (((meme) OR (sticker)) AND ((COVID-19) OR (SARS-COV-2)) AND (WhatsApp)) and the corresponding translations for Spanish and Portuguese. Results: In the initial search, 8434 studies were obtained, 7749 in Preprints, 446 in SocArXiv, 145 in ScientDirect, 82 in medRxiv, and 12 in PubMed. No studies were found in LILACS, Latindex, Scielo, or bioRxiv. Of the 51 studies included as eligible, all were eliminated for not meeting the study inclusion criteria. The majority (40 studies) were eliminated as studies were publications related to the social aspects related to COVID-19, but did not develop an analysis of stickers or memes. Conclusions: No studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria related to the role of stickers and memes as tools to face the COVID-19 pandemic. More studies are needed to estimate its role as a means of communication in health.	Prevention
34206274	Remdesivir MD Simulations Suggest a More Favourable Binding to SARS-CoV-2 RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase Mutant P323L Than Wild-Type. SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein is the target for the antiviral drug Remdesivir (RDV). With RDV clinical trials on COVID-19 patients showing a reduced hospitalisation time. During the spread of the virus, the RdRp has developed several mutations, with the most frequent being A97V and P323L. The current study sought to investigate whether A97V and P323L mutations influence the binding of RDV to the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 compared to wild-type (WT). The interaction of RDV with WT-, A97V-, and P323L-RdRp were measured using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and the free binding energies were extracted. Results showed that RDV that bound to WT- and A97V-RdRp had a similar dynamic motion and internal residue fluctuations, whereas RDV interaction with P323L-RdRp exhibited a tighter molecular conformation, with a high internal motion near the active site. This was further corroborated with RDV showing a higher binding affinity to P323L-RdRp (-24.1 kcal/mol) in comparison to WT-RdRp (-17.3 kcal/mol). This study provides insight into the potential significance of administering RDV to patients carrying the SARS-CoV-2 P323L-RdRp mutation, which may have a more favourable chance of alleviating the SARS-CoV-2 illness in comparison to WT-RdRp carriers, thereby suggesting further scientific consensus for the usage of Remdesivir as clinical candidate against COVID-19.

34372552	The SARS-CoV-2/Receptor Axis in Heart and Blood Vessels: A Crisp Update on COVID-19 Disease with Cardiovascular Complications. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causing COVID-19 disease has emerged expeditiously in the world and has been declared pandemic since March 2020, by World Health Organization (WHO). The destructive effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection are increased among the patients with pre-existing chronic conditions and, in particular, this review focuses on patients with underlying cardiovascular complications. The expression pattern and potential functions of SARS-CoV-2 binding receptors and the attributes of SARS-CoV-2 virus tropism in a physio-pathological state of heart and blood vessel are precisely described. Of note, the atheroprotective role of ACE2 receptors is reviewed. A detailed description of the possible detrimental role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in terms of vascular leakage, including endothelial glycocalyx dysfunction and bradykinin 1 receptor stimulation is concisely stated. Furthermore, the potential molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 induced clot formation in association with host defense components, including activation of FXIIa, complements and platelets, endothelial dysfunction, immune cell responses with cytokine-mediated action are well elaborated. Moreover, a brief clinical update on patient with COVID-19 disease with underlying cardiovascular complications and those who had new onset of cardiovascular complications post-COVID-19 disease was also discussed. Taken together, this review provides an overview of the mechanistic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 induced devastating effects, in vital organs such as the heart and vessels.	Mechanism;Treatment
34284634	Improving pandemic mitigation policies across communities through coupled dynamics of risk perception and infection. Capturing the coupled dynamics between individual behavioural decisions that affect disease transmission and the epidemiology of outbreaks is critical to pandemic mitigation strategy. We develop a multiplex network approach to model how adherence to health-protective behaviours that impact COVID-19 spread are shaped by perceived risks and resulting community norms. We focus on three synergistic dynamics governing individual behavioural choices: (i) social construction of concern, (ii) awareness of disease incidence, and (iii) reassurance by lack of disease. We show why policies enacted early or broadly can cause communities to become reassured and therefore unwilling to maintain or adopt actions. Public health policies for which success relies on collective action should therefore exploit the behaviourally receptive phase; the period between the generation of sufficient concern to foster adoption of novel actions and the relaxation of adherence driven by reassurance fostered by avoidance of negative outcomes over time.

34221178	SARS-CoV-2 and Plasma Hypercoagulability. Hypercoagulability has emerged as a prominent consequence of COVID-19. This presents challenges not only in the clinic, but also in thrombosis research. Health and safety considerations, the status of the blood and plasma supply, the infection status of individual donors, and the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 activates coagulation are all of concern. In this review, we discuss these topics from the basic research perspective. As in other respiratory illnesses, blood and plasma from COVID-19 positive patients carries minimal to no risk of infection to practitioners or researchers. There are currently no special regulatory mandates directing individual donors (for research purposes), blood centers/services or vendors (for blood products for research) to test blood/plasma for SARS-CoV-2 or antibodies. We discuss current theories about how SARS-CoV-2 leads to hyper-coagulant state in severe cases of COVID-19. Our current understanding of the mechanisms behind COVID-19 associated thromboembolic events have centered around three different pathways: (1) direct activation of platelets, enhancing coagulation; (2) direct infection and indirect activation (e.g. cytokine storm) of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2, shifting endothelium from an anti-thrombotic to a pro-thrombotic state; and (3) direct activation of complement pathways, promoting thrombin generation. Further investigation on how SARS-CoV-2 affects thrombosis in COVID-19 patients may bring novel anti-thrombotic therapies to combat the disease.	Mechanism;Treatment
34226798	"Retinal detachment during COVID-19 era: a review of challenges and solutions. Background: Since the beginning of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been obstacles in the proper diagnosis and management of many diseases. We evaluated the changes in retinal detachment (RD) presentation and surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic and propose solutions to minimize the detrimental effects of lockdown on RD diagnosis. Materials and methods: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant articles with the keywords ""Retinal detachment"" AND ""Coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR SARS OR MERS."" Results: The COVID-19 lockdown was associated a 53-66% reduction in RD presentation. The decrease in the rate of macula-on RD, the increase in the mean duration of symptoms, and the rise in the number of patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy were all suggestive of a delayed presentation of RD. Moreover, a drop of 56-62% in RD repair surgeries was observed. However, the most frequently performed ophthalmic surgery changed from cataract surgery in April 2019 to RD repair in April 2020. Using phacovitrectomy instead of vitrectomy alone can reduce the number of operations in ophthalmology centers, decrease the use of personal protective equipment by 50%, and cut costs per patient by 17-20%. Also, developing a well-organized telemedicine system can decrease unnecessary visits and delayed presentations. Conclusion: Delay in RD presentation and surgery is associated with a poorer prognosis. Optimizing the guidelines of RD management and developing a well-organized telemedicine system can minimize the impact of lockdown on RD management."	Prevention
34222432	Clinical characteristics, gastrointestinal manifestations and outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Iran; does the location matters? BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Asia, and Iran was one of its first epicenters. AIM: To study the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and comorbidities associated with this pandemic in four different regions of Iran. METHODS: We analyzed data from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patients evaluated at four hospitals of Iran (n = 91), including South (Shiraz), Southeast (Dezful), Rasht (North), and Northwest (Mashhad) between April and September 2020. Demographics, comorbidities and clinical findings including GI symptoms were collected. Statistical descriptive analysis and correlation analyses of symptoms, comorbidities, and mortality were performed. RESULTS: The average age of COVID-19 patients was 51.1 years, and 56% were male. Mortality rate was 17%. Cough with 84.6%, shortness of breath with 71.4%, fever with 52.7%, and loss of appetite with 43.9% were the main symptoms. Overall cardiac disease was the most common comorbidity with an average of 28.5% followed by hypertension (28.5%) and diabetes (25.2%). The highest comorbidity in North (Rasht) was diabetes (30%) and in South (Dezful) hypertension (37%). Shiraz leads cardiac disease with 43.4%. The most reported GI symptoms included nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, with 42.8%, 31.8%, 26.8%, and 12% prevalence, respectively. In addition, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were elevated in 26.3%. CONCLUSION: Our results show hypertension and diabetes as the most common comorbidities, but their distribution was different in COVID-19 patients in the four studied regions of Iran. Nausea, diarrhea, and elevated liver enzymes were the most common GI symptoms. There was also a high mortality rate that was associated with high infection rates in Iran at the beginning of the pandemic.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34282405	Deleterious Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Human Pancreatic Cells. COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than 154 million people worldwide and caused more than 3.2 million deaths. It is transmitted by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and affects the respiratory tract as well as extra-pulmonary systems, including the pancreas, that express the virus entry receptor, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Importantly, the endocrine and exocrine pancreas, the latter composed of ductal and acinar cells, express high levels of ACE2, which correlates to impaired functionality characterized as acute pancreatitis observed in some cases presenting with COVID-19. Since acute pancreatitis is already one of the most frequent gastrointestinal causes of hospitalization in the U.S. and the majority of studies investigating the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the pancreas are clinical and observational, we utilized human iPSC technology to investigate the potential deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures containing endocrine and exocrine cells. Interestingly, iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures allow SARS-CoV-2 entry and establish infection, thus perturbing their normal molecular and cellular phenotypes. The infection increased a key cytokine, CXCL12, known to be involved in inflammatory responses in the pancreas. Transcriptome analysis of infected pancreatic cultures confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the ribosomal machinery in these cells. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of the pancreas was confirmed in post-mortem tissues from COVID-19 patients, which showed co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 in pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells and increased the expression of some pancreatic ductal stress response genes. Thus, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect human iPSC-derived pancreatic cells with strong supporting evidence of presence of the virus in post-mortem pancreatic tissue of confirmed COVID-19 human cases. This novel model of iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures will open new avenues for the comprehension of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially establish a platform for endocrine and exocrine pancreas-specific antiviral drug screening.

34343468	Early determination of case fatality rate of COVID-19 pandemic during the ongoing Yemeni armed conflict. OBJECTIVES: To determine the case-fatality rate (CFR) of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated determinants in order to understand the true magnitude of the problem during ongoing conflict in Yemen. METHODS: The CFR among confirmed COVID-19 cases in Yemen was calculated. The data was retrieved from national COVID-19 surveillance between April 10, when the first COVID-19 case reported, and May 31, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 419 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported. There were 14.1% and 5.7% of cases who required intensive care and mechanical ventilators, respectively. Out of total cases, 95 deaths were reported, giving CFR of 22.6% which is much higher compared to other countries. CFR was significantly higher among elderly compared to young adults and varied between governorates. Mortality was associated with preexisting hypertension (OR: 2.30; 95%CI: 1.58, 3.54) and diabetes (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.61). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly and those with comorbidities, in particular hypertension and diabetes, have higher risk for poor outcomes and therefore should receive more attention in the clinical setting. Preventive measures should also be prioritized to protect those groups in order to reduce the severe cases and deaths-associated COVID-19 in armed-conflict.	Treatment;Diagnosis
34334966	Deep learning model for forecasting COVID-19 outbreak in Egypt. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic in early 2020. A comprehensive understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of this virus is crucial to limit its spreading. Therefore, this research applies artificial intelligence-based models to predict the prevalence of the COVID-19 outbreak in Egypt. These models are long short-term memory network (LSTM), convolutional neural network, and multilayer perceptron neural network. They are trained and validated using the dataset records from 14 February 2020 to 15 August 2020. The results of the models are evaluated using the determination coefficient and root mean square error. The LSTM model exhibits the best performance in forecasting the cumulative infections for one week and one month ahead. Finally, the LSTM model with the optimal parameter values is applied to forecast the spread of this epidemic for one month ahead using the data from 14 February 2020 to 30 June 2021. The total size of infections, recoveries, and deaths is estimated to be 285,939, 234,747, and 17,251 cases on 31 July 2021. This study could assist the decision-makers in developing and monitoring policies to confront this disease.	Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34216379	Does chronic oral anticoagulation reduce in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 older patients? BACKGROUND: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experienced an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. AIMS: To evaluate the effect of chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy, both with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), on prognosis of COVID-19 older patients. METHODS: Single-center prospective study conducted in the Emergency Department (ED) of a teaching hospital, referral center for COVID-19 in central Italy. We evaluated all the patients >/= 65 years, consecutively admitted to our ED for confirmed COVID-19. We compared the clinical outcome of those who were on chronic OAC at ED admission with those who did not, using a propensity score matched paired cohort of controls. The primary study endpoint was all-cause in-hospital death. Patients were matched for age, sex, clinical comorbidities, and clinical severity at presentation (based on NEWS >/= 6). Study parameters were assessed for association to all-cause in-hospital death by a multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify independent risk factor for survival. RESULTS: Although overall mortality was slightly higher for anticoagulated patients compared to controls (63.3% vs 43.5%, p = 0.012), the multivariate adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death was not significant (HR = 1.56 [0.78-3.12]; p = 0.208). Both DOACs (HR 1.46 [0.73-2.92]; p = 0.283) and VKAs (HR 1.14 [0.48-2.73]; p = 0.761) alone did not affect overall survival in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients hospitalized for COVID-19, chronic OAC therapy was not associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital death. Moreover, our data suggest similar outcome both for patients on VKAs or in patients on DOACs.	Diagnosis;Treatment

34219999	Notable and Emerging Variants of SARS-CoV-2 Virus: A Quick Glance. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), is a highly contagious pathogenic coronavirus to emerge and spread in human populations. Although substantial exertions have been laid to avert spread of COVID-19 by therapeutic and preventive countermeasures, but emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants as a result of mutations make the infection more ominous. New viral confers a higher nasopharyngeal viral load, increased viral transmissibility, higher infectiousness, immune escape, increased resistance to monoclonal/polyclonal antibodies from convalescence sera/vaccine, and an enhanced virulence. Thus, it is pertinent to monitor evolving mutations and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 as it is decisive for understanding the viral variants. In this review we provide an overview of colloquial nomenclature and the genetic characteristics of different SARS-CoV-2 variants in the context of mutational changes of the circulating strains, transmissibility potential, virulence and infectivity.

34200418	Development of a Promising Method for Producing Oligomeric Mixture of Branched Alkylene Guanidines to Improve Substance Quality and Evaluate Their Antiviral Activity against SARS-CoV-2. This paper reports the synthesis of branched alkylene guanidines using microfluidic technologies. We describe the preparation of guanidine derivatives at lower temperatures, and with significantly less time than that required in the previously applicable method. Furthermore, the use of microfluidics allows the attainment of high-purity products with a low residual monomer content, which can expand the range of applications of this class of compounds. For all the samples obtained, the molecular-weight characteristics are calculated, based on which the optimal condensation conditions are established. Additionally, in this work, the antiviral activity of the alkylene guanidine salt against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is confirmed.	Treatment
34220293	Thermotropic effects of PEGylated lipids on the stability of HPPH-encapsulated lipid nanoparticles (LNP). In this work, we demonstrate the enhanced thermal and steric stability of lipid-based formulations in the presence of encapsulated HPPH that have demonstrated potential cancer applications in previously presented in vivo studies. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used to study the phase transitions, and domain formations, and to qualify the thermodynamic properties associated with change in lipid bilayer behavior due to the presence of PEGylated at varying concentrations and sizes, and the encapsulated HPPH molecules. Thermal instability was quantified by dramatic changes in calculated enthalpy, and the shape of the melting peak or calculated half width of melting peak. This systematic study focused on understanding the effects of varying molecular mass and concentrations of PEG polymers in the photopolymerizable lipid DC8, 9PC lipid bilayer matrix for four weeks at room temperature of 25 degrees C. The major findings include increased thermal stability of the lipid bilayer due to the presence of PEG-2 K and the HPPH that resulted from the van der Waals forces between various molecular species, and the change in bilayer curvature confirmed via mathematical correlations. It is demonstrated that the encapsulation of therapeutics in lipid formulations can alter their overall thermal behavior, and therefore, it is imperative to consider calorimetric effects while designing lipid-based vaccines. The presented research methodologies and findings presented can predict the stability of lipid-based vaccines that are under development such as COVID-19 during their storage, transport, and distribution.

34205768	Targeting 3CLpro and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by Amphimedon sp. Metabolites: A Computational Study. Since December 2019, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused tremendous economic loss and serious health problems worldwide. In this study, we investigated 14 natural compounds isolated from Amphimedon sp. via a molecular docking study, to examine their ability to act as anti-COVID-19 agents. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic properties of the most promising compounds were studied. The docking study showed that virtually screened compounds were effective against the new coronavirus via dual inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and the 3CL main protease. In particular, nakinadine B (1), 20-hepacosenoic acid (11) and amphimedoside C (12) were the most promising compounds, as they demonstrated good interactions with the pockets of both enzymes. Based on the analysis of the molecular docking results, compounds 1 and 12 were selected for molecular dynamics simulation studies. Our results showed Amphimedon sp. to be a rich source for anti-COVID-19 metabolites.	Mechanism;Treatment
34373110	Reduction of the emergency activity, during the Covid 19 Italian lockdown, what's the lesson to learn? The COVID 19 pandemic was declared on the 9(th) of March 2020. The health crisis affected the whole world with a very high and unexpected number of infected people. The situation forced the declaration of lockdown and a worldwide health system reorganization. Surprisingly, the social distancing laws caused a reduction of urgent hospital activities not COVID 19 related. The aim of this manuscript is to analyze the reasons why fewer emergencies were described during the 2020 Italian lockdown. The Data reporting urgent Emergency Room (ER) activity, during the first three weeks of the Italian lockdown (Group 1), were analyzed and compared with the same period in 2019 (Group 2). During the study period in 2020, there was a 46,5% reduction in ER activity compared to that in 2019. Nevertheless, the hospitalization rate was higher in the 2020 then in 2019 (p<0.05). The present data showed that almost half of the basic ER activity araised from mild health problems that could be followed by territorial health services. The strengthening of territorial medical services would allow hospitals to handle critical situations more easily and to focus activity by reducing the waiting list.	Prevention
34334658	Supporting Feeding of Late Preterm Infants in the Hospital: A Quality Improvement Project. ABSTRACT: Background: Feeding difficulty is the most common cause of delayed hospital discharge and readmission of late preterm infants. Frequent and adequate feedings from birth are protective against dehydration, hypoglycemia, and jaundice. The National Perinatal Association's feeding guidelines provide the foundation for late preterm infant standards of care. Feeding at least every 3 hours promotes nutritional status and neurologic development. One feeding assessment every 12 hours during the hospital stay can ensure quality of infant feeding.Problem: At a large urban hospital, medical record reviews were completed to evaluate nursing care practices consistent with the hospital's late preterm infant care standard policy. Feeding frequency and nurse assessment of feeding effectiveness were far below acceptable targets. A quality improvement team was formed to address inconsistency with expected practice.Methods: The project included an investigation using the define, design, implement, and sustain method of quality improvement. Parent education, nurse education, and visual cues were developed to sustain enhanced nursing practice.Results: Late preterm infants who received feedings at least every 3 hours increased from 2.5% (1 of 40) to 27% (11 of 40); (M = 0.275, SD = 0.446), p = 0.001. Documented breastfeeding assessments increased from 2% (5 of 264) to 8% (10 of 126), p = 0.001. Documented bottle-feeding assessments increased from 15% (39 of 264) to 31% (53 of 172), p < 0.001. Intervention time was cut short due to reprioritization of efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Conclusion: Interventions and implementation of this process improvement is easy to replicate through attainable and sustainable goals directed toward improved outcomes for late preterm infants.

34281499	Diagnostic delay of acute mitral regurgitation during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: a case report. BACKGROUND: Diagnostic errors or delays can cause serious consequences for patient safety, especially in the emergency department. Anchoring bias is one of the major factors leading to diagnostic error. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the high probability of COVID-19 in febrile patients could be a major cause of anchoring bias leading to diagnostic error. In addition, certain evaluations such as auscultation are difficult to perform on a casual basis due to the increased risk of contact infection, which lead to inadequate assessment of the patients with valvular disease. Acute mitral regurgitation (MR) could be a fatal disease in the emergency department, especially if there is a diagnostic error or delay in diagnosis. It is often reported that diagnosis can be difficult even though there is no treatment other than emergent surgery. The diagnosis of acute MR has become more difficult because coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could affect our daily practice especially in febrile patients. We report a case of a diagnostic delay of a febrile patient because of anchoring bias during the COVID-19 pandemic. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of acute dyspnea and fever. Based on vital signs and computed tomography of the chest, acute pneumonia due to COVID-19 was suspected. Auscultation was avoided because of facility rule based on concern of contact infection. After admission to the intensive care unit, Doppler echocardiography revealed acute mitral regurgitation, and transesophageal echocardiography revealed mitral valve tendon rupture. After confirming the negative result for the polymerase chain reaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, mitral valvuloplasty was performed on the third day after admission. The patient was discharged 14 days after admission without complications. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 pandemic, anchoring bias suspecting COVID-19 among febrile patients becomes a strong heuristic factor. A thorough history and physical examination is still important in febrile patients presenting with dyspnea to ensure the correct diagnosis of acute mitral regurgitation.	Case Report
34353790	Clinicians' and patients' experiences of managing heart failure during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) resulted in unprecedented societal and healthcare provision change that has been implemented at pace. Little is known about the indirect impacts of these changes and what the future effects may be. AIM: To explore patients' and clinicians' experiences of managing heart failure (HF) during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN & SETTING: Qualitative study in three regions of the UK: Cambridgeshire, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews (n=30) were conducted with older adults with established HF and healthcare providers from primary and secondary health services involved in their care. Interviews were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Compliance with the government guidance 'Stay home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives' during the COVID-19 pandemic and perceptions relating to risk from COVID-19 and underlying morbidity, drove 'being careful' behaviours and organisational changes. Enacting behavioural change and implementing organisational change resulted in opportunities and challenges for health and healthcare practice. CONCLUSION: Perception of risk led to significant behavioural and organisational change during the pandemic. Some changes described by both patients and clinicians, such as enhanced relationships and self-monitoring, present as opportunities and consideration should be given as to how to maintain or develop these. Equally, indirect impacts of COVID-19 and the associated lockdown such as disengagement and withdrawal, and the fallout from reluctance to access health services, should be acknowledged and interventions to address these challenges are needed.

34355116	Does high COVID-19 spread impact neighbouring countries? Evidence from Ireland. Background : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has necessitated public health responses on an unprecedented scale. Controlling infectious diseases requires understanding of the conditions that increase spread. Prior studies have identified sociodemographic, epidemiological and geographic associations. Ireland offers an unusual opportunity to quantify how high infection rates in one country impacted cases in a neighbouring country. Methods : We analysed official statistics on confirmed COVID-19 cases on the island of Ireland for 52 weeks from March 2020. Our main research question was: Did higher cases in Northern Ireland (NI) impact the number of cases in the Republic of Ireland (ROI)? We used least squares regression to compare confirmed cases in ROI counties that border NI with the rest of the state. We included in our model sociodemographic, epidemiological and geographic factors. We employed the latitude of each county town as an instrumental variable to isolate a quasi-experimental estimate of the cross-border spread. Results : In the quasi-experimental framework, and controlling for population density, age distribution and circulatory disease prevalence, border counties had an extra 21.0 (95%CI: 8.4-33.6) confirmed COVID-19 cases per 1000 people. This equates to an estimated 9,611 additional cases in ROI, or 4% of the national total in the first year of the pandemic. Our results were substantively similar in non-experimental frameworks, with alternative additional predictors, and in sensitivity analyses. Additionally, population density in ROI counties was positively associated with confirmed cases and higher proportions of residents in the professional classes was negatively associated. Conclusion : On the island of Ireland during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, high infection rates in NI increased cases in the neighbouring ROI. Maximising co-ordination of pandemic responses among neighbouring countries is essential to minimising disease spread, and its associated disruptions to society and the economy. Socioeconomic disadvantage appeared to confer significant additional risk of spread.	Prevention
34351892	Risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the pediatric population. INTRODUCCION: Hasta ahora existen pocos estudios sobre las caracteristicas clinicas de la poblacion pediatrica con neumonia por COVID-19. El objetivo de este estudio fue analizar los datos que se asocian con el desarrollo de neumonia en ninos y adolescentes con infeccion por SARS-CoV-2 en Mexico. METODOS: Se llevo a cabo un analisis secundario de la base de datos de la Direccion General de Epidemiologia del Gobierno Mexicano. Se incluyeron menores de 19 anos con infeccion por SARS-CoV-2 confirmada mediante la prueba de retrotranscripcion acoplada a la reaccion en cadena de la polimerasa (RT-PCR). La variable dependiente fue el diagnostico de neumonia. Se calcularon las razones de momios (RM) y los intervalos de confianza del 95% (IC95%). Se realizaron modelos de regresion logistica multiple para ajustar los factores asociados a neumonia. RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron 1443 ninos con diagnostico de COVID-19. La mediana de edad de los participantes fue de 12 anos (rango intercuartilar 25-75: 5-16). La neumonia se presento en 141 ninos (9.8%). Los principales factores de riesgo fueron edad < 3 anos (RM: 3.5; IC95%: 2.45-5.03), diabetes u obesidad (RM: 12.6; IC95%: 4.62-34.91) e inmunocompromiso (RM: 7.03; IC95%: 3.97-13.61). CONCLUSIONES: Los ninos con COVID-19 menores de 3 anos y con comorbilidad, especialmente diabetes u obesidad, y los inmunocomprometidos presentan mayor riesgo de desarrollar neumonia. BACKGROUND: Currently, there are a few studies on the clinical characteristics of the pediatric population with COVID-19 and pneumonia. This study aimed to analyze data associated with the development of pneumonia in children and adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout Mexico. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the database of the Direccion General de Epidemiologia of the Mexican Government. We included children under the age of 19 who were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The dependent variable was the diagnosis of pneumonia. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Multiple logistic regression models were performed to adjust factors associated with pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 1443 children with a COVID-19 diagnosis were included. The median age of the participants was 12 years (interquartile range 25, 75: 5, 16). Pneumonia occurred in 141 children (9.8%). The main risk factors were age < 3 years (OR, 3.5; 95%CI, 2.45-5.03); diabetes or obesity (OR, 12.6; 95%CI, 4.62-34.91); and immunocompromise (OR, 7.03; 95%CI, 3.97-13.61). CONCLUSIONS: Children < 3 years with COVID-19 and comorbidities, especially diabetes or obesity, and immunocompromised patients have a higher risk of developing pneumonia.	Diagnosis
34350701	Upsurge of human rhinovirus infection followed by a delayed seasonal respiratory syncytial virus infection in Thai children during the coronavirus pandemic. BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) commonly cause influenza-like illness in young children. The global coronavirus pandemic beginning in 2020 altered the seasonality and prevalence of these respiratory infections in Thailand. We aimed to characterize the upsurge of HRV and the subsequent RSV infection observed among young children who sought medical care at a hospital in Bangkok. METHODS: From July to December 2020, nasopharyngeal swabs from children </=5 years of age presented with influenza-like illness were tested for RSV and HRV using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Positive samples were Sanger sequenced. Genotyping was performed using sequence and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Upsurge of HRV infection began in July and was subsequently replaced by a surge of RSV infection from September onward. In 6 months, HRV was detected in 27.5% (158/574) of the samples, of which 44% (69/158) were HRV-A, 7% (11/158) were HRV-B, and 36% (57/158) were HRV-C. Meanwhile, RSV was detected in 40.4% (232/574) of the samples, of which 78% (181/232) were RSV-A and 6% (14/232) were RSV-B. RSV peaked in October 2020, approximately 2 months later than typically seen in previous years. All RSV-A were of subgenotype ON1. Codetection of HRV and RSV was found in 5.1% (29/574). CONCLUSIONS: HRV and RSV infection among young children coincided with relaxed local coronavirus public health measures, including the return to in-class schooling. The delayed RSV season in 2020 was predominantly associated with RSV-A.	Prevention
34377452	Guillain Barre syndrome as a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection: A case report. Introduction: Covid-19 infection usually manifests with respiratory symptoms, but neurological signs might be the mean symptom revealing this infection such as Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS).COVID-19 associated GBS seems to be more severe than non-COVID-19 GBS. Case management: We reported a 49 old-man admitted in the intensive care unit for bilateral ascending symmetrical paresthesia associated with lower limb numbness and sphincter disorders two weeks after an upper respiratory infection. The diagnosis of post-Covid-19 GBS was maintained, and the evolution was favorable after Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PLEX) as a second therapy. Conclusion: This case report suggest the probable causal link between COVID 19 and GBS. This severe association prompts us to do further research that may help professionals in an early diagnosis and early treatment thus improving morbidity and mortality.	Case Report
34210574	Tolerance of BNT162b2 mRNA COVI-19 vaccine in patients with a medical history of COVID-19 disease: A case control study. INTRODUCTION: Studies evaluating BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine safety excluded subjects with a previous history of COVID-19 infection. The aim of our study was to focus on the tolerance of this vaccine this population. METHODS: An anonymous self-reporting survey related to safety and tolerance of vaccine was completed by subjects 21 to 28 days after the first vaccine dose in two vaccination centers. RESULTS: Subjects with prior COVID-19 disease history (n = 61) had higher systemic reactions than subjects without any previous history (n = 1987) (45.9% vs 29.7%, p = 0.01). Asthenia, headache and fever were significantly more frequent in COVID-19 + group than negative group (25.6% vs 15.2% p = 0.045, 19.7% vs 9.3% p = 0.01, 6.5% vs 0.9% p = 0.003 respectively). Grade of severity was higher in COVID-19 + than in COVID-19 - group (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms a higher risk of side effects in patients with preexisting SARS-CoV-2 disease but with a good overall tolerance.	Treatment
34216117	The Safety and Efficacy of Anakinra, an Interleukin-1 Antagonist in Severe Cases of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. This study aims to assess anakinra's safety and efficacy for treating severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Numerous electronic databases were searched and finally 15 studies with a total of 3,530 patients, 757 in the anakinra arm, 1,685 in the control arm were included. The pooled adjusted odds ratio (OR) for mortality in the treatment arm was 0.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 - 0.54, I(2) = 48%), indicating a significant association between anakinra and mortality. A significant association was found regarding mechanical ventilation requirements in anakinra group compared to the control group OR, 0.68 (95% CI, 0.49 - 0.95, I(2) = 50%). For the safety of anakinra, we evaluated thromboembolism risk and liver transaminases elevation. Thromboembolism risk was OR, 1.59 (95% CI, 0.65 - 3.91, I(2) = 0%) and elevation in liver transaminases with OR was 1.35 (95% CI, 0.61 - 3.03, I(2) = 76%). Both were not statistically significant over the control group. Anakinra is beneficial in lowering mortality in COVID-19 patients. However, these non-significant differences in the safety profile between the anakinra and control groups may have been the result of baseline characteristics of the intervention group, and further studies are essential in evaluating anakinra's safety profile.

34208922	Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Time to Weaning Off the Invasive Mechanical Ventilator among Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is the main cause of the pandemic's death toll. The assessment of ARDS and time on invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) could enhance the characterization of outcomes and management of this condition. This is a city-wide retrospective study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from 5 March 2020 to 30 June 2020. Patients with critical illness were compared with those with non-critical illness. We examined the severity of ARDS and other factors associated with (i) weaning patients off IMV and (ii) mortality in a city-wide study in Louisville, KY. Of 522 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 219 (41.9%) were critically ill. Among critically ill patients, the median age was 60 years; 53% were male, 55% were White and 32% were African American. Of all critically ill patients, 52% had ARDS, and 38% of these had severe ARDS. Of the 25% of patients who were weaned off IMV, those with severe ARDS were weaned within eleven days versus five days for those without severe ARDS, p = 0.023. The overall mortality for critically ill patients was 22% versus 1% for those not critically ill. Furthermore, the 14-day mortality was 31% for patients with severe ARDS and 12% for patients without severe ARDS, p = 0.019. Patients with severe ARDS versus non-severe ARDS needed twice as long to wean off IMV (eleven versus five days) and had double the 14-day mortality of patients without severe ARDS.

34198591	Screening, Diagnostic and Prognostic Tests for COVID-19: A Comprehensive Review. While molecular testing with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the gold-standard test for COVID-19 diagnosis and screening, more rapid or affordable molecular and antigen testing options have been developed. More affordable, point-of-care antigen testing, despite being less sensitive compared to molecular assays, might be preferable for wider screening initiatives. Simple laboratory, imaging and clinical parameters could facilitate prognostication and triage. This comprehensive review summarises current evidence on the diagnostic, screening and prognostic tests for COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34284551	DIC, SIC or CAC - the haemostatic profile in COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the intensive care unit: a single-centre retrospective analysis. INTRODUCTION: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in its most severe form leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation under the conditions of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The state of hypercoagulation described in COVID-19 may deepen respiratory failure, leading to increased mortality. The aim of the presented study is to characterise the haemostatic profile based on the results of clotting system parameters and risk assessment of thromboembolic complications of patients hospitalised in the ICU. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study covered the first 10 adult patients hospitalised in the ICU of the Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Warsaw in the second quarter of 2020. Demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters of the coagulation system and the risk of thromboembolic complications were assessed. Well known criteria of haemostatic disorders were used to classify the observed derangements. RESULTS: The most frequently observed deviations in the coagulation system were high concentrations of D-dimer and fibrinogen. In select cases the clotting time was prolonged. No severe thrombocytopenia was observed. All patients presented a high risk of thromboembolic complications as assesed by the Padua score. The observed clotting abnormalities did not meet the criteria for DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) and SIC (sepsis-induced coagulopathy) diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The main elements of coagulopathy that were observed in our cases differ from those usually seen in patients with recognised sepsis. The unique haemostatic profile of COVID-19 patients treated in the ICU has been described as CAC (COVID-19-associated coagulopathy).	Diagnosis;Treatment
34220844	The Antigenicity of Epidemic SARS-CoV-2 Variants in the United Kingdom. To determine whether the neutralization activity of monoclonal antibodies, convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera was affected by the top five epidemic SARS-CoV-2 variants in the UK, including D614G+L18F+A222V, D614G+A222V, D614G+S477N, VOC-202012/01(B.1.1.7) and D614G+69-70del+N439K, a pseudovirus-neutralization assay was performed to evaluate the relative neutralization titers against the five SARS-CoV-2 variants and 12 single deconvolution mutants based on the variants. In this study, 18 monoclonal antibodies, 10 sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients, 10 inactivated-virus vaccine-elicited sera, 14 mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, nine RBD-immunized mouse sera, four RBD-immunized horse sera, and four spike-encoding DNA-immunized guinea pig sera were tested and analyzed. The N501Y, N439K, and S477N mutations caused immune escape from nine of 18 mAbs. However, the convalescent sera, inactivated virus vaccine-elicited sera, mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, spike DNA-elicited sera, and recombinant RBD protein-elicited sera could still neutralize these variants (within three-fold changes compared to the reference D614G variant). The neutralizing antibody responses to different types of vaccines were different, whereby the response to inactivated-virus vaccine was similar to the convalescent sera.	Mechanism;Treatment
34207018	Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccine among the Healthcare Workers in the Eastern Cape, South Africa: A Cross Sectional Study. BACKGROUND: This study assesses the perceptions and acceptance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination. It also examines its influencing factors among the healthcare workers (HCWs) in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study performed in November and December 2020, a total of 1308 HCWs from two large academic hospitals participated in the Eastern Cape Healthcare Workers Acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 (ECHAS) study. Validated measures of vaccine hesitancy were explored using a questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to identify the determinants of vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: The majority were nurses (45.2%), and at risk for unfavourable Covid-19 outcome, due to obesity (62.9%) and having direct contact with individuals confirmed to have Covid-19 (77.1%). The overall acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was 90.1%, which differed significantly by level of education. Individuals with lower educational attainment (primary and secondary education) and those with prior vaccine refusal were less likely to accept the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, positive perceptions about the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were independently associated with vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is reassuring; however, HCWs with a lower level of education and those with prior vaccine refusal should be targeted for further engagements to address their concerns and fears.

34214467	Systematic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection of an ACE2-negative human airway cell. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) variants govern transmissibility, responsiveness to vaccination, and disease severity. In a screen for new models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identify human H522 lung adenocarcinoma cells as naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection despite complete absence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression. Remarkably, H522 infection requires the E484D S variant; viruses expressing wild-type S are not infectious. Anti-S monoclonal antibodies differentially neutralize SARS-CoV-2 E484D S in H522 cells as compared to ACE2-expressing cells. Sera from vaccinated individuals block this alternative entry mechanism, whereas convalescent sera are less effective. Although the H522 receptor remains unknown, depletion of surface heparan sulfates block H522 infection. Temporally resolved transcriptomic and proteomic profiling reveal alterations in cell cycle and the antiviral host cell response, including MDA5-dependent activation of type I interferon signaling. These findings establish an alternative SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor for the E484D SARS-CoV-2 variant, which may impact tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and consequently human disease pathogenesis.

34286106	Hospital admissions from care homes in England during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis using linked administrative data. Background: Care home residents have complex healthcare needs but may have faced barriers to accessing hospital treatment during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: To examine trends in the number of hospital admissions for care home residents during the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Retrospective analysis of a national linked dataset on hospital admissions for residential and nursing home residents in England (257,843 residents, 45% in nursing homes) between 20 January 2020 and 28 June 2020, compared to admissions during the corresponding period in 2019 (252,432 residents, 45% in nursing homes). Elective and emergency admission rates, normalised to the time spent in care homes across all residents, were derived across the first three months of the pandemic between 1 March and 31 May 2020 and primary admission reasons for this period were compared across years. Results: Hospital admission rates rapidly declined during early March 2020 and remained substantially lower than in 2019 until the end of June. Between March and May, 2,960 admissions from residential homes (16.2%) and 3,295 admissions from nursing homes (23.7%) were for suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Rates of other emergency admissions decreased by 36% for residential and by 38% for nursing home residents (13,191 fewer admissions in total). Emergency admissions for acute coronary syndromes fell by 43% and 29% (105 fewer admission) and emergency admissions for stroke fell by 17% and 25% (128 fewer admissions) for residential and nursing home residents, respectively. Elective admission rates declined by 64% for residential and by 61% for nursing home residents (3,762 fewer admissions). Conclusions: This is the first study showing that care home residents' hospital use declined during the first wave of COVID-19, potentially resulting in substantial unmet health need that will need to be addressed alongside ongoing pressures from COVID-19.

34215532	[Smart sensors in pregnancy: Narrative review on the use of smart home technology in routine prenatal care]. INTRODUCTION: Today's routine prenatal care in Germany includes regular in-person appointments of pregnant women with doctors or midwives. Considering an increasing digitalization of the healthcare sector and in view of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency of in-person visits could be reduced by remote monitoring using smart sensor technology. We aim to give an overview of the current international research on the use of smart sensors in prenatal care and its benefits, costs and resource consumption. METHODS: For this narrative review, PubMed and Science Direct were searched for clinical trials using smart sensors in prenatal care published in English or German language from 1/2016 to 12/2020. We included studies which addressed the benefits, costs and resource consumption of this innovative technology. RESULTS: We identified 13 projects using smart sensors in the fields of basic prenatal care, prenatal care for patients with hypertensive disease in pregnancy and prenatal care for women with gestational diabetes. The projects detected positive effects of smart sensors on health care costs and resource consumption and at least equal benefits for the pregnant women. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The current COVID-19 pandemic underlines the need for the introduction of smart sensor technology into German prenatal care routine. Remote monitoring could easily reduce the frequency of in-person visits by half. Smart sensor concepts could be approved as digital health applications in Germany. In order to increase user acceptance, there should not be any additional costs for pregnant women and health care professionals using modern healthcare apps. However, health insurance providers need to invest in smart sensor technology in order to eventually benefit from it.	Prevention
34209533	Can SARS-CoV-2 Induce Uterine Vascular Anomalies and Poor Contractile Response?-A Case Report. We are reporting a case of a 36 year-old Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive hypertensive primigravida with postpartum uterine atony that required emergency subtotal hysterectomy at Saint John Hospital Bucur Maternity Bucharest. The maternity was designated as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Maternity for Bucharest and Ilfov County since March 2020. The patient was mildly symptomatic for SARS-CoV-2, infection confirmed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The caesarean section was performed and a live male fetus was born, 2630 g and Apgar Score of 9 (the male fetus was negative for SARS-CoV-2). Postpartum hysterectomy with adnexal preservation was performed because of uterine atony. The postoperative evolution was favorable. The patient was discharged with her baby 10 days after birth. Given the limited resources, the placenta, the umbilical cord and the uterus were not tested for SARS-CoV-2. The pathology exam revealed that on the maternal side there were specific uterine atony lesions as well as endometrial and miometrial ischaemia. The placenta had nonspecific findings: chronic ischemic lesions with small villi, fibrin deposits in the materno-fetal interface. The peculiarity of the case is that we report the morphological findings of the placenta and uterus resulted from intrapartum uterine atonia in a patient with gestational arterial hypertension, premature birth and COVID-19. Further studies are required to characterize the pattern of such intricate conditions.	Case Report

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a common complication of type 1 and 2 diabetes and often presents during adolescence and young adulthood. Given the growing incidence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, DKD represents a significant public health problem. Acute kidney injury (AKI) in youth with diabetes is strongly associated with risk of DKD development. This review will summarize the epidemiology and pathophysiology of AKI in children with diabetes, the relationship between AKI and DKD, and the potential therapeutic interventions. Finally, we will appraise the impact of the recent COVID-19 infection pandemic on AKI in children with diabetes.	Treatment;Diagnosis;Prevention
34288536	The relationship of serum testosterone levels with the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19 disease in male patients: A prospective study. BACKGROUND: A potential role of testosterone among sex hormones has been hypothesized in identifying sex-related differences in the clinical consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Due to the high global prevalence of hypogonadism, the relationship between hypogonadism and SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes deserves an in-depth study. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the relationship of serum testosterone with other laboratory parameters on the prognosis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in male patients with COVID-19 diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 358 male patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 92 COVID-19 negative patients admitted to the urology outpatient clinics as a control group. The COVID-19 patients were divided into groups according to prognosis (mild-moderate and severe group), lung involvement in chest computed tomography (<50% and >50%), intensive care unit needs, and survival. RESULTS: The measured serum total testosterone level of the COVID-19 patients group was found to be significantly lower than that of the control group (median, 140 ng/dl; range, 0.21-328, 322 ng/dl; range, median, 125-674, p < 0.001, respectively). The serum TT levels were statistically significantly lower in severe COVID-19 patients compared to mild-moderate COVID-19 patients (median, 85.1 ng/dl; range, 0.21-532, median, 315 ng/dl; range, 0.88-486, p < 0.001, respectively), in COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care compared to COVID-19 patients who did not need intensive care (median, 64.0 ng/dl; range, 0.21-337, median, 286 ng/dl; range, 0.88-532 p < 0.001, respectively), and in COVID-19 patients who died compared to survivors (median, 82.9 ng/dl; range, 2.63-165, median, 166 ng/dl; range, 0.21-532, p < 0.001, respectively). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our data are compatible with low TT levels playing a role on the pathogenesis of the disease in Covid-19 patients with poor prognosis and a mortal course and may guide clinicians in determining the clinical course of the disease.

34216156	Assessment of serological assays for identifying high titer convalescent plasma. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by the largest mobilization of therapeutic convalescent plasma (CCP) in over a century. Initial identification of high titer units was based on dose-response data using the Ortho VITROS IgG assay. The proliferation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 serological assays and non-uniform application has led to uncertainty about their interrelationships. The purpose of this study was to establish correlations and analogous cutoffs between multiple serological assays. METHODS: We compared the Ortho, Abbott, Roche, an anti-spike (S) ELISA, and a virus neutralization assay. Relationships relative to FDA-approved cutoffs under the CCP emergency use authorization were identified in convalescent plasma from a cohort of 79 donors from April 2020. RESULTS: Relative to the neutralization assay, the spearman r value of the Ortho Clinical, Abbott, Roche, anti-S ELISA assays was 0.65, 0.59, 0.45, and 0.76, respectively. The best correlative index for establishing high-titer units was 3.87 signal-to-cutoff (S/C) for the Abbott, 13.82 cutoff index for the Roche, 1:1412 for the anti-S ELISA, 1:219 by the neutralization assay, and 15.9 S/C by the Ortho Clinical assay. The overall agreement using derived cutoffs compared to a neutralizing titer of 1:250 was 78.5% for Abbott, 74.7% for Roche, 83.5% for the anti-S ELISA, and 78.5% for Ortho Clinical. DISCUSSION: Assays based on antibodies against the nucleoprotein were positively associated with neutralizing titers and the Ortho assay, although their ability to distinguish FDA high-titer specimens was imperfect. The resulting relationships help reconcile results from the large body of serological data generated during the COVID-19 pandemic.	Diagnosis
34352565	Modelling the spread of covid-19 in the capital of Brazil using numerical solution and cellular automata. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) still challenges researchers due to its spread and deaths. Hence, the classical epidemic SIR and SEIRD models inspired by the epidemic's outbreak are widely used to predict the evolution of the disease. In addition to classical approaches, describing complex phenomena through Cellular Automata (CA) is a highly effective way to understand the iterations on a populated system. The present research analyzed the usage of CA to generate an epidemic-computational model from a micro perspective based on parameters obtained through a statistical fit from a macro perspective. After validating SIR and SEIRD models with the government official data for Brasilia, Brazil, the authors applied the obtained parameters to the Cellular Automata model. The CA model simulated the spread of the virus from infected to uninfected people in a restrained environment (i.e., a supermarket) under several varied conditions applying an approach never adopted before. The manner of applying CA in this research proved to represent an essential tool in predicting the spread of the coronavirus in confined spaces with random movements of people. The CA numerical open-source presented has the purpose of clarifying how the spread occurs not only as a mathematical curve but in an organic way. The numerical simulations from the CA model allowed the authors to conclude that markets and stores are relevant places where might be infections. Thus, every local store and the market owner should reason about the aspects that could avoid the spread of the disease, coming up with efficient solutions. Each environment has specific features that only those who know them are the ones capable of managing.	Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34285557	Impact of Computed Tomography-Quantified Emphysema Score on Clinical Outcome in Patients with COVID-19. Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is considered a risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, data on the prognostic impact of radiological emphysema extent on patients with COVID-19 are limited. Thus, this study aimed to examine whether computed tomography (CT)-quantified emphysema score is associated with a worse clinical outcome in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Volumetric quantitative analyses of CT images were performed to obtain emphysema scores in COVID-19 patients admitted to four tertiary referral hospitals in Daegu, South Korea, between February 18 and March 25, 2020. Patients were divided into three groups according to emphysema score (emphysema score </=1%, 1%< emphysema score </=5%, and emphysema score >5%). Results: A total of 146 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The median emphysema score was 1.0% (interquartile range, 0.5-1.8%). Eight patients (6%) had a previous COPD diagnosis. Eighty (55%), 55 (38%), and 11 (8%) patients had emphysema scores </=1%, between 1% and 5%, and >5%, respectively. The number of patients who received oxygen therapy two weeks after admission was significantly higher in the group with emphysema scores >5% than in other groups (p=0.025). The frequency of deaths was three (27%) in the group with emphysema scores >5% and tended to be higher than that in other groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, COPD, and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were associated with a greater risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: The current study demonstrated that patients with CT-quantified emphysema scores >5% tended to progress to severe disease over time; however, they did not exhibit an increased risk of mortality in our COVID-19 cohort. Further studies with consideration of both emphysema extent and airflow limitation degree are warranted.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34213770	Aerosol Generation During Laryngology Procedures in the Operating Room. OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 spreads through respiratory fluids. We aim to quantify aerosolized particles during laryngology procedures to understand their potential for transmission of infectious aerosol-based diseases. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective quantification of aerosol generation. METHODS: Airborne particles (0.3-25 mum in diameter) were measured during live-patient laryngology surgeries using an optical particle counter positioned 60 cm from the oral cavity to the surgeon's left. Measurements taken during the procedures were compared to baseline concentrations recorded immediately before each procedure. Procedures included direct laryngoscopy with general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA), direct laryngoscopy with jet ventilation, and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) laser use with or without jet ventilation, all utilizing intermittent suction. RESULTS: Greater than 99% of measured particles were 0.3 to 1.0 mum in diameter. Compared to baseline, direct laryngoscopy was associated with a significant 6.71% increase in cumulative particles, primarily 0.3 to 1.0 mum particles (P < .0001). 1.0 to 25 mum particles significantly decreased (P < .001). Jet ventilation was not associated with a significant change in cumulative particles; when analyzing differential particle sizes, only 10 to 25 mum particles exhibited a significant increase compared to baseline (+42.40%, P = .002). Significant increases in cumulative particles were recorded during CO2 laser use (+14.70%, P < .0001), specifically in 0.3 to 2.5 mum particles. Overall, there was no difference when comparing CO2 laser use during jet ventilation versus GETA. CONCLUSIONS: CO2 laser use during laryngology surgery is associated with significant increases in airborne particles. Although direct laryngoscopy with GETA is associated with slight increases in particles, jet ventilation overall does not increase particle aerosolization. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III Laryngoscope, 2021.

34228761	Early treatment with a combination of two potent neutralizing antibodies improves clinical outcomes and reduces virus replication and lung inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infected macaques. There is an urgent need for effective therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2, including new variants that continue to arise. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have shown promise in clinical studies. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of a combination of two potent monoclonal antibodies, C135-LS and C144-LS that carry half-life extension mutations, in the rhesus macaque model of COVID-19. Twelve young adult macaques (three groups of four animals) were inoculated intranasally and intra-tracheally with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2 and 24 hours later, treated intravenously with a high (40 mg/kg) or low (12 mg/kg) dose of the C135-LS and C144-LS antibody combination, or a control monoclonal antibody. Animals were monitored for 7 days. Compared to the control animals, animals treated with either dose of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies showed similarly improved clinical scores, lower levels of virus replication in upper and lower respiratory tract, and significantly reduced interstitial pneumonia, as measured by comprehensive lung histology. In conclusion, this study provides proof-of-concept in support of further clinical development of these monoclonal antibodies against COVID-19 during early infection.	Treatment;Mechanism
34372616	Antiviral Effect of Budesonide against SARS-CoV-2. Treatment options for COVID-19, a disease caused by Severe&nbsp;Acute&nbsp;Respiratory&nbsp;Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, are currently severely limited. Therefore, antiviral drugs that efficiently reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication or alleviate COVID-19 symptoms are urgently needed. Inhaled glucocorticoids are currently being discussed in the context of treatment for COVID-19, partly based on a previous study that reported reduced recovery times in cases of mild COVID-19 after inhalative administration of the glucocorticoid budesonide. Given various reports that describe the potential antiviral activity of glucocorticoids against respiratory viruses, we aimed to analyze a potential antiviral activity of budesonide against SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.351 (beta). We demonstrate a dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 that was comparable between all viral variants tested while cell viability remains unaffected. Our results are encouraging as they could indicate a multimodal mode of action of budesonide against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, which could contribute to an improved clinical performance.	Treatment
34212076	Adverse Effects of Personal Protective Equipment Among Intensive Care Unit Healthcare Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review. Introduction: To avoid exposure to SARS-COV-2, healthcare professionals use personal protective equipment (PPE) while treating COVID-19 patients. Prior studies have revealed the adverse effects (AEs) of PPE on healthcare workers (HCWs); however, no review has focused on the AEs of PPE on HCWs in intensive care units (ICUs). This review aimed to identify the AEs of PPE on HCWs working in ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A scoping review was conducted. MEDLINE, CINAHL, the World Health Organization (WHO) global literature on COVID-19, and Igaku-chuo-zasshi (a Japanese medical database), Google Scholar, medRxiv, and Health Research Board (HRB) open research were searched from January 25-28, 2021. The extracted data included author(s) name, year of publication, country, language, article title, journal name, publication type, study methodology, population, outcome, and key findings. Results: The initial search identified 691 articles and abstracts. Twenty-five articles were included in the analysis. The analysis comprised four key topics: studies focusing on PPE-related headache, voice disorders, skin manifestations, and miscellaneous AEs of PPE. The majority of AEs for HCWs in ICUs were induced by prolonged use of masks. Conclusion: The AEs of PPE among HCWs in ICUs included heat, headaches, skin injuries, chest discomfort, and dyspnea. Studies with a focus on specific diseases were on skin injuries. Moreover, many AEs were induced by prolonged use of masks.	Prevention
34282625	Impact of proactive low-molecular weight heparin therapy on outcomes in COVID-1. OBJECTIVES: Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may provide beneficial effects on outcomes of COVID-19. We aimed to examine the impact of LMWH treatment on clinical outcomes (duration of hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit, the requirement for mechanical ventilation, and death) of COVID-19 patients with normal D-dimer levels at admission. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) predisposes patients to arterial and venous thrombosis. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre and observational study we analysed the data of 308 confirmed COVID-19 patients with normal D-dimer levels at initial admission. After propensity score matching (PSM) patients were grouped; Group 1; patients who received LMWH with D-dimer </=0.5 mg/L, Group 2; patients who received LMWH after D-dimer levels exceeded 0.5 mg/L, and Group 3; patients who did not receive LMWH. RESULTS: After PSM, each group comprised 40 patients. The patients in Group1 had the best clinical outcomes compared to the other groups. Group 3 had the worst clinical outcomes (p<0.005). The benefit of LMWH increased with early prophylactic therapy especially when started while the D-dimer levels were </=0.5 mg/L. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest that proactive LMWH therapy improves clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients even with normal D-dimer levels (</= 0.5 mg/L) (Tab. 3, Fig. 2, Ref. 34).

34281177	Albumin Infusion in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: Hemodilution and Anticoagulation. Hypercoagulation is one of the major risk factors for ICU treatment, mechanical ventilation, and death in critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. At the same time, hypoalbuminemia is one risk factor in such patients, independent of age and comorbidities. Especially in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2-infection, albumin infusion may be essential to improve hemodynamics and to reduce the plasma level of the main marker of thromboembolism, namely, the D-dimer plasma level, as suggested by a recent report. Albumin is responsible for 80% of the oncotic pressure in the vessels. This is necessary to keep enough water within the systemic circulatory system and for the maintenance of sufficient blood pressure, as well as for sufficient blood supply for vital organs like the brain, lungs, heart, and kidney. The liver reacts to a decrease in oncotic pressure with an increase in albumin synthesis. This is normally possible through the use of amino acids from the proteins introduced with the nutrients reaching the portal blood. If these are not sufficiently provided with the diet, amino acids are delivered to the liver from muscular proteins by systemic circulation. The liver is also the source of coagulation proteins, such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, and most of the v WF VIII, which are physiological components of the extracellular matrix of the vessel wall. While albumin is the main negative acute-phase protein, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and v WF VIII are positive acute-phase proteins. Acute illnesses cause the activation of defense mechanisms (acute-phase reaction) that may lead to an increase of fibrinolysis and an increase of plasma level of fibrinogen breakdown products, mainly fibrin and D-dimer. The measurement of the plasma level of the D-dimer has been used as a marker for venous thromboembolism, where a fourfold increase of the D-dimer plasma level was used as a negative prognostic marker in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized patients. Increased fibrinolysis can take place in ischemic peripheral sites, where the mentioned coagulation proteins can become part of the provisional clot (e.g., in the lungs). Although critically ill SARS-CoV-2-infected patients are considered septic shock patients, albumin infusions have not been considered for hemodynamic resuscitation and as anticoagulants. The role of coagulation factors as provisional components of the extracellular matrix in case of generalized peripheral ischemia due to hypoalbuminemia and hypovolemia is discussed in this review.

34228870	Annexin A1 as a potential prognostic biomarker for COVID-19 disease: Case-control study. BACKGROUND: Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is an important endogenous glucocoticoid protein that contributes to the suppression of inflammation by limiting the production of neutrophil and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This study aims to determine the clinical predictivity value of blood AnxA1 levels in patients with mild and severe-critical pneumonia induced by COVID-19. METHODS: This study employed a prospective, case-control study design and was conducted at Ankara Training and Research hospital between 10 February 2021 and 15 March 2021. A total of 74 patients (42 of whom had moderate and 32 of whom had severe/critical cases of COVID-19 disease according to World Health Organization guidelines) and 50 nonsymptomatic healthy volunteers participated in the study. Blood samples were taken from patients at the time of hospital admission, after which serum was isolated. Following the isolation of serum, AnxA1 levels were evaluated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. RESULTS: The serum AnxA1 levels were measured as 25.5 (18.6-38.6) ng/ml in the control group, 21.2 (14.7-32) ng/ml in the moderate disease group, and 14.8 (9.7-26.8) ng/ml in the severe/critical disease group. Serum AnxA1 levels were significantly lower in the severe/critical disease group compared with the control and moderate disease groups (P = .01 and P = .0001, respectively). Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, a larger area under the curve (AUC) for the serum AnxA1 levels of the control group (AUC = 0.715, 95% CI = 0.626-0.803; P = .0001) was calculated compared with the COVID-19 patient group for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. The AnxA1 level was found to be 80% sensitive and 54.1% specific at a cut-off level of 18.5 ng/ml for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Moreover, the AnxA1 level was found to be 69.8% sensitive and 58.1% specific at a cut-off level of 17.2 ng/ml in predicting the need for intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. CONCLUSION: AnxA1 levels may be a beneficial biomarker in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and in predicting the need for ICU treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at the time of admission to the emergency department.

34218058	Direct-acting oral anticoagulants use prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and associations with 30-day clinical outcomes. BACKGROUND: It is unclear if direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) use before hospitalization due to COVID-19 diagnosis would potentially impact the severity and clinical outcomes thereafter. We compared 30-day hospitalization/re-hospitalization and clinical outcomes between patients on chronic DOAC therapy and patients not on oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy at time of COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: We used data from TriNetX, a global federated health research network. Patients aged >/=18 years who were treated with DOACs at time of COVID-19 diagnosis between 20 January 2020 and 28 February 2021 were included, and matched with patients not on OAC therapy from the same period. All patients were followed-up at 30-days after COVID-19 diagnosis. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, hospitalization/re-hospitalization, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). RESULTS: 738,423 patients were included. After propensity score matching (PSM), 26,006 patients remained in the study (13,003 on DOACs; 13,003 not on OAC). DOAC-treated patients (mean age 67.1 +/- 15.4 years, 52.2% male) had higher relative risks (RRs) and lower 30-days event-free survival as compared to patients not on OAC for all-cause mortality (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12-1.44; Log-Rank test p = 0.010), hospitalization/re-hospitalization (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.64-1.82; Log-Rank test p < 0.001) and VTE (RR 4.51, 95% CI 3.91-5.82; Log-Rank test p < 0.001), but not for ICH (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.54-1.51; Log-Rank test p = 0.513). CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients, previous DOAC therapy at time of diagnosis was not associated with improved clinical outcomes or lower hospitalization/re-hospitalization rate compared to patients not taking OAC therapy.

34284044	"The ROMANOV study found impaired humoral and cellular immune responses to SARSCov-2 mRNA vaccine in virus unexposed patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis. Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD), which are at high risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus and death due to COVID-19, have been prioritized for vaccination. However, because they were excluded from pivotal studies and have weakened immune responses, it is not known whether these patients are protected after the ""standard"" two doses of mRNA vaccines. To answer this, anti-spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and interferon gamma-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) specific-T cells were measured in the circulation 10-14 days after the second injection of BNT162b2 vaccine in 106 patients receiving MHD (14 with history of COVID-19) and compared to 30 healthy volunteers (four with history of COVID-19). After vaccination, most (72/80, 90%) patients receiving MHD naive for the virus generated at least one type of immune effector, but their response was weaker and less complete than that of healthy volunteers. In multivariate analysis, hemodialysis and immunosuppressive therapy were significantly associated with absence of both anti-RBD IgGs and anti-spike CD8(+) T cells. In contrast, previous history of COVID-19 in patients receiving MHD correlated with the generation of both types of immune effectors anti-RBD IgG and anti-spike CD8(+) T cells at levels similar to healthy volunteers. Patients receiving MHD naive for SARS-Cov-2 generate mitigated immune responses after two doses of mRNA vaccine. Thus, the good response to vaccine of patients receiving MHD with a history of COVID-19 suggest that these patients may benefit from a third vaccine injection."	Mechanism;Treatment
34208755	More Is Always Better Than One: The N-Terminal Domain of the Spike Protein as Another Emerging Target for Hampering the SARS-CoV-2 Attachment to Host Cells. Although the approved vaccines are proving to be of utmost importance in containing the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threat, they will hardly be resolutive as new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA virus) variants might be insensitive to the immune response they induce. In this scenario, developing an effective therapy is still a dire need. Different targets for therapeutic antibodies and diagnostics have been identified, among which the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, particularly its receptor-binding domain, has been defined as crucial. In this context, we aim to focus attention also on the role played by the S N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) in the virus attachment, already recognized as a valuable target for neutralizing antibodies, in particular, building on a cavity mapping indicating the presence of two druggable pockets and on the recent literature hypothesizing the presence of a ganglioside-binding domain. In this perspective, we aim at proposing S1-NTD as a putative target for designing small molecules hopefully able to hamper the SARS-CoV-2 attachment to host cells.	Mechanism;Treatment
34336597	Lack of N2-gene amplification on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay and potential novel causative mutations: A case series from Auckland, New Zealand. We describe three cases with viral strains that demonstrate impaired N2-gene detection on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, with two previously undescribed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): C29197T and G29227T. We propose that these SNPs are likely responsible since they are in close proximity to the previously described C29200T/C29200A SNPs, already shown to abolish N2-gene detection by the Xpert assay. Whether these SNPs abolish N2-gene detection by the Xpert assay individually or only in combination requires more work to elucidate.	Case Report
34211935	Severity and mortality of COVID-19 infection in HIV-infected individuals: Preliminary findings from Iran. Background: Higher mortality due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is reported among some immunocompromised patients; however, the relation between immunosuppression due to HIV infection and severity of COVID-19 infection remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the severity and mortality of COVID-19 infection in HIV-infected patients. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study on all COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases hospitlized in Iran between Febuary 19 (epidemic onset date) and April 8, 2020, whose data were recorded in the national database for Medical Care Monitoring Center. Hospitalized patients were followed from admittion to death/discharge. Patients' HIV status was recorded based on their self report. Logistic and Cox regression models were used to evaluate the association between HIV infection and the severity (according to the Glascow-Coma Scale situation, need for intubation and hypoxemia) and mortality of COVID-19 infection, respectively. Analyses were performed separately for COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases. Results: Out of 122 206 severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases, 90 were HIV-positive (0.07%), with a similar mean age (Pt-test= 0.750) and distrubtion of gender (PChi-square= 0.887) and nationality (PChi-square= 0.202) as HIV-negative patients. A comparable proportion of HIV-positive and HIV-negative cases were tested for COVID-19 (p= 0.170); however, the frequency of positive results was lower among HIV-positives (p= 0.038). The frequency of COVID-19 and HIV coinfection was lower than expected among confirmed cases (adjusted OR= 0.54; 95% CI: 0.29-1.02) and suspected cases (adjusted OR= 0.68; 95% CI: 0.45- 1.02), which means that the frequency of COVID-19 infection was lower among HIV-positive cases. HIV infection decreased the risk of death among confirmed (adjusted HR= 0.33; 95% CI: 0.05-2.32), suspected cases (adjusted HR= 0.81; 95% CI: 0.33-1.94), and among SARI cases (adjusted HR= 0.73; 95% CI: 0.35-1.54). Conclusion: Our findings support the concept that HIV infection was not a risk factor to increase the severity and risk of death among COVID-19 infected patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34201973	"Redefining the Relationship: Palliative Care in Critical Perinatal and Neonatal Cardiac Patients. Patients with perinatal and neonatal congenital heart disease (CHD) represent a unique population with higher morbidity and mortality compared to other neonatal patient groups. Despite an overall improvement in long-term survival, they often require chronic care of complex medical illnesses after hospital discharge, placing a high burden of responsibility on their families. Emerging literature reflects high levels of depression and anxiety which plague parents, starting as early as the time of prenatal diagnosis. In the current era of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the additive nature of significant stressors for both medical providers and families can have catastrophic consequences on communication and coping. Due to the high prognostic uncertainty of CHD, data suggests that early pediatric palliative care (PC) consultation may improve shared decision-making, communication, and coping, while minimizing unnecessary medical interventions. However, barriers to pediatric PC persist largely due to the perception that PC consultation is indicative of ""giving up."" This review serves to highlight the evolving landscape of perinatal and neonatal CHD and the need for earlier and longitudinal integration of pediatric PC in order to provide high-quality, interdisciplinary care to patients and families."

34222281	The Risk of COVID-19 Related Hospitalsation, Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality in People With Underlying Asthma or COPD: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Background: Several underlying diseases have been associated with unfavorable COVID-19 related outcomes including asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), however few studies have reported risks that are adjusted for confounding variables. This study aimed to examine the adjusted risk of COVID-19 related hospitalsation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality in patients with vs. without asthma or COPD. Methods: A systematic review of major databases was undertaken for studies published between 1/12/2019 and 19/4/2021. Studies reporting the adjusted (for one or more confounder) risks of either hospitalsation, ICU admission, or mortality in asthmatics or COPD patients (control group = no asthma or no COPD) were identified. Risk of bias was determined via the QUIPS tool. A random effect meta-analysis was undertaken. Findings: 37 studies were eligible for analysis, with a total of 1,678,992 participants. The pooled ORs of COVID-19 hospitalsation in subjects with asthma and COPD was 0.91 (95% CI 0.76-1.09) and 1.37 (95% CI 1.29-1.46), respectively. For ICU admission, OR in subjects with asthma and COPD was 0.89 (95% CI 0.74-1.07) and 1.22 (95% CI 1.04-1.42), respectively. For mortality, ORs were 0.88 (95% CI 0.77-1.01) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.08-1.34) for asthma and COPD, respectively. Further, the pooled risk of mortality as measured via Cox regression was 0.93 (95% CI 0.87-1.00) for asthma and 1.30 (95% CI 1.17-1.44) for COPD. All of these findings were of a moderate level of certainty. Interpretation: COPD was significantly associated with COVID-19 related hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality. Asthma was not associated with negative COVID-19 related health outcomes. Individuals with COPD should take precautions to limit the risk of COVID-19 exposure to negate these potential outcomes. Limitations include differing population types and adjustment for differing cofounding variables. Practitioners should note these findings when dealing with patients with these comorbidities.

34344351	Decreased human respiratory syncytial virus activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: an ecological time-series analysis. BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as sanitary measures and travel restrictions, aimed at controlling the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), may affect the transmission dynamics of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). We aimed to quantify the contribution of the sales of hand hygiene products and the number of international and domestic airline passenger arrivals on HRSV epidemic in Japan. METHODS: The monthly number of HRSV cases per sentinel site (HRSV activity) in 2020 was compared with the average of the corresponding period in the previous 6 years (from January 2014 to December 2020) using a monthly paired t-test. A generalized linear gamma regression model was used to regress the time-series of the monthly HRSV activity against NPI indicators, including sale of hand hygiene products and the number of domestic and international airline passengers, while controlling for meteorological conditions (monthly average temperature and relative humidity) and seasonal variations between years (2014-2020). RESULTS: The average number of monthly HRSV case notifications in 2020 decreased by approximately 85% (p < 0.001) compared to those in the preceding 6 years (2014-2019). For every average yen1 billion (approximately pound680,000/$9,000,000) spent on hand hygiene products during the current month and 1 month before there was a 0.29% (p = 0.003) decrease in HRSV infections. An increase of average 1000 domestic and international airline passenger arrivals during the previous 1-2 months was associated with a 3.8 x 10(- 4)% (p < 0.001) and 1.2 x 10(- 3)% (p < 0.001) increase in the monthly number of HRSV infections, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that there is an association between the decrease in the monthly number of HRSV cases and improved hygiene and sanitary measures and travel restrictions for COVID-19 in Japan, indicating that these public health interventions can contribute to the suppression of HRSV activity. These findings may help in public health policy and decision making.	Prevention
34288044	COVID-19 vaccine-associated cerebral venous thrombosis in Germany. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the incidence of cerebral sinus and venous thrombosis (CVT) within one month from first-dose administration and the frequency of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) as the underlying mechanism after vaccination with BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and mRNA-1273, in Germany. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was e-mailed to all Departments of Neurology. We asked to report cases of CVT within one month of a COVID-19 vaccination. Other cerebral events could also be reported. Incidence rates of CVT were calculated by using official statistics of nine German States. RESULTS: A total of 45 CVT cases were reported. In addition, 9 primary ischemic strokes, 4 primary intracerebral hemorrhages, and 4 other neurological events were recorded. Of the CVT patients, 35 (77.8%) were female, and 36 (80.0%) were below the age of 60 years. Fifty-three events were observed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 (85.5%), 9 after BNT162b2 (14.5%), and none after mRNA-1273 vaccination. After 7,126,434 first vaccine doses, the incidence rate of CVT within one month from first dose administration was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.38-0.78) per 100,000 person-months (which corresponds to a risk of CVT within the first 31 days of 0.55 per 100,000 individuals) for all vaccines and 1.52 (1.00-2.21) for ChAdOx1 (after 2,320,535 ChAdOx1 first doses). The adjusted incidence rate ratio was 9.68 (3.46-34.98) for ChAdOx1 compared to mRNA-based vaccines and 3.14 (1.22-10.65) for women compared to non-women. In 26/45 patients with CVT (57.8%), VITT was graded highly probable. INTERPRETATION: Given an incidence of 0.02-0.15 per 100,000 person-months for CVT in the general population, these findings point towards a higher risk for CVT after ChAdOx1 vaccination, especially for women.

34213977	Evaluation of a rapid antigen test to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify potentially infectious individuals. The identification and isolation of highly infectious SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals is an important public health strategy. Rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) are promising candidates for large-scale screenings due to timely results and feasibility for on-site testing. Nonetheless, the diagnostic performance of RADT in detecting infectious individuals is yet to be fully determined. In this study, RT-qPCR and virus culture of RT-qPCR positive samples were used to evaluate and compare the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Test in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infected and possibly infectious individuals. To this end, two combined oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at a routine SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic center. A total of 2,028 samples were tested and 118 virus cultures inoculated. SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 210 samples by RT-qPCR, representing a positive rate of 10.36%. The Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Test yielded a positive result in 92 (4.54%) samples resulting in an overall sensitivity and specificity of 42.86% and 99.89%. For adjusted Ct values <20 (n=14), <25 (n=57), and <30 (n=88) the RADT reached sensitivities of 100%, 98.25%, and 88.64%, respectively. All 29 culture positive samples were detected by RADT. While overall sensitivity was low, Standard Q COVID-19 RADT reliably detected patients with high RNA loads. Additionally, negative RADT results fully corresponded with the lack of viral cultivability in Vero E6 cells. These results indicate that RADT can be a valuable tool for the detection of individuals that are likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2. RADT testing could therefore guide public health testing strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.	Diagnosis
34284918	Imaging of Multisystem Inflammatory Disease in Children (MIS-C) Associated With COVID-19. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively evaluate imaging findings in multisystem inflammatory disease in children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The radiological imaging findings of 45 pediatric patients aged between 52 days and 16 years, who were diagnosed with MIS-C according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, were evaluated. All the patients underwent chest X-ray and echocardiography. The findings obtained from 25 abdominal radiographs, 24 abdominal US, 7 abdominal CT, 16 thorax CT, 21 cranial MRI and one spinal MRI, MR cholangiography (MRCP) and cardiac MRI examinations were categorized and evaluated according to the affected systems. RESULTS: While the most common findings in chest X-ray were perihilar opacity and peribronchial thickening, pleural effusion was the most finding in thorax CT. Echocardiography findings of myocarditis were observed in 31% of the cases. The most common findings in abdominal radiological evaluation were hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, edema in the gallbladder wall and periportal area, mesenteric lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant, thickening of the intestinal walls, and free fluid. Reversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) was the most common neurological finding. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like lesions, acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalomyelitis, and radiological findings consistent with Guillain-Barre syndrome were found in one case each. CONCLUSION: Radiological findings seen in MIS-C in pediatric cases are correlated with the affected system. According to the system involved, there is no specific finding for this disease. Radiological findings are not the primary diagnostic tool but can assist in the evaluation of the affected systems and to guide treatment.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34219196	The role of teledentistry in oral cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: an integrative literature review. OBJECTIVES: This integrative review aimed to assess the benefits of the use of teledentistry for patients undergoing treatment of oral and head and neck cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched in PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, Lilacs, Embase, Open Grey, Google Scholar, and Jstor databases for studies referring to the management, control, and assistance, through teledentistry, to patients with oral and head and neck cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We found 356 references in the databases, 209 after duplicates removal, 23 met criteria for full-text reading, and 11 studies were included for qualitative synthesis, in four categories: virtual visits, use of remote technology, patient's satisfaction, multidisciplinary approach in teledentistry. We found that 78% of patients currently preferred teledentistry; 92% of patients would recommend the use of video consultation to other patients. The continuity of dental care, the reduction of patient visits to the hospital, the reduction of the risk of infection with the coronavirus, and limitation of face-to-face consultations to protect health professionals are benefits that reinforce the use of teledentistry by health institutions. Two studies showed patients' satisfaction with the use of teledentistry in monitoring cancer patients and showed an improvement in quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The teledentistry, as a remote technology for monitoring patients with oral and head and neck cancer, is well accepted by patients in preliminary studies. Although these studies pointed out some benefits of using remote technologies for the care of cancer patients, further robust scientific evidence is still needed in this regard.	Prevention
34349563	Delayed Breast Cancer Detection in an Asian Country (Taiwan) with Low COVID-19 Incidence. Purpose: To assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic delayed breast cancer diagnosis in Taiwan, an Asian country with a low COVID-19 incidence. Methods: The monthly volume of breast biopsies and breast cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic (during January 21 and July 31, 2020) was compared to the same period in 2019 (pre-COVID-19). Results: Taiwan recorded a lower COVID-19 incidence rate (20.2 cases per million population) than other Asian countries. The screen-detected lesions accounted for 55% and 36% of 2019 and 2020 total biopsied lesions, respectively. Total breast biopsy, mammography-guided, and ultrasound-guided biopsies decreased by 17%, 23%, and 14%, respectively, from pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19. Monthly differences were significant in total biopsy (p=0.03), mammography-guided biopsy (p=0.04), and a benign pathology result after breast biopsy (p<0.01). Nearly 46% decline was noted in the biopsy results of non-invasive breast cancer in 2020. The number of total breast cancers and early breast cancers (stages 0 and 1) decreased by 10% and 38%, respectively, during pandemic. Individuals with early breast cancer accounted for 71% and 49% of the total diagnosed breast cancer in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion: The pandemic significantly delayed early breast cancer detection in Taiwan despite low COVID-19 incidence. Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04750018.	Prevention

34226141	[Cardiac rehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany - a quick poll of the German Society of rehabilitation and Prevention of Heart and Circulation Diseases (DGPR)]. BACKGROUND: In Germany, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed cardiological care in both the outpatient and inpatient setting, including the cancellation of elective interventions. The investigation presented here was carried out in order to obtain information on the extent to which this also applies to cardiac rehabilitation facilities. METHODS: In August 2020, all 107 member institutions of the DGPR were contacted and asked to take part in an online survey containing 12 sets of questions on the topic. RESULTS: At end of August, data were available from 45 institutions. 31.1 % of the institutions surveyed rehabilitated patients with cardiac complications/manifestations of COVID-19 disease, mainly after acute coronary syndrome (29.6 %) and pulmonary artery embolism (25.9 %). More than 40 % of the facilities were required to close down partially or completely, and 14 % feared a partial or complete closure by the end of 2020. The costs for testing, if SARS-CoV-2 infection was suspected (72.1 %), were mainly borne by the rehabilitation facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of a short-term data collection and a response rate of approx. 45 %, the present study gives indications of the challenging situation of the COVID-19 pandemic for cardiological rehabilitation facilities in Germany.

34216553	Decreased Mortality Over Time During the First Wave in Patients With COVID-19 in Geriatric Care: Data From the Stockholm GeroCovid Study. OBJECTIVE: To describe temporal changes in treatment, care, and short-term mortality outcomes of geriatric patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Altogether 1785 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 6744 hospitalized for non-COVID-19 causes at 7 geriatric clinics in Stockholm from March 6 to July 31, 2020, were included. METHODS: Across admission month, patient vital signs and pharmacological treatment in relationship to risk for in-hospital death were analyzed using the Poisson regression model. Incidence rates (IRs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of death are presented. RESULTS: In patients with COVID-19, the IR of mortality were 27%, 17%, 10%, 8%, and 2% from March to July, respectively, after standardization for demographics and vital signs. Compared with patients admitted in March, the risk of in-hospital death decreased by 29% [IRR 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.99] in April, 61% (0.39, 0.26-0.58) in May, 68% (0.32, 0.19-0.55) in June, and 86% (0.14, 0.03-0.58) in July. The proportion of patients admitted for geriatric care with oxygen saturation <90% decreased from 13% to 1%, which partly explains the improvement of COVID-19 patient survival. In non-COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, mortality rates remained relatively stable (IR 1.3%-2.3%). Compared with non-COVID-19 geriatric patients, the IRR of death declined from 11 times higher (IRR 11.7, 95% CI 6.11-22.3) to 1.6 times (2.61, 0.50-13.7) between March and July in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Mortality risk in geriatric patients from the Stockholm region declined over time throughout the first pandemic wave of COVID-19. The improved survival rate over time was only partly related to improvement in saturation status at the admission of the patients hospitalized later throughout the pandemic. Lower incidence during the later months could have led to less severe hospitalized cases driving down mortality.	Treatment
34281922	Predicting mortality of individual patients with COVID-19: a multicentre Dutch cohort. OBJECTIVE: Develop and validate models that predict mortality of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A multicentre cohort across 10 Dutch hospitals including patients from 27 February to 8 June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (age >/=18) admitted to the hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 21-day all-cause mortality evaluated by the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. The predictive value of age was explored by comparison with age-based rules used in practice and by excluding age from the analysis. RESULTS: 2273 patients were included, of whom 516 had died or discharged to palliative care within 21 days after admission. Five feature sets, including premorbid, clinical presentation and laboratory and radiology values, were derived from 80 features. Additionally, an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)-based data-driven feature selection selected the 10 features with the highest F values: age, number of home medications, urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, oxygen saturation (%), oxygen saturation is measured on room air, oxygen saturation is measured on oxygen therapy, blood gas pH and history of chronic cardiac disease. A linear logistic regression and non-linear tree-based gradient boosting algorithm fitted the data with an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.85) and 0.82 (0.79 to 0.85), respectively, using the 10 selected features. Both models outperformed age-based decision rules used in practice (AUC of 0.69, 0.65 to 0.74 for age >70). Furthermore, performance remained stable when excluding age as predictor (AUC of 0.78, 0.75 to 0.81). CONCLUSION: Both models showed good performance and had better test characteristics than age-based decision rules, using 10 admission features readily available in Dutch hospitals. The models hold promise to aid decision-making during a hospital bed shortage.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34291123	The Trend of Health Service Utilization and Challenges Faced During the COVID-19 Pandemic at Primary Units in Addis Ababa: A Mixed-Methods Study. Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed an extraordinary challenge to the health and socio-economic facet of nations globally. Health facilities have encountered tremendous challenges to contain service delivery at all levels. This study aims to assess the trend of health service utilization and challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic at primary units in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Method: A multi-facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Addis Ababa between 1 and 30 of August 2020. A mixed-methods design was employed, and both quantitative and qualitative data were collected at 5 health centers. Facilities were selected randomly from 5 sub-cities while interviewees were recruited purposively. A structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data from the HMIS units of each facility. Qualitative data was collected using a semi-structured key-informant interview guide. Quantitative data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel, and a 10-month time-series trend was generated. For the qualitative data, qualitative data analysis (QDA-minor) software was used. Results: Time-series comparison of the pre-COVID-19 era loads with the COVID-19 period showed that there was an extensive disparity in the service delivery capacity of the health facilities. A huge drop in inpatient flow of some units such as PICT, VCT, FP services, and most sub-units of the OPDs has been recorded following the COVID-19 outbreak. The key-informant interview also revealed that such challenges, as fear of infection and stigma, poor infrastructure, challenges related to human resources, and challenges related to the supply of prevention and treatment inputs were prominently encountered at the health centers. Conclusion: The COVID-19 wave has negatively impacted many service delivery points in the study settings. The presence of weak infrastructure, lack of PPEs, fear of the infection and stigma, and staff workload have been mentioned as the predominant challenges faced during the outbreak. Health authorities should arrange multifaceted supports to ensure uninterrupted service delivery at primary healthcare units.	Prevention
34216281	Alternative Strategies for the Estimation of a Disease's Basic Reproduction Number: A Model-Agnostic Study. This work presents a model-agnostic evaluation of four different models that estimate a disease's basic reproduction number. The evaluation presented is twofold: first, the theory behind each of the models is reviewed and compared; then, each model is tested with eight impartial simulations. All scenarios were constructed in an experimental framework that allows each model to fulfill its assumptions and hence, obtain unbiased results for each case. Among these models is the one proposed by Thompson et al. (Epidemics 29:100356, 2019), i.e., a Bayesian estimation method well established in epidemiological practice. The other three models include a novel state-space method and two simulation-based approaches based on a Poisson infection process. The advantages and flaws of each model are discussed from both theoretical and practical standpoints. Finally, we present the evolution of Covid-19 outbreak in Colombia as a case study for computing the basic reproduction number with each one of the reviewed methods.	Epidemic Forecasting
34208115	How SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic Changed Traumatology and Hospital Setting: An Analysis of 498 Fractured Patients. BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is one of the biggest challenges for many health systems in the world, making lots of them overwhelmed by the enormous pressure to manage patients. We reported our Institutional Experience, with specific aims to describe the distribution and type of treated injuries, and the organizational setup of our hospital. METHODS: Data of fractured patients admitted for surgical treatment in the time frames 9 March 2020-4 May 2020 and 1 March 2019-31 May 2019 were collected and compared. Furthermore, surgery duration and some parameters of effectiveness in health management were compared. RESULTS: A total of 498 patients were included. Mean age significantly lower age in 2019 and femoral fractures were significantly more frequent 2020. Mean surgery time was significantly longer in 2020. Mortality rate difference between the two years was found to be statistically significant. Time interval between diagnosis and surgery and between diagnosis and discharge/decease was significantly lower in 2020. In 2020, no patient admitted with a negative swab turned positive in any of the following tests for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has modified the epidemiology of hospitalized patients for traumatic reasons, leading to an increased admission of older patients with femoral fractures. Nevertheless, our institutional experience showed that an efficient change in the hospital organization, with an improvement of several parameters of effectiveness in health management, led to a null infection rate between patients.

34373809	Case Report of a Saga of Post-COVID-19 Complications. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID--19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is characterized by symptoms such as fever, sore throat, cough, fatigue, myalgias, headache, diarrhea, and dysgeusia. In a majority of the cases, it causes mild illness. However, in severe cases, the virus activates the immune system causing systemic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and pro-thrombotic state leading to various complications. Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure are frequent complications. However, even in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, our knowledge of its myriad clinical features and complications is still incomplete and continues to evolve. Here, we present the case of a patient who developed several complications post-COVID-19 one after the other. He was admitted with severe COVID-19 for which he received standard COVID-19 treatment and mechanical ventilation. In the post-COVID-19 state extending up to six months, he serially developed deep vein thrombosis, endogenous endophthalmitis, empyema, and post-inflammatory arthritis of the hip joints. To our knowledge, such a case has not been reported earlier in the literature.	Case Report
34368648	Immunogenicity and Protective Efficacy of an Intranasal Live-attenuated Vaccine Against SARS-CoV-2. Global deployment of an effective and safe vaccine is necessary to curtail the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we evaluated a Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-based vectored-vaccine in mice and hamsters for its immunogenicity, safety and protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal administration of recombinant (r)NDV-S vaccine expressing spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 to mice induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG2a antibodies and T cell-mediated immunity. Hamsters immunised with two doses of vaccine showed complete protection from lung infection, inflammation, and pathological lesions following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Importantly, administration of two doses of intranasal rNDV-S vaccine significantly reduced the SARS-CoV-2 shedding in nasal turbinate and lungs in hamsters. Collectively, intranasal vaccination has the potential to control infection at the site of inoculation, which should prevent both clinical disease and virus transmission to halt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

34284643	A survey on patients' disease perception and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on persons living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Malaysia. Aim: To investigate the patients' perception of their disease, its management and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on persons living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Malaysia. Patients & methods: An online survey comprising 42 questions was conducted on ALS patients during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Responses were received from 37/60 (62%) participants with ALS directly or through their caregivers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, two-thirds of patients were negatively impacted by the sudden disruption to their hospital appointments, rehabilitation sessions and reduced social interactions. Conclusion: This study provided insight into patients' perception of their care and management of ALS in Malaysia which will facilitate in implementing changes that can improve care to persons living with this devastating illness.

34292321	Quantifying Viral Particle Aerosolization Risk During Tracheostomy Surgery and Tracheostomy Care. Importance: During respiratory disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, aerosol-generating procedures, including tracheostomy, are associated with the risk of viral transmission to health care workers. Objective: To quantify particle aerosolization during tracheostomy surgery and tracheostomy care and to evaluate interventions that minimize the risk of viral particle exposure. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study was conducted from August 2020 to January 2021 at a tertiary care academic institution. Aerosol generation was measured in real time with an optical particle counter during simulated (manikin) tracheostomy surgical and clinical conditions, including cough, airway nebulization, open suctioning, and electrocautery. Aerosol sampling was also performed during in vivo swine tracheostomy procedures (n = 4), with or without electrocautery. Fluorescent dye was used to visualize cough spread onto the surgical field during swine tracheostomy. Finally, 6 tracheostomy coverings were compared with no tracheostomy covering to quantify reduction in particle aerosolization. Main Outcomes and Measures: Respirable aerosolized particle concentration. Results: Cough, airway humidification, open suctioning, and electrocautery produced aerosol particles substantially above baseline. Compared with uncovered tracheostomy, decreased aerosolization was found with the use of tracheostomy coverings, including a cotton mask (73.8% [(95% CI, 63.0%-84.5%]; d = 3.8), polyester gaiter 79.5% [95% CI, 68.7%-90.3%]; d = 7.2), humidification mask (82.8% [95% CI, 72.0%-93.7%]; d = 8.6), heat moisture exchanger (HME) (91.0% [95% CI, 80.2%-101.7%]; d = 19.0), and surgical mask (89.9% [95% CI, 79.3%-100.6%]; d = 12.8). Simultaneous use of a surgical mask and HME decreased the particle concentration compared with either the HME (95% CI, 1.6%-12.3%; Cohen d = 1.2) or surgical mask (95% CI, 2.7%-13.2%; d = 1.9) used independently. Procedures performed with electrocautery increased total aerosolized particles by 1500 particles/m3 per 5-second interval (95% CI, 1380-1610 particles/m3 per 5-second interval; d = 1.8). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this laboratory and animal comparative effectiveness study indicate that tracheostomy surgery and tracheostomy care are associated with significant aerosol generation, putting health care workers at risk for viral transmission of airborne diseases. Combined HME and surgical mask coverage of the tracheostomy was associated with decreased aerosolization, thereby reducing the risk of viral transmission to health care workers.	Prevention
34219277	Hemoadsorption for management of patients on veno-venous ECMO support for severe COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop a profound cytokine-mediated pro-inflammatory response. This study reports outcomes in 10 patients with COVID-19 supported on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) who were selected for the emergency use of a hemoadsorption column integrated in the ECMO circuit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre and posttreatment, clinical data, and inflammatory markers were assessed to determine the safety and feasibility of using this system and to evaluate the clinical effect. RESULTS: During hemoadsorption, median levels of interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-10 decreased by 54%, 86%, and 64%, respectively. Reductions in other markers were observed for lactate dehydrogenase (-49%), ferritin (-46%), d-dimer (-7%), C-reactive protein (-55%), procalcitonin (-76%), and lactate (-44%). Vasoactive-inotrope scores decreased significantly over the treatment interval (-80%). The median hospital length of stay was 53 days (36-85) and at 90-days post cannulation, survival was 90% which was similar to a group of patients without the use of hemoadsorption. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of hemoadsorption to VV-ECMO in patients with severe COVID-19 is feasible and reduces measured cytokine levels. However, in this small series, the precise impact on the overall clinical course and survival benefit still remains unknown.	Treatment
34208425	The Deleterious Effects of COVID-19 in the Peripartum Period: A Case Report. While the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to wreak havoc across the nation and the globe as one of the most significant global health crises of our time, recent attention has been turned to the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy and the puerperium. Although most cases have been asymptomatic, for some patients, the disease may be accompanied by serious complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, multi organ failure, and death. Several case studies have noted that patients with co-morbidities are at a significant risk of these complications. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, authors conclude that cardiovascular disease was associated with increased composite poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. The following case report highlights the multi-system complications and severity of symptoms that can take place after childbirth in a patient with co-morbid obstetric and prenatal conditions and an initially asymptomatic COVID-19 infection.

34201684	COVID-19 and the Gaping Wounds of South Africa's Suboptimal Immunisation Coverage: An Implementation Research Imperative for Assessing and Addressing Missed Opportunities for Vaccination. Despite South Africa's substantial investments in and efforts at ensuring universal access to immunisation services, progress has stalled and remains suboptimal across provinces and districts. An additional challenge is posed by the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has disrupted immunisation services globally, including in South Africa. While there is growing evidence that missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV) are a major contributor to suboptimal immunisation progress globally, not much is known about the burden and determinants of MOV in the South African context. Herein, we make a case for assessing MOV as a strategy to address current immunisation coverage gaps while mitigating the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on immunisation services. We illustrate a practical implementation research approach to assessing the burden of MOV among children in primary care settings; for understanding the factors associated with MOV; and for designing, implementing, and evaluating context-appropriate quality improvement interventions for addressing missed opportunities. Such efforts are vital for building health system resilience and maintaining immunisation programme capacity to optimally deliver essential health services such as routine childhood immunisation, even during pandemics.

34198530	Modeling within-Host SARS-CoV-2 Infection Dynamics and Potential Treatments. The goal of this study was to develop a mathematical model to simulate the actions of drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. To accomplish that goal, we have developed a mathematical model that describes the control of a SARS-CoV-2 infection by the innate and adaptive immune components. Invasion of the virus triggers the innate immunity, whereby interferon renders some of the target cells resistant to infection, and infected cells are removed by effector cells. The adaptive immune response is represented by plasma cells and virus-specific antibodies. The model is parameterized and then validated against viral load measurements collected in COVID-19 patients. We apply the model to simulate three potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies: (1) Remdesivir, a repurposed drug that has been shown to inhibit the transcription of SARS-CoV-2, (2) an alternative (hypothetical) therapy that inhibits the virus' entry into host cells, and (3) convalescent plasma transfusion therapy. Simulation results point to the importance of early intervention, i.e., for any of the three therapies to be effective, it must be administered sufficiently early, not more than a day or two after the onset of symptoms. The model can serve as a key component in integrative platforms for rapid in silico testing of potential COVID-19 therapies and vaccines.	Mechanism;Treatment
34283860	The early detection of immunoglobulins via optical-based lateral flow immunoassay platform in COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the global public health challenge currently persisting at a grand scale. A method that meets the rapid quantitative detection of antibodies to assess the body's immune response from natural COVID-19 illness or vaccines' effects is urgently needed. In the present study, an attempt was made to integrate a newly designed spectrometer to the COVID-19 test strip procedure; this augmentation provides the quantitative capacity to a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). Optical interpretation of results by quantitative alpha index, rather than visual qualification, can be done quickly, in 5-10 minutes. The developed product was compared with several other serological IgM/IgG antibody reagents on the market by recruiting 111 participants suspected of having COVID-19 infection from March to May 2020 in a hospital. Taking RT-PCR as the diagnostic gold standard, the quantitative spectral LIFA platform could correctly detect all 12 COVID-19 patients. Concerning RT-PCR negative patients, all three antibody testing methods found positive cases. The optical-based platform exhibited the ability of early detection of immunoglobulins of RT-PCR negative patients. There was an apparent trend that elevation of IgM levels in the acute phase of infection; then IgG levels rose later. It exhibited the risk of a false-negative diagnosis of RT-PCR in COVID-19 testing. The significant detection ability of this new optical-based platform demonstrated clinical potential.	Diagnosis
34198792	Efficacy and Safety of Hydroxychloroquine for Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. We systematically reviewed the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine as treatment for hospitalized COVID-19. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating hydroxychloroquine as treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients were searched until 2nd of December 2020. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, need of mechanical ventilation, need of non-invasive ventilation, ICU admission and oxygen support at 14 and 30 days. Secondary outcomes were clinical recovery and worsening, discharge, radiological progression of pneumonia, virologic clearance, serious adverse events (SAE) and adverse events. Inverse variance random effects meta-analyses were performed. Thirteen RCTs (n=18,540) were included. Hydroxychloroquine total doses ranged between 2000 and 12,400 mg; treatment durations were from 5 to 16 days and follow up times between 5 and 30 days. Compared to controls, hydroxychloroquine non-significantly increased mortality at 14 days (RR 1.07, 95%CI 0.92-1.25) or 30 days (RR 1.08, 95%CI 1.00-1.16). Hydroxychloroquine did not affect other primary or secondary outcomes, except SAEs that were significantly higher than the control (RR 1.24, 95%CI 1.05-1.46). Eleven RCTs had high or some concerns of bias. Subgroup analyses were consistent with main analyses. Hydroxychloroquine was not efficacious for treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients and caused more severe adverse events. Hydroxychloroquine should not be recommended as treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.	Treatment
34363871	Introduction of the BNT162b2 vaccine during a COVID-19 nursing home outbreak. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks often occur in nursing homes and prompt frequent surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2. A single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine reduces viral load and transmission. In this study, we describe the real-world efficacy of BNT162b2 single-dose vaccination during a COVID-19 outbreak at a Veterans Affairs Community Living Center (CLC). METHODS: From 12/2/20-5/14/21, twice weekly antigen testing was used to detect COVID-19 among 146 residents at the CLC. Residents without a prior history of COVID-19 who agreed to immunization were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine on 12/16/20 and 1/6/21. Single-dose vaccine efficacy was determined for days 1-21 and days 14-21 after the first vaccine dose. RESULTS: The outbreak occurred from 12/2/20-1/7/21 with an attack rate of 30.8% (45/146); 46.7% (21/45) of the cases were due to asymptomatic COVID-19. One unit accounted for 77.8% (35/45) of the cases. In the vaccine analysis, 116 residents were a median age of 74.5 years and 93.1% (108/116) had >/= 1 comorbid condition. Between the first and second dose, 15.5% (15/97) of vaccinated residents, and 21.2% (4/19) of unvaccinated residents developed COVID-19 (p=0.81). One week after the second dose, no cases of COVID-19 occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Albeit limited by the small numbers, a single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine was not efficacious at preventing COVID-19 during this nursing home outbreak.	Treatment
34219466	Age and Acute Ischemic Stroke Outcome in North American Patients With COVID-19. Background Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the context of COVID-19 has received considerable attention for its propensity to affect patients of all ages. We aimed to evaluate the effect of age on functional outcome and mortality following an acute ischemic event. Methods and Results A prospectively maintained database from comprehensive stroke centers in Canada and the United States was analyzed for patients with AIS from March 14 to September 30, 2020 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The primary outcome was Modified Rankin Scale score at discharge, and the secondary outcome was mortality. Baseline characteristics, laboratory values, imaging, and thrombectomy workflow process times were assessed. Among all 126 patients with COVID-19 who were diagnosed with AIS, the median age was 63 years (range, 27-94). There were 35 (27.8%) patients with AIS in the aged </=55 years group, 47 (37.3%) in the aged 56 to 70 group, and 44 (34.9%) in the aged >70 group. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and thrombectomy rates were comparable across these groups, (P=0.331 and 0.212, respectively). There was a significantly lower rate of mortality between each group favoring younger age (21.9% versus 45.0% versus 48.8%, P=0.047). After multivariable adjustment for possible confounders, a 1-year increase in age was significantly associated with fewer instances of a favorable outcome of Modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2 (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95 CI%, 0.90-0.99; P=0.048) and higher mortality (OR, 1.06; 95 CI%, 1.02-1.10; P=0.007). Conclusions AIS in the context of COVID-19 affects young patients at much greater rates than pre-pandemic controls. Nevertheless, instances of poor functional outcome and mortality are closely tied to increasing age.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34219707	New safer management for breast cancer patients who need neoadjuvant therapy during SARS-COVID pandemic. During the first hit of SARS-COVID pandemic, an important reorganization of Healthcare Services has been done, and new protocols and pathways to protect frails patients as oncological patients were designed. The second hit of pandemic had stressed these new pathways and suggest to health-workers some improvements for safer management of patents.We reported our experience in organizing the clinical pathway of neoadjuvant therapy candidate patients based on the execution of sentinel lympho-node biopsy and the placement of implantable venous access port in the same access to operating room before neoadjuvant chemotherapy suggesting a possible organizational model. In the period October-December 2020 we have included in this new type of path twelve patients and we have not registered any cases of COVID among the patients included. We think this new path, adopted amid the second hit, will be useful for all Breast Units that are facing the challenge of guaranteeing the highest standards of care in a historical moment where the health emergency occupies the efforts of health workers and the economic resources of health systems.

34201923	Comparing Infection Profiles of Expectant Mothers with COVID-19 and Impacts on Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes between the First Two Waves of the Pandemic. During 2020, Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) incidence fluctuated in two clear waves across the spring and autumn periods. This study was designed to compare the maternal and perinatal clinical outcomes in obstetrics patients with COVID-19 between the two waves of infection in Spain. We conducted an observational, analytical, ambispective cohort study with longitudinal follow-up of mothers with confirmed SARV-CoV-2 infection from different hospitals in our country between March-November 2020. We recruited 1295 pregnant women with SARS-CoV2 infection from 78 hospitals, 846 (65.3%) of whom were diagnosed during the first wave and 449 (34.7%) during the second wave. Our results show that patients developing COVID-19 during the first wave had more symptoms at triage, early in pregnancy with greater rates of COVID-19-related maternal morbidity; caesarean section and preterm birth in the first wave. We register two cases of maternal mortality and only during the first wave. Maternal morbidity events showed a strong link to perinatal mortality events in the first wave compared to the second wave, in which maternal morbidity was more associated with pneumonia. Likewise, maternal morbidity showed a strong correlation with perinatal morbidity events in both waves. We describe the differences between the patients' profiles and management between the two waves and related to maternal and perinatal outcomes. Differences were also observed in the management of pregnant women with COVID-19. Thus, there were fewer caesarean sections, and maternal and perinatal morbidity events were reduced in the second wave, while the impacts of respiratory symptoms and their severity, including a greater need for maternal treatment, were greater in this last period. Identifying the impact that changes in the profile as well as in the treatment have on maternal-perinatal morbidity and mortality will help improve the well-being of our patients and their newborns.

34287465	COVID-19 Pandemic impact on Brazil's Public Dental System. The present study aimed to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dental care procedures in the Public Health System in Brazil. A retrospective, ecological study was carried out, comprising 5,564 Brazilian municipalities. The number of dental procedures (per 100,000 inhabitants) performed in the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) was the outcome. The impact of the pandemic was estimated by comparing the rate of procedures for each month of 2020 with the rates observed in the equivalent months in 2019, considering the period from March to August. Regulatory legislation regarding restrictions on dental care, issued by the state governments of 27 Brazilian federative units, was used for mediation analysis. A 55% reduction was observed in March for all procedures (IRR = 0.45, 95%CI 0.39-0.51), while in the other months, the rate of reduction remained >/= 88%. The biggest decrease was observed in collective preventive procedures (reduction >/=99%) between April and August. Procedures that were less likely to generate aerosols (tooth extraction and prosthetic) and emergencies showed the smallest reduction. The reduction was not mediated by the restrictions imposed by state governments (p>0.05). The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was noteworthy in terms of the decrease in the number of dental procedures carried out in the Brazilian Public Dental Service. The lack of access, the delay of elective procedures and the lack of preventive collective procedures could result in an overburdened system, post-Pandemic.	Prevention
34293142	Epidemiological, Clinical and Biomarker Profile of Pediatric Patients Infected with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Given the limited and diverse nature of published literature related to COVID-19 in pediatrics, it is imperative to provide evidence-based summary of disease characteristics for guiding policy decisions. We aim to provide comprehensive overview of epidemiological, clinical and biomarker profile of COVID-19 infection in pediatric population. METHODS: For this umbrella review, published systematic reviews from PubMed and pre-print databases were screened. Literature search was conducted from December 2019 to April 2021. Details of clinical, radiological, laboratory features were collected from each review. Qualitative observations were synthesized and pooled prevalence of mortality and asymptomatic cases were assessed using meta-analysis. RESULTS: Evidence synthesis of 38 systematic reviews included total 1145 studies and 3,34,398 children and adolescents. Review revealed that COVID-19 is relatively milder with better prognosis in pediatrics. However, patients with comorbidity are at higher risk. Meta-analysis of reviews showed that 21.17% (95% CI: 17.818 to 24.729) of the patients were asymptomatic and mortality rate was 0.12% (95% CI:0.0356-0.246). Though there was no publication bias, significant heterogeneity was observed. Fever (48-64%) and cough (35-55.9%) were common symptoms, affecting almost every alternate patient. Ground glass opacities (prevalence range:27.4-61.5%) was most frequent radiographic observation. Rise in C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer ranged from 14-54%, 12.2-50% and 0.3-67% respectively. Some of the included reviews (44.7%-AMSTAR; 13.2%-GRADE) were of lower quality. CONCLUSION: Current umbrella review provides most updated information regarding characteristics of COVID-19 infection in pediatrics and can be used to guide policy decision regarding vaccination prioritization, early screening and identification of at-risk population.

34286362	SARS-CoV-2 and pathological matrix remodeling mediators. BACKGROUND: Recognizing only sharp elevation in a short period of time, the COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 propagation is more and more marked in the whole world. Induced inflammation afterwards infection engenders a high infiltration of immune cells and cytokines that triggers matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activation. These endopeptidases are mediators of the lung extracellular matrix (ECM), a basic element for alveoli structure and gas exchange. METHODS: When immune cells, MMPs, secreted cytokines and several other mediators are gathered a pathological matrix remodeling occurs. This phenomenon tends to tissue destruction in the first place and a pulmonary hypertrophy and fibrosis in the second place. FINDINGS: After pathological matrix remodeling establishment, pathological diseases take place even after infection state. Since post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is an emerging complication of the disease, there is an urge to better understand and characterize the implication of ECM remodeling during SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Targeting MMPs and their inhibitors could be a probable solution for occurred events since there are many cured patients that remain with severe sequels even after the end of infection.

34208007	Diagnostic, Clinical and Post-SARS-CoV-2 Scenarios in Cancer Patients with SARS-CoV-2: Retrospective Analysis in Three German Cancer Centers. Oncologists face challenges in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infections and post-SARS-CoV-2 cancer treatment. We analyzed diagnostic, clinical and post-SARS-CoV-2 scenarios in patients from three German cancer centers with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sixty-three patients with SARS-CoV-2 and hematologic or solid neoplasms were included. Thirty patients were initially asymptomatic, 10 of whom developed COVID-19 symptoms subsequently. Altogether 20 (32%) patients were asymptomatic, 18 (29%) had mild, 12 (19%) severe and 13 (20%) critical courses. Lymphocytopenia increased risk of severe/critical COVID-19 three-fold (p = 0.015). Asymptomatic course was not associated with age, remission status, therapies or co-morbidities. Secondary bacterial infection accompanied more than one third of critical COVID-19 cases. Treatment was delayed post-SARS-CoV-2 in 46 patients, 9 of whom developed progressive disease (PD). Cancer therapy was modified in 8 SARS-CoV-2 survivors because of deteriorating performance or PD. At the last follow-up, 17 patients had died from COVID-19 (n = 8) or PD (n = 9) giving an estimated 73% four-month overall survival rate. SARS-CoV-2 infection has a heterogenous course in cancer patients. Lymphocytopenia carries a significant risk of severe/critical COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 disruption of therapy is as serious as SARS-CoV-2 infection itself. Careful surveillance will allow early restart of the anti-cancer treatment.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34335338	The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias. Introduction: Numerous countries went into lockdown to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, which has impeded follow-up of chronic diseases, such as cognitive impairment (CI). Cognitive and neuropsychiatric changes during the COVID-19 pandemic are neglected in China, which is the world's whistleblower. To investigate the cognitive and neuropsychologic changes in CI, as well as the proportions of rapid cognitive decline (RCD) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide clinical evidence for CI intervention during a public health emergency. Methods: We performed a descriptive and retrospective study based on medical records from the memory clinic of Tianjin Dementia Institute collected through face-to-face evaluations. Information of 205 patients with CI, including patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia, of whom 131 with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were analyzed and compared to a control group before the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Among the 205 CI patients, the scores on the Chinese Mini Mental State Examination (C-MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), activities of daily living (ADLs), and the global Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were significantly different at the baseline and follow-up evaluations (p < 0.05) after 14.07 (+/-2.87) months. The same findings were recorded among AD patients, and they exhibited more sleep disturbances at the follow-up than at baseline (32.8 vs. 20.6%, p = 0.035). When compared to the control group, slightly worse performance of cognitive, -1.00 (-4.00, 1.00) from the C-MMSE, -1.00 (-2.00, 0.00) on the MoCA, 1.00 (0.00, 9.00) on ADLs and neuropsychological 0.00 (-1.00, 3.50) on the global NPI profile, at the follow-up were presented, particularly for delusion, agitation, irritability, and appetite disturbances (p < 0.05). Twenty-five (19.1%) AD patients and 48 (36.6%) controls suffered RCD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, AD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic were 0.408 times (95% confidence interval: 0.232-0.716) less likely to suffer RCD than the control. Conclusion: Confinement might ease the cognitive and neuropsychiatric deterioration of AD patients compared to those not in crisis and help prevent RCD in AD patients.	Prevention
34281182	Molecular Mechanisms of Palmitic Acid Augmentation in COVID-19 Pathologies. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed over 2.7 million lives globally. Obesity has been associated with increased severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms by which obesity exacerbates COVID-19 pathologies are not well-defined. The levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) are elevated in obese subjects. This study was therefore designed to examine how excess levels of different FFAs may affect the progression of COVID-19. Biological molecules associated with palmitic acid (PA) and COVID-19 were retrieved from QIAGEN Knowledge Base, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tools were used to analyze these datasets and explore the potential pathways affected by different FFAs. Our study found that one of the top 10 canonical pathways affected by PA was the coronavirus pathogenesis pathway, mediated by key inflammatory mediators, including PTGS2; cytokines, including IL1beta and IL6; chemokines, including CCL2 and CCL5; transcription factors, including NFkappaB; translation regulators, including EEF1A1; and apoptotic mediators, including BAX. In contrast, n-3 fatty acids may attenuate PA's activation of the coronavirus pathogenesis pathway by inhibiting the activity of such mediators as IL1beta, CCL2, PTGS2, and BAX. Furthermore, PA may modulate the expression of ACE2, the main cell surface receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.	Mechanism
34288969	Transmission dynamics and forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, March-December 2020. Mexico has experienced one of the highest COVID-19 mortality rates in the world. A delayed implementation of social distancing interventions in late March 2020 and a phased reopening of the country in June 2020 has facilitated sustained disease transmission in the region. In this study we systematically generate and compare 30-day ahead forecasts using previously validated growth models based on mortality trends from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation for Mexico and Mexico City in near real-time. Moreover, we estimate reproduction numbers for SARS-CoV-2 based on the methods that rely on genomic data as well as case incidence data. Subsequently, functional data analysis techniques are utilized to analyze the shapes of COVID-19 growth rate curves at the state level to characterize the spatiotemporal transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2. The early estimates of the reproduction number for Mexico were estimated between Rt ~1.1-1.3 from the genomic and case incidence data. Moreover, the mean estimate of Rt has fluctuated around ~1.0 from late July till end of September 2020. The spatial analysis characterizes the state-level dynamics of COVID-19 into four groups with distinct epidemic trajectories based on epidemic growth rates. Our results show that the sequential mortality forecasts from the GLM and Richards model predict a downward trend in the number of deaths for all thirteen forecast periods for Mexico and Mexico City. However, the sub-epidemic and IHME models perform better predicting a more realistic stable trajectory of COVID-19 mortality trends for the last three forecast periods (09/21-10/21, 09/28-10/27, 09/28-10/27) for Mexico and Mexico City. Our findings indicate that phenomenological models are useful tools for short-term epidemic forecasting albeit forecasts need to be interpreted with caution given the dynamic implementation and lifting of social distancing measures.

34227179	COVID-19 vaccination intention in the first year of the pandemic: A systematic review. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To synthesise evidence regarding vaccination intention, identify factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy among healthcare professionals and the general populations globally. BACKGROUND: As COVID-19 vaccine becomes available worldwide, attention is being directed to community vaccine uptake, to achieve population-wide immunity. A number of factors have been reported to influence vaccine intention. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search of COVID-19 vaccination intention related literature published on or before 31 December 2020 from seven databases was undertaken. RESULTS: Thirty articles were included in this systematic review. Overall COVID-19 vaccination intention during the first year of the pandemic ranged from 27.7% to 93.3%. Findings highlighted that socio-demographic differences, perceptions of risk and susceptibility to COVID-19 and vaccine attributes influenced vaccination intention. Healthcare professionals particularly, nurses have higher vaccine hesitancy reportedly due to concerns regarding vaccine safety and efficacy and mistrust of health authorities. Negative information about COVID-19 vaccines in the social media and low confidence in the health system were associated with lower acceptability among the community. Interestingly, cumulative increase in COVID-19 caseloads of countries over time was not associated with vaccination intention. CONCLUSIONS: The significant variability in vaccine intention rates worldwide would hamper efforts to achieve immunity against COVID-19. Nurses' concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy need to be addressed to increase vaccine acceptance and maximise their influence on vaccination decision in the community. As misinformation through social media negatively impacts vaccination uptake, authoritative and reliable information on vaccine attributes, disease risks and vaccination benefits are needed. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy including misinformation are important contributors to vaccine hesitancy. Addressing these factors, particularly among nurses who are considered trusted influencers of vaccination decisions in the community is an important strategy for pandemic preparedness.

34199272	The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on the New Cases of T1DM in Children. A Single-Centre Cohort Study. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) represents one of the most frequent chronic illnesses affecting children. The early diagnosis of this disease is crucial, as it plays a key role in preventing the development of a life-threatening acute complication: diabetic ketoacidosis. The etiopathogenetic role of viral infections has long been suggested and emerging data are pointing towards a complex bidirectional relationship between diabetes and COVID-19. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence and severity of new T1DM cases in children in Romania. We analyzed the differences between a group of 312 patients diagnosed with T1DM in the period 2003-2019 and a group of 147 children diagnosed during the pandemic. The data were investigated using statistical analysis of a series of relevant variables. The total number of newly diagnosed T1DM increased by 30.08% in the period March 2020-February 2021 compared to the previous years. The patients in the pandemic group had a higher mean age at the onset of T1DM, were less frequently living in an urban area, and presented a higher mean value of HbA1c. Diabetic ketoacidosis at the onset of T1DM was 67.40% more frequent, and a higher percentage of these patients presented with a severe form. The duration of T1DM symptoms did not differ significantly between the two groups. A number of 8 patients associated SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of T1DM diagnosis.	Diagnosis
34282409	COVIDTrach: a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheostomy in the UK. Objectives: COVIDTrach is a UK multicentre prospective cohort study project that aims to evaluate the outcomes of tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation and record the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers involved in the procedure. Design: Data on patient demographic, clinical history and outcomes were entered prospectively and updated over time via an online database (REDCap). Clinical variables were compared with outcomes, with logistic regression used to develop a model for mortality. Participants recorded whether any operators tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 2 weeks of the procedure. Setting: UK National Health Service departments involved in treating patients with COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation. Participants: The cohort comprised 1605 tracheostomy cases from 126 UK hospitals collected between 6 April and 26 August 2020. Main outcome measures: Mortality following tracheostomy, successful wean from mechanical ventilation and length of time from tracheostomy to wean, discharge from hospital, complications from tracheostomy, reported SARS-CoV-2 infection among operators. Results: The median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 15 days (IQR 11, 21). 285 (18%) patients died following the procedure. 1229 (93%) of the survivors had been successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation at censoring and 1049 (81%) had been discharged from hospital. Age, inspired oxygen concentration, positive end-expiratory pressure setting, fever, number of days of ventilation before tracheostomy, C reactive protein and the use of anticoagulation and inotropic support independently predicted mortality. Six reports were received of operators testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 2 weeks of the procedure. Conclusions: Tracheostomy appears to be safe in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and to operators performing the procedure and we identified clinical parameters that are predictive of mortality. Trial registration number: The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.Gov (NCT04572438).	Diagnosis;Treatment
34286282	Empirical Assessment of U.S. Coronavirus Disease 2019 Crisis Standards of Care Guidelines. To establish the feasibility of empirically testing crisis standards of care guidelines. DESIGN: Retrospective single-center study. SETTING: ICUs at a large academic medical center in the United States. SUBJECTS: Adult, critically ill patients admitted to ICU, with 27 patients admitted for acute respiratory failure due to coronavirus disease 2019 and 37 patients admitted for diagnoses other than coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Review of electronic health record. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Many U.S. states released crisis standards of care guidelines with algorithms to allocate scarce healthcare resources during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We compared state guidelines that represent different approaches to incorporating disease severity and comorbidities: New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Colorado. Following each algorithm, we calculated priority scores at the time of ICU admission for a cohort of patients with primary diagnoses of coronavirus disease 2019 and diseases other than coronavirus disease 2019 (n = 64). We assessed discrimination of 28-day mortality by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We simulated real-time decision-making by applying the triage algorithms to groups of two, five, or 10 patients. For prediction of 28-day mortality by priority scores, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.56, 0.49, 0.53, 0.66, and 0.69 for New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and raw Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score algorithms, respectively. For groups of five patients, the percentage of decisions made without deferring to a lottery were 1%, 57%, 80%, 88%, and 95% for New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and raw Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score algorithms, respectively. The percentage of decisions made without lottery was higher in the subcohort without coronavirus disease 2019, compared with the subcohort with coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of comorbidities does not consistently improve an algorithm's performance in predicting 28-day mortality. Crisis standards of care algorithms result in a substantial percentage of tied priority scores. Crisis standards of care algorithms operate differently in cohorts with and without coronavirus disease 2019. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the feasibility and importance of empirical testing of crisis standards of care guidelines to understand whether they meet their goals.

34220483	Prognostic Factors in COVID-19 Patients With New Neurological Manifestations: A Retrospective Cohort Study in a Romanian Neurology Department. Introduction: The emerging Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious public health issue due to its rapid spreading, high mortality rate and lack of specific treatment. Given its unpredictable clinical course, risk assessment, and stratification for severity of COVID-19 are required. Apart from serving as admission criteria, prognostic factors might guide future therapeutic strategies. Aim: We aimed to compare clinical features and biological parameters between elderly (age >/= 65 years) and non-elderly (age <65 years) patients with COVID-19 and new neurological symptoms/conditions. We also aimed to determine factors independently associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality. Methods: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 and new neurological symptoms/conditions admitted in our Neurology Department between April 1 and August 23, 2020 were enrolled in this observational retrospective cohort study. Patient characteristics such as demographic data, comorbidities, biological parameters, imaging findings and clinical course were recorded. All-cause in-hospital mortality was the main outcome, whereas COVID-19 severity, hospitalization duration and the levels of supplemental oxygen were the secondary outcomes. Results: One hundred forty-eight patients were included, out of which 54.1% were women. The average age was 59.84 +/- 19.06 years and 47.3% were elderly, the majority having cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. In the elderly group, the most frequent neurological symptoms/manifestations responsible for hospitalization were stroke symptoms followed by confusion, whereas in the non-elderly, headache prevailed. The final neurological diagnosis significantly varied between the two groups, with acute cerebrovascular events and acute confusional state in dementia most commonly encountered in the elderly (65.71 and 14.28%, respectively) and secondary headache attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection often experienced by the non-elderly (38.46%). The elderly had statistically significant higher median values of white blood cell (8,060 vs. 6,090/muL) and neutrophil count (6,060 vs. 4,125/muL), C-reactive protein (29.2 vs. 5.72 mg/L), ferritin (482 vs. 187 mg/dL), fibrinogen (477 vs. 374 mg/dL), D-dimer (1.16 vs. 0.42), prothrombin time (151.15 vs. 13.8/s), aspartate transaminase (26.8 vs. 20.8 U/l), creatinine (0.96 vs. 0.77 mg/dL), and blood urea nitrogen level (51.1 vs. 27.65 mg/dL), as well as lower median value of hemoglobin (13.05 vs. 13.9 g/dL) and lymphocyte count (1,245 vs. 1,670/muL). Moreover, advanced age was significantly associated with more extensive lung involvement (25 vs. 10%) and higher fatality rate (40 vs. 9%). Overall, the mortality rate was 23.6%. Age as well as neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time levels were independently associated with mortality. Conclusions: Older age, higher neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time levels are independent predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients with new neurological manifestations/conditions at admission.

34373155	SARS-CoV-2 and pancreas: a potential pathological interaction? The widespread extrapulmonary complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have gained momentum; the pancreas is another major target for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we take a closer look into potential pathological interactions. We provide an overview of the current knowledge and understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the pancreas with a special focus on pancreatic islets and propose direct, indirect, and systemic mechanisms for pancreas injury as result of the COVID-19-diabetes fatal bidirectional relationship.

34221791	Modeling population-wide testing of SARS-CoV-2 for containing COVID-19 pandemic in Okinawa, Japan. To break the chains of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, population-wide testing has been practiced in various countries. However, scant research has addressed this topic in Japan. In this modeling exercise, we extracted the number of daily reported cases of COVID-19 in Okinawa from October 1 to November 30, 2020, and explored possible scenarios for decreasing COVID-19 incidence by combining population-wide screening and/or social distancing policy. We reveal that permanent lockdown can be theoretically replaced by mass testing but sufficient target population at an adequate frequency must be mobilized. In addition, solely imposing a circuit breaker will not bring a favorable outcome in the long run, and mass testing presents implications for minimizing a period of lockdown. Our results highlight the importance of incentivizing citizens to join the frequent testing and ensure their appropriate isolation. This study also suggests that early containment of COVID-19 will be feasible in prefectures where the mobility is low and/or can be easily controlled for its geographic characteristics. Rigorous investment in public health will be manifestly vital to contain COVID-19.	Prevention
34201088	A Unique SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein P681H Variant Detected in Israel. The routine detection, surveillance, and reporting of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial, as these threaten to hinder global vaccination efforts. Herein we report a novel local variant with a non-synonymous mutation in the spike (S) protein P681H. This local Israeli variant was not associated with a higher infection rate or higher prevalence. Furthermore, the local variant was successfully neutralized by sera from fully vaccinated individuals at a comparable level to the B.1.1.7 variant and an Israel wild-type strain. While it is not a variant of concern, routine monitoring by sequencing is still required.	Mechanism;Diagnosis
34229209	SARS-CoV-2 antibody response dynamics and heterogeneous diagnostic performance of four serological tests and a neutralization test in symptomatic healthcare workers with non-severe COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Most COVID-19 patients experience non-severe illness. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies suggest possible protection against re-infections in prior SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this prospective observational study were to longitudinally assess the antibody response during the first 4-6 months after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to study the diagnostic performance of four different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) in symptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) with non-severe COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: HCWs in a teaching hospital were included between March 8 and June 15, 2020, when they had a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past 3 months. The performances of four ELISAs (Wantai, Bio-Rad Platelia, BioTrading Immy clarus, and Euroimmun) were evaluated in serum samples obtained at the moment of study inclusion and subsequently at 1, 2 and 3 months thereafter. Furthermore, in the last available serum sample sVNT by GenScript was performed. RESULTS: 309 samples from 80 positive HCWs were included of whom 70 (88%) were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by the different ELISAs were heterogenous ranging from 64% for the Euroimmun ELISA to 88% for the Wantai ELISA. The Wantai ELISA had the highest and almost perfect agreement with sVNT (96%, Cohen's kappa 0.83). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 (neutralizing) antibodies were detectable in most symptomatic individuals with non-severe COVID-19. The presence of antibodies remained stable up to six months after initial infection. There is large variability in diagnostic test performance between ELISA tests.	Diagnosis
34229222	A multicenter study investigating SARS-CoV-2 in tertiary-care hospital wastewater. viral burden correlates with increasing hospitalized cases as well as hospital-associated transmissions and outbreaks. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in wastewater and its abundance correlated with community COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. We sought to use wastewater-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 to assess the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals. Between August and December 2020, twice-weekly wastewater samples from three tertiary-care hospitals (totaling > 2100 dedicated inpatient beds) were collected. Hospital-1 and Hospital-2 could be captured with a single sampling point whereas Hospital-3 required three separate monitoring sites. Wastewater samples were concentrated and cleaned using the 4S-silica column method and assessed for SARS-CoV-2 gene-targets (N1, N2 and E) and controls using RT-qPCR. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 as measured by quantification cycle (Cq), genome copies and genomes normalized to the fecal biomarker PMMoV were compared to the total daily number of patients hospitalized with active COVID-19, confirmed cases of hospital-acquired infection, and the occurrence of unit-specific outbreaks. Of 165 wastewater samples collected, 159 (96%) were assayable. The N1-gene from SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 64.1% of samples, N2 in 49.7% and E in 10%. N1 and N2 in wastewater increased over time both in terms of the amount of detectable virus and the proportion of samples that were positive, consistent with increasing hospitalizations at those sites with single monitoring points (Pearson's r = 0.679, P < 0.0001, Pearson's r = 0.799, P < 0.0001, respectively). Despite increasing hospitalizations through the study period, nosocomial-acquired cases of COVID-19 (Pearson's r = 0.389, P < 0.001) and unit-specific outbreaks were discernable with significant increases in detectable SARS-CoV-2 N1-RNA (median 112 copies/ml) versus outbreak-free periods (0 copies/ml; P < 0.0001). Wastewater-based monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 represents a promising tool for SARS-CoV-2 passive surveillance and case identification, containment, and mitigation in acute- care medical facilities.

34216816	Promoting physical activity participation and nutrition education through a telehealth intervention for children on the autism spectrum and their caregivers. There is growing empirical support which suggests children on the autism spectrum, as well as their caregivers experience significant health disparities. The global COVID-19 pandemic has only magnified the need to address health among vulnerable populations. While there has been a growing trend in the delivery of telehealth interventions, the delivery of such methods for children on the autism spectrum, and their caregivers remains relatively under examined. The primary goal of PLANE (Physical Literacy And Nutrition Education) is to promote positive trajectories of health for children on the autism spectrum and their primary caregivers through the delivery of a telehealth physical activity and nutrition education program. The study is a pre-experimental analysis of PLANE across 12 months. All activities will be delivered virtually through weekly synchronous and asynchronous programming. A total of 180 participants will be enrolled in this intervention, including children on the autism spectrum and caregivers. Each week a new physical activity skill along with opportunities for recipe assembly will be delivered remotely. Supplemental material will be disseminated online including; step by step directions outlining behavioral skill methodology, opportunities for additional skill practice, and reading material that support weekly topics. Study outcomes will be examined in the parent-child dyad and include rates of overweight/obesity, physical activity, nutrition and quality of life. Finally, feasibility of the telehealth intervention will also be measured. Justification for the conceptualization and delivery of PLANE is well warranted, and PLANE represents a promising intervention which is scalable, sustainable, and replicable.	Prevention
34212940	[COVID-19 incidence in districts of Madrid and its relationship with socio-economic and demographic indicators.] OBJECTIVE: The preventive measures to be taken in the face of a new epidemic require knowledge of the number of infected and which groups are most vulnerable. To know the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the city of Madrid and its 21 districts in the first 4 months of the epidemic and its relationship with some socioeconomic and demographic variables. METHODS: Cross-sectional ecological study (39,270 cases). The 39,270 cases diagnosed from the beginning of the pandemic until June 26, 2020, published by the Comunidad de Madrid in were studied. In the districts, the distribution of gross and fair incidence is related to the ones of the independent variables (Municipal Statistics and Estudio de Salud 2018, Madrid Salud). The Incidence and the r and r(2) coefficients, obtained with the factors and the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model, are studied. RESULTS: The city of Madrid presents a cumulative incidence of COVID-19, which is double the national one (100), with a Standardized Cumulative Incidence Ratio (RIAE) of 204.59 per 100. The districts with the most RIAE were those in the southeast, all>240 per 100. In the districts, the per capita household rate, the per capita income, and the mortality rate from infectious diseases in men reached high and inverse correlations with RIAE (all r>-0.3). The RLM model with these 3 indicators predicts 30% of the RIAES. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between material wealth and the risk of COVID-19 infection is inverse. The knowledge in the districts of per capita income, household rate and mortality rate due to infectious diseases in men reduces the uncertainty about the accumulated incidence by 30%.	Prevention
34334850	Nanobiotechnology enabled approaches for wastewater based epidemiology. The impacts of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic highlight the importance of environmental monitoring to inform public health safety. Wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) has drawn interest as a tool for analysis of biomarkers in wastewater networks. Wide scale implementation of WBE requires a variety of field deployable analytical tools for real-time monitoring. Nanobiotechnology enabled sensing platforms offer potential as biosensors capable of highly efficient and sensitive detection of target analytes. This review provides an overview of the design and working principles of nanobiotechnology enabled biosensors and recent progress on the use of biosensors in detection of biomarkers. In addition, applications of biosensors for analysis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus are highlighted as they relate to the potential expanded use of biosensors for WBE-based monitoring. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in future applications of biosensors in WBE for effective monitoring and investigation of public health threats.	Diagnosis
34219801	"A call for caution regarding infection-acquired COVID-19 immunity: The potentially unintended effects of ""immunity passports"" and how to mitigate them. Research suggests that emerging information about infection-acquired COVID-19 immunity should be interpreted with caution. The introduction of ""immunity passports"" that would enable people who have recovered from COVID-19 to travel freely and return to work may therefore have detrimental consequences if not managed carefully. In two studies, we examined how perceived (suspected or imagined) recovery from COVID-19, and the concept of immunity passports, influence people's intentions to engage in behaviors aimed to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We also consider ways to lessen potential negative effects. In Study 1 (N = 1604), participants asked to imagine that they had recovered from COVID-19 reported lower social distancing intentions compared to a control condition. Participants who suspected (versus imagined) that they had recovered from past infection did not report lower preventative intentions compared to the control condition, even at high levels of certainty of past infection. In Study 2 (N = 1732), introducing the idea of immunity passports also reduced social distancing intentions compared to a control condition. The latter effect was, however, attenuated when cautious information about the equivocal science on COVID-19 was also presented to participants. Participants who suspected that they had COVID-19 in the past (compared to the control condition) revealed a similar pattern of results, but only at higher levels of certainty of past infection. Caution regarding infection-acquired COVID-19 immunity and immunity passports will be crucial in the COVID-19 response. Implications for premature pandemic announcements, as well as their potential remedies, are discussed."	Prevention
34289923	Counting Pandemic Statistics Remotely Using Webcams. OBJECTIVE: Lack of mask use during large public events might spread COVID-19. It is possible now to measure this and similar public health information using publicly available webcams. We demonstrate a rapid assessment approach for measuring mask usage at a public event. METHOD: We monitored crowds at public areas in Sturgis, SD using a live, high-definition, town-sponsored video stream to analyze the prevalence of mask wearing. We developed a rapid coding procedure for mask wearing and analyzed brief (5 to 25 min) video segments to assess mask-wearing compliance in outdoor public areas. We calculated compliance estimates and compared reliability among the human coders. RESULTS: We were able to observe and quantify public behavior on the public streets. This approach rapidly estimated public health information (e.g., 512 people observed over 25 minutes with 2.3% mask usage) available on the same day. Coders produced reliable estimates across a sample of videos for counting masked users and mask-wearing proportion. Our video data is stored in Databrary.org. CONCLUSIONS: This approach has implications for disaster responses and public health. The approach is easy to use, can provide same day results, and can provide public health stakeholders with key information on public behavior.	Prevention
34351971	Mechanisms of socioeconomic differences in COVID-19 screening and hospitalizations. BACKGROUND: Social and ecological differences in early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic screening and outcomes have been documented, but the means by which these differences have arisen are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To characterize socioeconomic and chronic disease-related mechanisms underlying these differences. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Outpatient and emergency care. PATIENTS: 12900 Cleveland Clinic Health System patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 testing between March 17 and April 15, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Nasopharyngeal PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. MEASUREMENTS: Test location (emergency department, ED, vs. outpatient care), COVID-19 symptoms, test positivity and hospitalization among positive cases. RESULTS: We identified six classes of symptoms, ranging in test positivity from 3.4% to 23%. Non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity was disproportionately represented in the group with highest positivity rates. Non-Hispanic Black patients ranged from 1.81 [95% confidence interval: 0.91-3.59] times (at age 20) to 2.37 [1.54-3.65] times (at age 80) more likely to test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus than non-Hispanic White patients, while test positivity was not significantly different across the neighborhood income spectrum. Testing in the emergency department (OR: 5.4 [3.9, 7.5]) and cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.5 [1.7, 3.8]) were related to increased risk of hospitalization among the 1247 patients who tested positive. LIMITATIONS: Constraints on availability of test kits forced providers to selectively test for SARS-Cov-2. CONCLUSION: Non-Hispanic Black patients and patients from low-income neighborhoods tended toward more severe and prolonged symptom profiles and increased comorbidity burden. These factors were associated with higher rates of testing in the ED. Non-Hispanic Black patients also had higher test positivity rates.	Diagnosis
34132790	Heparanase as a potential player in SARS-CoV-2 infection and induced coagulopathy. During the current formidable COVID-19 pandemic, it is appealing to address ideas that may invoke therapeutic interventions. Clotting disorders are well recognized in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which lead to severe complications that worsen the prognosis in these subjects. Increasing evidence implicate Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and Heparanase in various diseases and pathologies, including hypercoagulability states. Moreover, HSPGs and Heparanase are involved in several viral infections, in which they enhance cell entry and release of the viruses. Herein we discuss the molecular involvement of HSPGs and heparanase in SARS-CoV-2 infection, namely cell entry and release, and the accompanied coagulopathy complications, which assumedly could be blocked by heparanase inhibitors such as Heparin and Pixatimod.

34211545	Acute arterial ischemia in COVID-19. Since the coronavirus pandemic set in in Spain in March 2020, a noteworthy increase in the incidence of acute limb ischemia (ALI) has been observed. It has been recently discovered that SARS-CoV 2 may lead to ALI secondary to arterial thrombosis. Elevation of D-dimer (DD) in patients with coronavirus infection (COVID-19) indicates that a hypercoagulable state causes acute arterial thrombosis. A remarkably high DD elevation has been reported to be a poor prognosis factor in COVID-19. The ways in which SARS-CoV 2 results in arterial thrombosis may be multiple. On the other hand, surgical revascularization for ALI is associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients, probably in relation to hypercoagulability. Here, we describe two ALI cases in patients who required urgent surgical treatment for limb salvage and were positive for the novel coronavirus infection (COVID 19).	Case Report
34371003	Potential therapeutic approaches for the early entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interrupting the interaction between the spike protein on SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has quickly spread around the globe. At present, there is no precise and effective treatment for the patients with COVID-19, so rapid development of drugs is urgently needed in order to contain the highly infectious disease. The virus spike protein (S protein) can recognize the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell membrane and undergo a series of conformational changes, protease cleavage and membrane fusion to complete the virus entry, so S protein is an important target for vaccine and drug development. Here we provide a brief overview of molecular mechanisms of virus entry, as well as some potential antiviral agents that act on S/ACE2 protein-protein interaction. Specifically, we focused on experimentally validated and/or computational prediction identified inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2 S protein, ACE2 and enzymes associated with viral infection. This review offers valuable information for the discovery and development of potential antiviral agents in combating SARS-CoV-2. In addition, with the deepening understanding of the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection, more targeted prevention and treatment drugs will be explored with the aid of the advanced technology in the future.

34346643	[Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia; extremely rare adverse event with major potential consequences]. Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is diagnosed if there is venous or arterial thrombosis with thrombocytopenia caused by antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) that activate thrombocytes and is confirmed by a heparin-induced platelet activation (HIPA) test, occurring 4 to 28 days after vaccination against COVID19. This extremely rare syndrome has been recognized after Astra Zeneca (reporting incidence 0.91 per 100.000) and Janssen vaccins (0.22 per 100.000). Causality with the vaccine is difficult to ascertain if the HIPA test is negative, or if there is severe thrombosis (such as cerebral sinus or splanchnic thrombosis) without thrombocytopenia. Symptoms compatible with thrombosis or bleeding occurring in a specific time window after vaccination should prompt urgent assessment of the thrombocyte count and appropriate diagnostic tests. Heparin-like anticoagulants should be avoided and central laboratory assessment is essential. Early recognition likely improves prognosis of this extremely rare but severe complication of vaccination against COVID-19.	Treatment;Diagnosis
34226849	Obesity and its implications on cerebral circulation and intracranial compliance in severe COVID-19. Objective: Multiple factors have been identified as causes of intracranial compliance impairment (ICCI) among patients with obesity. On the other hand, obesity has been linked with worst outcomes in COVID-19. Thus, the hypothesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) conducing to cerebral hemodynamic disorders (CHD) able to worsen ICCI and play an additional role on prognosis determination for COVID-19 among obese patients becomes suitable. Methods: 50 cases of SARS by COVID-19 were evaluated, for the presence of ICCI and cerebrovascular circulatory disturbances in correspondence with whether unfavorable outcomes (death or impossibility for mechanical ventilation weaning [MVW]) within 7 days after evaluation. The objective was to observe whether obese patients (BMI >/= 30) disclosed worse outcomes and tests results compared with lean subjects with same clinical background. Results: 23 (46%) patients among 50 had obesity. ICCI was verified in 18 (78%) obese, whereas in 13 (48%) of 27 non-obese (p = 0,029). CHD were not significantly different between groups, despite being high prevalent in both. 69% unfavorable outcomes were observed among obese and 44% for lean subjects (p = 0,075). Conclusion: In the present study, intracranial compliance impairment was significantly more observed among obese subjects and may have contributed for SARS COVID-19 worsen prognosis.

34226777	Improving the performance of deep learning models using statistical features: The case study of COVID-19 forecasting. COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of people's lives and disrupted the economy. Forecasting the number of cases infected with this virus can help authorities make accurate decisions on the interventions that must be implemented to control the pandemic. Investigation of the studies on COVID-19 forecasting indicates that various techniques such as statistical, mathematical, and machine and deep learning have been utilized. Although deep learning models have shown promising results in this context, their performance can be improved using auxiliary features. Therefore, in this study, we propose two hybrid deep learning methods that utilize the statistical features as auxiliary inputs and associate them with their main input. Specifically, we design a hybrid method of the multihead attention mechanism and the statistical features (ATT_FE) and a combined method of convolutional neural network and the statistical features (CNN_FE) and apply them to COVID-19 data of 10 countries with the highest number of confirmed cases. The results of experiments indicate that the hybrid models outperform their conventional counterparts in terms of performance measures. The experiments also demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid ATT_FE method over the long short-term memory model.	Epidemic Forecasting
34202172	Uncovering Signals from the Coronavirus Genome. A signal analysis of the complete genome sequenced for coronavirus variants of concern-B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.135 (Beta) and P1 (Gamma)-and coronavirus variants of interest-B.1.429-B.1.427 (Epsilon) and B.1.525 (Eta)-is presented using open GISAID data. We deal with a certain new type of finite alternating sum series having independently distributed terms associated with binary (0,1) indicators for the nucleotide bases. Our method provides additional information to conventional similarity comparisons via alignment methods and Fourier Power Spectrum approaches. It leads to uncover distinctive patterns regarding the intrinsic data organization of complete genomics sequences according to its progression along the nucleotide bases position. The present new method could be useful for the bioinformatics surveillance and dynamics of coronavirus genome variants.	Mechanism
34205119	Social Distancing, Lockdown and the Wide Use of Mask; A Magic Solution or a Double-Edged Sword for Respiratory Viruses Epidemiology? The use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing, lockdowns and the massive use of masks, have not only largely prevented the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but also of other respiratory viruses such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This decrease has been so high that, in most countries, the influenza and RSV epidemic has not occurred. Far from being a beneficial fact, this can be problematic, since the absence of circulation of certain pathogens can lead to a decrease in herd immunity against them. This can promote the rise of more serious, longer-lasting epidemics that start sooner. To alleviate the collateral effects that may occur due to the decrease in circulation of viruses such as influenza, it is necessary to increase the production of influenza vaccines, carry out mass vaccination campaigns and focus on vaccinating the main drivers of this virus, children.

34222146	Emergent Pneumonia in Children. In recent decades there have been multiple pathogens, viruses and bacteria, which have emerged as causal agents of pneumonia affecting adults, albeit less frequently, to children. For the purposes of this article we have classified emerging pathogens as follows: True emerging, to pathogens identified for the very first time affecting human population (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, avian influenza, and hantavirus); Re-emerging, to known pathogens which circulation was controlled once, but they have reappeared (measles, tuberculosis, antimicrobial resistant bacteria such as CA-MRSA, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and new serotypes of post-vaccine pneumococcal); and finally, those that we have called old known with new presentations, including common pathogens that, in particular condition, have changed their form of presentation (rhinovirus, and non-SARS coronavirus). We will review for each of them their epidemiology, forms of presentation, therapy, and prognosis in children compared to the adult with the aim of being able to recognize them to establish appropriate therapy, prognostics, and effective control measures.

34217468	Noninvasive respiratory support and patient self-inflicted lung injury in COVID-19: a narrative review. COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with hypoxaemic respiratory failure, ranging from mild to severe. Because of the worldwide shortage of ICU beds, a relatively high number of patients with respiratory failure are receiving prolonged noninvasive respiratory support, even when their clinical status would have required invasive mechanical ventilation. There are few experimental and clinical data reporting that vigorous breathing effort during spontaneous ventilation can worsen lung injury and cause a phenomenon that has been termed patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI). The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of P-SILI pathophysiology and the role of noninvasive respiratory support in COVID-19 pneumonia. Respiratory mechanics, vascular compromise, viscoelastic properties, lung inhomogeneity, work of breathing, and oesophageal pressure swings are discussed. The concept of P-SILI has been widely investigated in recent years, but controversies persist regarding its mechanisms. To minimise the risk of P-SILI, intensivists should better understand its underlying pathophysiology to optimise the type of noninvasive respiratory support provided to patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and decide on the optimal timing of intubation for these patients.

34201947	SARS-CoV-2 and Cytomegalovirus Co-Infections-A Case Series of Critically Ill Patients. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has placed great strain on the most developed of health care systems, especially in the context of critical care. Although co-infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV) are frequent in the critically ill due to underlying immune suppression of multiple causes, the impact on COVID-19 patients remains unclear. Furthermore, severe COVID-19 has recently been associated with significant immune suppression, and this may in turn impact CMV reactivation, possibly contributing to clinical course. Nevertheless, multiple confounding factors in these patients will certainly challenge upcoming research. The authors present a case series of five patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the context of respiratory failure due to severe COVID-19. All patients evolved with CMV reactivation during ICU stay.	Case Report
34221397	Benefits of Tocilizumab in patients with a severe form of SARS-CoV-2 infection: Experience of the intensive care unit of the Mohammed VI university hospital, Oujda. Background: COVID-19 is a new disease that appeared in December 2019. Millions of people have been infected and died from this infection. Until today, the pathophysiology and treatment of this infection remain unknown, but a lot of studies are trying to solve the mystery. The trail of inflammation remains the most convincing, especially the Interleukin 6 (IL-6) which could play an important role in a reaction cascade leading to a cytokine storm. According to studies, although few in number, the Tociluzimab (TCZ), which is an anti-IL6, could prevent or even suppress this storm, leading to a less severe clinical state of the disease and a faster recovery. This could decrease the use of oxygen, avoid the risk of intubation and mortality. Patients and methods: This single-center retrospective observational case review brought together 557 COVID-19 seriously ill patients (pulmonary involvement> 25% + SatO2AA <90%) admitted to the intensive care unit of our university hospital from March 1(st), 2020 to February 28(th), 2021. They were divided into 2 groups a Tociluzimab group (TCZ group) and a Non Tociluzimab group (NON TCZ) to facilitate the comparison. The aim of the study was to compare the length of hospital stay, the use of mechanical ventilation and the mortality in the TCZ group versus the NON TCZ group. Results: The average age of our patients was 62,05 years (+/-13.51) and 62.61 years (+/-16.33) respectively in the TCZ versus NON TCZ group. 76 (76%) were men while 24 were women (24%) in the TCZ group; and there was 313 (68.49%) men and 144 (31.51%) women in the NON TCZ group. Their average BMI was 28 kg/m2 (+/-4.52) in the TCZ group versus 27.89 kg/m2 (+/-4.73) in the NON TCZ group. Among them, the TCZ group included 38 (38%) diabetic patients, 38 hypertensive (38%), 12 heart disease (12%) and 2 chronic renal failure (2%), while the NON TCZ group regrouped 35 (7.65%) diabetics, 33 (7.22%) hypertensive, 12 heart disease (2.67%), and 5 chronic renal failure (1.09%) patients. The mean time to consultation of patients was almost similar in the two groups: 8.86 (+/-7,28) days for TCZ and 8.83 (+/-7,03) days for NON TCZ group. The mean length of ICU hospital stay was 9 days (4,94) for the TCZ group and 8,75 days (4,73) for the other one. The saturation at admission was at 74.92% (10.45) for the TCZ group ranging from 40% to 92%, and at 73,56% for the NON TCZ group. Lung damage from COVID-19 was extensive in 12%, severe in 32%, and critical in 56% of TCZ group enrolled cases. Meanwhile it was extensive in 23.63%, severe in 41,35%, and critical in 35,01% of the NON TCZ group. The biological findings found average of white blood cells at 12256/12082 e/mm(3), lymphocytes at 761/842 e/mm(3), CRP at 181/199 mg/L, ferritin at 1747/528 mug/L, and fibrinogen at 6.92/6.27 g/L for the TCZ group versus NON TCZ group. Medical care was based on isolation, oxygenotherapy, azithromycin, vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D, salicylic acid, dexamethasone followed with methylprednisolone, and anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients. The TCZ group received at least 1 course of Tociluzimab dosed at 400 mg (2 patients received 2 doses and 1 patient received 3 doses). The indication of a Tociluzimab course in our department was based on a set of arguments: an increase in oxygen requirements, a progression of lesions on chest-computed tomography and an increase in inflammation markers including IL-6, CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, and a decrease in the percentage of lymphocytes. The invasive mechanical ventilation was indicated for 4 (4%) patients in the TCZ group versus 192 (42,01%) in the NON TCZ. Among the 100 patients included in our cohort in the TCZ group, 40% died in intensive care unit and 60% had a favorable evolution with a decrease of the biological markers of inflammation. However, in the NON TCZ group, 197 (43,10%) passed away. Conclusion: The use of Tociluzimab in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia did not contribute to a significant difference in the reduction of hospital stay. However, the invasive mechanical ventilation was less needed in patients receiving Tociluzimab than the others. Moreover, there was a mortality benefit associated with the use of Tociluzimab, but only before 10 days of hospitalization.	Treatment
34216123	Association of Early Favipiravir Use with Reduced COVID-19 Fatality among Hospitalized Patients. BACKGROUND: The antiviral agent favipiravir is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined patients with a clinical, laboratory, and radiological diagnosis of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. We investigated the effect of administering enteral favipiravir at a 2 x 1,600 mg loading dose and 2 x 600 mg maintenance dose for 5 days in addition to the standard COVID-19 treatment. RESULTS: In total, 180 patients, who were hospitalized at the Istanbul Tuzla State Hospital and received favipiravir treatment between March 20, 2020 and May 30, 2020, were examined. Of these, 47 patients died. Thirty-three of the patients who died were aged over 65 years (70%), indicating that fatality was higher in elderly patients. Most of those who died had at least one comorbidity. Of the 101 patients who initiated favipiravir within </=3 days of hospitalization, 17 died (17%). Of the 79 patients who initiated favipiravir after >3 days of hospitalization, 30 died (38%) (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: We found that initiation of favipiravir within the first 72 h after the onset of disease symptoms reduced fatality in patients with COVID-19.	Treatment
34200681	"Population Mobility Trends, Deprivation Index and the Spatio-Temporal Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Ireland. Like most countries worldwide, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has adversely affected Ireland. The aim of this study was to (i) investigate the spatio-temporal trend of COVID-19 incidence; (ii) describe mobility trends as measured by aggregated mobile phone records; and (iii) investigate the association between deprivation index, population density and COVID-19 cases while accounting for spatial and temporal correlation. Standardised incidence ratios of cases were calculated and mapped at a high spatial resolution (electoral division level) over time. Trends in the percentage change in mobility compared to a pre-COVID-19 period were plotted to investigate the impact of lockdown restrictions. We implemented a hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal model (Besag, York and Mollie (BYM)), commonly used for disease mapping, to investigate the association between covariates and the number of cases. There have been three distinct ""waves"" of COVID-19 cases in Ireland to date. Lockdown restrictions led to a substantial reduction in human movement, particularly during the 1st and 3rd wave. Despite adjustment for population density (incidence ratio (IR) = 1.985 (1.915-2.058)) and the average number of persons per room (IR = 10.411 (5.264-22.533)), we found an association between deprivation index and COVID-19 incidence (IR = 1.210 (CI: 1.077-1.357) for the most deprived quintile compared to the least deprived). There is a large range of spatial heterogeneity in COVID-19 cases in Ireland. The methods presented can be used to explore locally intensive surveillance with the possibility of localised lockdown measures to curb the transmission of infection, while keeping other, low-incidence areas open. Our results suggest that prioritising densely populated deprived areas (that are at increased risk of comorbidities) during vaccination rollout may capture people that are at risk of infection and, potentially, also those at increased risk of hospitalisation."

34348067	Anti-inflammatory effects of GLP-1 in patients with COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: Understanding the pathogenesis and risk factors to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is necessary. Due to the importance of the inflammatory pathways in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients, evaluating the effects of anti-inflammatory medications is important. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) is awell-known glucose-lowering agent with anti-inflammatory effects. AREAS COVERED: Resources were extracted from the PubMed database, using keywords such as glucagon-like peptide-1, GLP-1 RA, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, inflammation, in April2021. In this review, the effects of GLP-1RA in reducing inflammation and modifying risk factors of COVID-19 severe complications are discussed. However, GLP-1 is degraded by DPP-4 with aplasma half-life of about 2-5 minutes, which makes it difficult to measure GLP-1 plasma level in clinical settings. EXPERT OPINION: Since no definitive treatment is available for COVID-19 so far, determining promising targets to design and/or repurpose effective medications is necessary.	Mechanism;Treatment
34215550	Surgery under COVID: An observational study. AIM: To evaluate the surgery program strategy adopted in an adult otorhinolaryngology and head and neck surgery department in an area badly affected by the Covid-19 epidemic peak. The main objective was to analyze the reasons for not cancelling surgeries and the postoperative course of operated patients. The secondary objective was to assess the situation of postponed patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-center observational study carried out during the COVID-19 period in France included 124 patients scheduled for surgery during the period March 21-May 20, 2020. The number and nature of operations, both performed and postponed, were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 54.0% patients were operated on during the COVID period and 46.0% were postponed. Operations were maintained in urgent or semi-urgent cases. The operated patients did not show any signs of infection during their hospital stay. A total of 29.8% of postponed patients were lost to follow-up and 49.1% were rescheduled. CONCLUSION: The application of national and international recommendations minimized the risk of loss of chance for operated patients without increasing the risk of contamination. The postponement of canceled operations resulted in considerable loss to follow-up. Intensified follow-up is necessary for these patients.	Prevention
34204846	Enhance Portable Radiograph for Fast and High Accurate COVID-19 Monitoring. This work aimed to assist physicians by improving their speed and diagnostic accuracy when interpreting portable CXRs as well as monitoring the treatment process to see whether a patient is improving or deteriorating with treatment. These objectives are in especially high demand in the setting of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With the recent progress in the development of artificial intelligence (AI), we introduce new deep learning frameworks to align and enhance the quality of portable CXRs to be more consistent, and to more closely match higher quality conventional CXRs. These enhanced portable CXRs can then help the doctors provide faster and more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. The contributions of this work are four-fold. Firstly, a new database collection of subject-pair radiographs is introduced. For each subject, we collected a pair of samples from both portable and conventional machines. Secondly, a new deep learning approach is presented to align the subject-pairs dataset to obtain a pixel-pairs dataset. Thirdly, a new PairFlow approach is presented, an end-to-end invertible transfer deep learning method, to enhance the degraded quality of portable CXRs. Finally, the performance of the proposed system is evaluated by UAMS doctors in terms of both image quality and topological properties. This work was undertaken in collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) to enhance portable/mobile COVID-19 CXRs, to improve the speed and accuracy of portable CXR images and aid in urgent COVID-19 diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.

34214539	Small molecule therapeutics to destabilize the ACE2-RBD complex: A molecular dynamics study. The ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected millions of people, claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, and made a worldwide health emergency. Understanding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mechanism of infection is crucial in the development of potential therapeutics and vaccines. The infection process is triggered by direct binding of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host-cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Many efforts have been made to design or repurpose therapeutics to deactivate the RBD or ACE2 and prevent the initial binding. In addition to direct inhibition strategies, small chemical compounds might be able to interfere and destabilize the metastable, prefusion complex of ACE2-RBD. This approach can be employed to prevent the further progress of virus infection at its early stages. In this study, molecular docking was employed to analyze the binding of two chemical compounds, SSAA09E2 and Nilotinib, with the druggable pocket of the ACE2-RBD complex. The structural changes as a result of the interference with the ACE2-RBD complex were analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that both Nilotinib and SSAA09E2 can induce significant conformational changes in the ACE2-RBD complex, intervene with the hydrogen bonds, and influence the flexibility of proteins. Moreover, essential dynamics analysis suggests that the presence of small molecules can trigger large-scale conformational changes that may destabilize the ACE2-RBD complex.	Mechanism;Treatment
34205561	Are Mobility and COVID-19 Related? A Dynamic Analysis for Portuguese Districts. In this research work, we propose to assess the dynamic correlation between different mobility indices, measured on a daily basis, and the new cases of COVID-19 in the different Portuguese districts. The analysis is based on global correlation measures, which capture linear and non-linear relationships in time series, in a robust and dynamic way, in a period without significant changes of non-pharmacological measures. The results show that mobility in retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, and public transport shows a higher correlation with new COVID-19 cases than mobility in parks, workplaces or residences. It should also be noted that this relationship is lower in districts with lower population density, which leads to the need for differentiated confinement policies in order to minimize the impacts of a terrible economic and social crisis.

34344162	Airway management in the adult patient with COVID-19: High flow nasal oxygen or not? A summary of evidence and local expert opinion. The use of high flow nasal oxygen in the care of COVID-19-positive adult patients remains an area of contention. Early guidelines have discouraged the use of high flow nasal oxygen therapy in this setting due to the risk of viral spread to healthcare workers. However, there is the need to balance the relative risks of increased aerosol generation and virus transmission to healthcare workers against the role high flow nasal oxygen has in reducing hypoxaemia when managing the airway in high-risk patients during intubation or sedation procedures. The authors of this article undertook a narrative review to present results from several recent papers. Surrogate outcome studies suggest that the risk of high flow nasal oxygen in dispersing aerosol-sized particles is probably not as great as first perceived. Smoke laser-visualisation experiments and particle counter studies suggest that the generation and dispersion of bio-aerosols via high flow nasal oxygen with flow rates up to 60 l/min is similar to standard oxygen therapies. The risk appears to be similar to oxygen supplementation via a Hudson mask at 15 l/min and significantly less than low flow nasal prong oxygen 1-5 l/min, nasal continuous positive airway pressure with ill-fitting masks, bilevel positive airway pressure, or from a coughing patient. However, given the limited safety data, we recommend a cautious approach. For intubation in the COVID-positive or suspected COVID-positive patient we support the use of high flow nasal oxygen to extend time to desaturation in the at-risk groups, which include the morbidly obese, those with predicted difficult airways and patients with significant hypoxaemia, ensuring well-fitted high flow nasal oxygen prongs with staff wearing full personal protective equipment. For sedation cases, we support the use of high flow nasal oxygen when there is an elevated risk of hypoxaemia (e.g. bariatric endoscopy or prone-positioned procedures), but recommend securing the airway with a cuffed endotracheal tube for the longer duration procedures when theatre staff remain in close proximity to the upper airway, or considering the use of a surgical mask to reduce the risk of exhaled particle dispersion.

34290883	The COVID-19 pandemic: a threat to antimicrobial resistance containment. As of 23 April 2021, the outbreak of COVID-19 claimed around 150 million confirmed cases with over 3 million deaths worldwide. Yet, an even more serious but silent pandemic, that of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), is likely complicating the outcome of COVID-19 patients. This study discusses the current knowledge on the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 and highlights the likely contribution of the COVID-19 pandemic on the escalation of AMR. COVID-19 engenders extensive antibiotic overuse and misuse, and will undoubtedly and substantially increase AMR rates worldwide. Amid the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers should consider the hidden threat of AMR much more, which may well be enhanced through improper use of antibiotics to treat patients with severe COVID-19 infection.

34209673	C9orf72 Intermediate Repeats Confer Genetic Risk for Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia Independently of Age. A cytokine storm, autoimmune features and dysfunctions of myeloid cells significantly contribute to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Genetic background of the host seems to be partly responsible for severe phenotype and genes related to innate immune response seem critical host determinants. The C9orf72 gene has a role in vesicular trafficking, autophagy regulation and lysosome functions, is highly expressed in myeloid cells and is involved in immune functions, regulating the lysosomal degradation of mediators of innate immunity. A large non-coding hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in this gene is the main genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), both characterized by neuroinflammation and high systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines, while HREs of intermediate length, although rare, are more frequent in autoimmune disorders. C9orf72 full mutation results in haploinsufficiency and intermediate HREs seem to modulate gene expression as well and impair autophagy. Herein, we sought to explore whether intermediate HREs in C9orf72 may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Although we found intermediate HREs in only a small portion of 240 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the magnitude of risk for requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation conferred by harboring intermediate repeats >10 units in at least one C9orf72 allele was more than twice respect to having shorter expansions, when adjusted for age (odds ratio (OR) 2.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-5.37, p = 0.040). The association between intermediate repeats >10 units and more severe clinical outcome (p = 0.025) was also validated in an independent cohort of 201 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. These data suggest that C9orf72 HREs >10 units may influence the pathogenic process driving more severe COVID-19 phenotypes.	Mechanism;Treatment
34372498	Potential Prophylactic Treatments for COVID-19. The World Health Organization declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern at the end of January 2020 and a pandemic two months later. The virus primarily spreads between humans via respiratory droplets, and is the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which can vary in severity, from asymptomatic or mild disease (the vast majority of the cases) to respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and death. Recently, several vaccines were approved for emergency use against SARS-CoV-2. However, their worldwide availability is acutely limited, and therefore, SARS-CoV-2 is still expected to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the upcoming year. Hence, additional countermeasures are needed, particularly pharmaceutical drugs that are widely accessible, safe, scalable, and affordable. In this comprehensive review, we target the prophylactic arena, focusing on small-molecule candidates. In order to consolidate a potential list of such medications, which were categorized as either antivirals, repurposed drugs, or miscellaneous, a thorough screening for relevant clinical trials was conducted. A brief molecular and/or clinical background is provided for each potential drug, rationalizing its prophylactic use as an antiviral or inflammatory modulator. Drug safety profiles are discussed, and current medical indications and research status regarding their relevance to COVID-19 are shortly reviewed. In the near future, a significant body of information regarding the effectiveness of drugs being clinically studied for COVID-19 is expected to accumulate, in addition to information regarding the efficacy of prophylactic treatments.

34226774	Analysis of COVID-19 and comorbidity co-infection model with optimal control. In this work, we develop and analyze a mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 with re-infection in order to assess the impact of prior comorbidity (specifically, diabetes mellitus) on COVID-19 complications. The model is simulated using data relevant to the dynamics of the diseases in Lagos, Nigeria, making predictions for the attainment of peak periods in the presence or absence of comorbidity. The model is shown to undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation caused by the parameter accounting for increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles as well as the rate of reinfection by those who have recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection. Simulations of the cumulative number of active cases (including those with comorbidity), at different reinfection rates, show infection peaks reducing with decreasing reinfection of those who have recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection. In addition, optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis of the model reveal that the strategy that prevents COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles is the most cost-effective of all the control strategies for the prevention of COVID-19.

34210269	Quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals in response to COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China. OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of Fangcang shelter hospitals, designated hospitals, and the time interval from illness onset to diagnosis toward the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.	Prevention
34348696	Connected diagnostics to improve accurate diagnosis, treatment, and conditional payment of malaria services in Kenya. BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, the material and human capacity to diagnose patients reporting with fever to healthcare providers is largely insufficient. Febrile patients are typically treated presumptively with antimalarials and/or antibiotics. Such over-prescription can lead to drug resistance and involves unnecessary costs to the health system. International funding for malaria is currently not sufficient to control malaria. Transition to domestic funding is challenged by UHC efforts and recent COVID-19 outbreak. Herewith we present a digital approach to improve efficiencies in diagnosis and treatment of malaria in endemic Kisumu, Kenya: Connected Diagnostics. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, user experience and clinical performance of this approach in Kisumu. METHODS: Our intervention was performed Oct 2017-Dec 2018 across five private providers in Kisumu. Patients were enrolled on M-TIBA platform, diagnostic test results digitized, and only positive patients were digitally entitled to malaria treatment. Data on socio-demographics, healthcare transactions and medical outcomes were analysed using standard descriptive quantitative statistics. Provider perspectives were gathered by 19 semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: In total 11,689 febrile patients were digitally tested through five private providers. Malaria positivity ranged from 7.4 to 30.2% between providers, significantly more amongst the poor (p < 0.05). Prescription of antimalarials was substantially aberrant from National Guidelines, with 28% over-prescription (4.6-63.3% per provider) and prescription of branded versus generic antimalarials differing amongst facilities and correlating with the socioeconomic status of clients. Challenges were encountered transitioning from microscopy to RDT. CONCLUSION: We provide full proof-of-concept of innovative Connected Diagnostics to use digitized malaria diagnostics to earmark digital entitlements for correct malaria treatment of patients. This approach has large cost-saving and quality improvement potential.	Prevention
34226904	Mild anemia as a single independent predictor of mortality in patients with COVID-19. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an unprecedented international health crisis. COVID-19 clinical presentations cover a wide range from asymptomatic to severe illness and death. Given the limited therapeutic resources and unexpected clinical features of the disease, readily accessible predictive biomarkers are urgently needed to improve patient care and management. We asked the degree to which anemia may influence the outcome of patients with COVID-19. To this end, we identified 3777 patients who were positively diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 1 2020 in New York City. We evaluated 2,562 patients with available red blood cell, hemoglobin, and related laboratory values. Multivariable cox proportional hazards regression showed that anemia was a significant independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio (HR): 1.26, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.06-1.51), independent of age, sex, and comorbidities. There was a direct correlation between the degree of anemia and the risk of mortality when hemoglobin was treated as a continuous variable (HRadj 1.05; [CI]: 1.01-1.09). The hemoglobin level that was maximally predictive of mortality, was 11.5 g/dL in males and 11.8 g/dL in females. These findings identify a routinely measured biomarker that is predictive of disease outcomes and will aid in refining clinical care algorithms and optimize resource allocation. Mechanisms of impacts of anemia on COVID-19 outcome are likely to be multiple in nature and require further investigation.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34344017	COVID-19 and the Kidney: Should Nephrologists Care about COVID-19 rather than Maintaining Their Focus on Renal Patients? Clinical Background: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread globally from late 2019, reaching pandemic proportions. Epidemiology: The related disease, COVID-19, exacerbates and progresses due to patients' abnormal inflammatory/immune responses, widespread endothelial damage, and complement-induced blood clotting with microangiopathy. COVID-19 manifests mainly as a respiratory illness. In cases of severe viral pneumonia, it may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and death. Challenges: Many extrapulmonary manifestations commonly occur, and a substantial proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit signs of kidney damage. Clinically, kidney involvement ranges from mild/moderate proteinuria and hematuria to acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). The pathophysiologic mechanisms of kidney damage and AKI in patients with COVID-19 remain unclear but are known to be multifactorial. Current knowledge implies direct SARS-CoV-2-dependent effects on kidney cells (tubular epithelial cells and podocytes) and indirect mechanisms through the systemic effect of viral infection secondary to the critical pulmonary illness and its management. Prevention and Treatment: Standard-of-care strategies apply, as there is no specific evidence to suggest that COVID-19 AKI should be managed differently from other types in severely ill patients. If conservative management fails, RRT should be considered. The choice of RRT approaches and sequential extracorporeal therapies depends on local availability, resources, and expertise. The focus should now be on the long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients, especially those who developed kidney injury and dysfunction. This represents an opportunity for integrated multidisciplinary research to clarify the natural history of COVID-19 renal sequelae and the best therapeutic interventions to mitigate them.

34333882	"COVID-19 and lung pathologies. COVID-19 is a global emergency with over 10 million cases and over 500, 000 deaths worldwide. The SARS CoV-2 is a RNA virus belonging to the family coronaviridae. It has high infectivity. The manifestations of the disease range from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe pneumonia and ARDS. The CT scan of lung shows consolidation and ""Ground Glass Opacities"". The persons with other comorbidities are considered to be at a higher rate of acquiring the infection. Asthma and other allergies have not been identified as major risk factors for COVID-19 as the number of asthmatic patients having COVID-19 is not high enough for it to be considered so. The occurrence of COVID-19 in COPD patients can be related with smoking. The ACE-2 expression in such patients was considerably high. The relation between COVID-19 and Tuberculosis can also be reflected in terms of the stigma associated with diagnosis and treatment of such diseases in some communities, eventually increasing the chances of people's reluctance to seek medical help. Cancer patients are usually more susceptible to infections. Lung cancer is no different. Additionally, lung cancer also has strong association with smoking further increasing the risk. The risk of getting infection and its severity is high for autoimmune disorders as well as fungal infections. Currently there is no definite treatment of COVID-19. However, some of the currently used modalities are hydroxychloroquine and antiviral drugs."	Diagnosis;Treatment
34216962	"Toxicological insights of Spike fragments SARS-CoV-2 by exposure environment: A threat to aquatic health? The Spike protein (S protein) is a critical component in the infection of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The objective of this work was to evaluate whether peptides from S protein could cause negative impact in the aquatic animals. The aquatic toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein peptides derivatives has been evaluated in tadpoles (n = 50 tadpoles/5 replicates of 10 animals) from species Physalaemus cuvieri (Leptodactylidae). After synthesis, purification, and characterization of peptides (PSDP2001, PSDP2002, PSDP2003) an aquatic contamination has been simulated with these peptides during 24 h of exposure in two concentrations (100 and 500 ng/mL). The control group (""C"") was composed of tadpoles kept in polyethylene containers containing de-chlorinated water. Oxidative stress, antioxidant biomarkers and AChE activity were assessed. In both concentrations, PSPD2002 and PSPD2003 increased catalase and superoxide dismutase antioxidants enzymes activities, as well as oxidative stress (nitrite levels, hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species). All three peptides also increased acetylcholinesterase activity in the highest concentration. These peptides showed molecular interactions in silico with acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzymes. Aquatic particle contamination of SARS-CoV-2 has cholinesterasic effect in P. cuvieri tadpoles. These findings indicate that the COVID-19 can constitute environmental impact or biological damage potential."	Mechanism
34226070	Early Outcomes of Bivalirudin Therapy for Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia and Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis After Ad26.COV2.S Vaccination. Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia is a newly described disease process in the setting of expanding access to COVID-19 vaccination. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends treatment with an alternative to heparin in patients suspected of having vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia. At this time there have been no reported outcomes from the treatment of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia with bivalirudin as a heparin alternative. We describe the early outcomes from the treatment of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia with bivalirudin as a heparin alternative. A 40-year-old Caucasian woman was found to have thrombocytopenia, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism following vaccination for COVID-19 with Ad26.COV2.S. She exhibited a steady rise in platelet count: 20x10(9)/L at hospital day 0, 115x10(9)/L at discharge on hospital day 6, and 182x10(9)/L on outpatient follow-up on day 9. While the patient exhibited a transient drop in hemoglobin, there was no clinical evidence of bleeding. This patient did not demonstrate any clinical sequelae of thrombosis, and she reported resolution of her headache. Vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S appears to be associated with a small but significant risk for thrombotic thrombocytopenia within 13 days of receipt. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance to consider an alternative to heparin was not accompanied by specifically recommended alternatives. A single patient treated with bivalirudin for suspected vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia subsequently experienced symptom improvement and a rise in platelet count and did not demonstrate any immediate negative outcomes. A provider may consider bivalirudin as an alternative to heparin in patients with suspected vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination, pending more definitive research.

34227123	Patient safety time for federally mandated registered nurse to patient ratios. COVID-19 highlighted the role registered nurses (RNs) have in our healthcare system. The shortage of equipment plus an overwhelming demand for nursing care placed significant stress on nurses. The physical and emotional toll of caring for COVID patients and not having an adequate number of nurses in many cases placed many nurses in harm's way. Despite some healthcare systems reporting significant profits during COVID, few nurses benefited financially. ICU nurses found themselves assigned to three or more patients. Having a defined RN to patient ratio is an urgent need. Pass efforts to mandate via Federal legislation ratios have failed largely due to hospitals' opposition. California has had mandated RN to patient ratios since 2011. Their experience has proven that patient outcomes improve as well as nurse retention. Hospitals' decrease has largely offset the impacts of hospitals' net revenue by decreasing acquired infections, reducing the 30-readmission rate, and improving patient satisfaction scores. As documented in recent Harris polls, the consumer appears ready to support nurses, with nurses enjoying significant public support. The political climate for such change is favorable compared to the past. The Yoder-Wise Planned Policy Change illustrates how Federal legislation mandates RN to patient ratios is achievable.

34286803	Immunonutrition effects on coping with COVID-19. COVID-19 implications are still a threat to global health. In the face of this pandemic, food and nutrition are key issues that can boost the immune system. The bioactivity of functional foods and nutrients (probiotics, prebiotics, water- and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, glutamine, arginine, nucleotides, and PUFAs) contributes to immune system modulation, which establishes the status of nutrients as a factor of immune competence. These foods can contribute, especially during a pandemic, to the minimization of complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it is important to support the nutritional strategies for strengthening the immune status, associated with good eating habits, as a way to confront COVID-19.	Prevention
34368407	Potential drug leads for SARS-CoV2 from phytochemicals of Aerva lanata: a Machine Learning approach. COVID-19 outbreak is the recently reported worldwide pandemic threat. As part of our interventions with machine learning and molecular simulation approaches, we report the inhibitory effect of thirty compounds reported from the sacred plant Aerva lanata. The predicted activity of the screened ligands are comparable with the one of the present medication, hydroxy chloroquine (HCQ), on the main protease (PDB:6YB7) of SARS-CoV-2. Our studies pointed out the effectiveness of the plant with twenty seven compounds having potential activity against the main protease compared to the reference HCQ. The robustness of some of the phytochemicals such as ervoside, which is only present in Aerva lanata computed to have very high anticoronavirus activity. The results are indicative of potential natural antivirus source, which subsidizes in thwarting the invasion of coronavirus into the human body. Many phytochemicals which are computed to be effective towards SARS-CoV-2 in this study are used as drugs for various other diseases. Perhaps these compounds could be attractive for the management of COVID-19, but clinical trials must be performed in order to validate this observation.	Mechanism;Treatment
34222706	Knowledge of health care workers regarding COVID-19 pandemic response plan; A study from a university affiliated hospital in Jordan. Background: The education and training of healthcare workers (HCWs) about pandemic response plans, infection control protocols (ICP), and precautions are critical for breaking the virus transmission chain. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of HCWs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic response plan and the ICP. Concomitantly, evaluating the effectiveness and impact of institutional measures, policies, and training programs. Methods: A cross-sectional study using an electronic questionnaire was used to collect data from 267 HCWs at a University-affiliated-hospital during April 2020. Results: In this study, 90.7% of participants were nurses and 66% were females. 60.3% of participants received specific training about caring for COVID-19 patients while at least 94.3% reviewed the pandemic response plan and ICP for COVID-19. 47.5% and 29.2% of participants provided direct care for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, respectively. Between 85.7% and 100% of the participants answered all items correctly regarding the COVID-19 pandemic response plan, measures, and precautions. Furthermore, the correct answers were above 95% for each item. Conclusion: HCWs have a high level of knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic response plan and ICP. Training and disseminating updated plans and protocols in different methods such as an intranet and onsite training in addition to regular methods were very effective.	Prevention
34372862	Dynamically adjusted strategy in response to developments in the COVID-19 pandemic as a new normal. Presently, the developments of COVID-19 situation in different countries and regions have clearly differentiated. Due to differences in resources, infrastructure, and awareness of epidemic prevention and control, capabilities for COVID-19 prevention and control in various regions have also shown a significant imbalance as the COVID-19 epidemic is entering a new normal. The objectives of this study are to provide dynamically adjusted strategies in response to developments in the COVID-19 pandemic as a new normal. In the face of the new normal, one key is normalizing epidemic prevention and control. As part of this, we should implement precise policies based on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic and particular response needs. In ongoing COVID-19 prevention and control, we must pay attention to new vulnerabilities and new features in the dynamics of the epidemic. In this study, health and government officials can benefit from insights of preparing ourselves for long-term challenges and both certainties and uncertainties in a future facing COVID-19.	Prevention
34215561	Outcomes and risk factors for death in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia admitted to the intensive care units of an Egyptian University Hospital. A retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: The characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors for in-hospital death of critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have been described in patients from Europe, North America and China, but there are few data from COVID-19 patients in Middle Eastern countries. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors for in-hospital death of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICUs of a University Hospital in Egypt. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted between April 28 and July 29, 2020 to two ICUs dedicated to the isolation and treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Cairo University Hospitals. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples and radiologic evidence of pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the 177 patients admitted to the ICUs during the study period, 160 patients had COVID-19 pneumonia and were included in the analysis (mean age: 60 +/- 14 years, 67.5% males); 23% of patients had no known comorbidities. The overall ICU and hospital mortality rates were both 24.4%. The ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 7 (25-75% interquartile range: 4-10) and 10 (25-75% interquartile range: 7-14) days, respectively. In a multivariable analysis with in-hospital death as the dependent variable, ischemic heart disease, history of smoking, and secondary bacterial pneumonia were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death, whereas greater PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission to the ICU was associated with a lower risk. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, ischemic heart disease, history of smoking, and secondary bacterial pneumonia were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death.

34222459	Low symptomatic COVID-19 in an elderly patient with follicular lymphoma treated with rituximab-based immunotherapy: A case report. BACKGROUND: Follicular lymphoma is an indolent lymphoma that may progress to a highly aggressive form requiring immunochemotherapy. Most regimens utilize rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, which may affect the clinical course of novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)]. Here we describe the first case of mild COVID-19 during ongoing oncological treatment without significant deterioration after rituximab administration. CASE SUMMARY: A 74-year-old female with an enlargement of her right palatine tonsil was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma following tonsillectomy and started immunochemotherapy according to the rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone regimen. At home before the fourth cycle, she developed nonspecific symptoms (excessive fatigue, loss of appetite and nausea), misdiagnosed as adverse effects of chemotherapy. Unexpectedly, interim positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan, performed shortly before rituximab administration, revealed previously nonexistent pulmonary changes, potentially of infectious etiology. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by a nasopharyngeal swab (with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test) performed the following day. Despite rituximab infusion, the patient remained oligosymptomatic and was discharged home for self-isolation. Having reached a negative SARS-CoV-2 status before the subsequently scheduled regimen, the patient successfully received six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and obtained complete remission by positron emission tomography-computed tomography. CONCLUSION: Our case shows that rituximab-based immunotherapy due to follicular lymphoma may have no evident negative effect on the COVID-19 clinical course.	Case Report
34290317	Intranasal plus subcutaneous prime vaccination with a dual antigen COVID-19 vaccine elicits T-cell and antibody responses in mice. We have developed a COVID-19 vaccine, hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD, that expresses SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins with modifications to increase immune responses delivered using a human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) platform. Here, we demonstrate subcutaneous (SC) prime and SC boost vaccination of CD-1 mice with this dual-antigen vaccine elicits T-helper cell 1 (Th1) biased T-cell and humoral responses to both S and N that are greater than those seen with hAd5 S wild type delivering only unmodified S. We then compared SC to intranasal (IN) prime vaccination with SC or IN boosts and show that an IN prime with an IN boost is as effective at generating Th1 biased humoral responses as the other combinations tested, but an SC prime with an IN or SC boost elicits greater T cell responses. Finally, we used a combined SC plus IN (SC + IN) prime with or without a boost and found the SC + IN prime alone to be as effective in generating humoral and T-cell responses as the SC + IN prime with a boost. The finding that SC + IN prime-only delivery has the potential to provide broad immunity-including mucosal immunity-against SARS-CoV-2 supports further testing of this vaccine and delivery approach in animal models of viral challenge.

34353356	SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial infection acquired in a French university hospital during the 1st wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a prospective study. BACKGROUND: In healthcare facilities, nosocomial transmissions of respiratory viruses are a major issue. SARS-CoV-2 is not exempt from nosocomial transmission. Our goals were to describe COVID-19 nosocomial cases during the first pandemic wave among patients in a French university hospital and compliance with hygiene measures. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study in Grenoble Alpes University Hospital from 01/03/2020 to 11/05/2020. We included all hospitalised patients with a documented SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Nosocomial case was defined by a delay of 5 days between hospitalisation and first symptoms. Hygiene measures were evaluated between 11/05/2020 and 22/05/2020. Lockdown measures were effective in France on 17/03/2020 and ended on 11/05/2020. Systematic wearing of mask was mandatory for all healthcare workers (HCW) and visits were prohibited in our institution from 13/03/2021 and for the duration of the lockdown period. RESULTS: Among 259 patients included, 14 (5.4%) were considered as nosocomial COVID-19. Median time before symptom onset was 25 days (interquartile range: 12-42). Eleven patients (79%) had risk factors for severe COVID-19. Five died (36%) including 4 deaths attributable to COVID-19. Two clusters were identified. The first cluster had 5 cases including 3 nosocomial acquisitions and no tested HCWs were positive. The second cluster had 3 cases including 2 nosocomial cases and 4 HCWs were positive. Surgical mask wearing and hand hygiene compliance were adequate for 95% and 61% of HCWs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The number of nosocomial COVID-19 cases in our hospital was low. Compliance regarding mask wearing, hand hygiene and lockdown measures drastically reduced transmission of the virus. Monitoring of nosocomial COVID-19 cases during the first wave enabled us to determine to what extent the hygiene measures taken were effective and patients protected. Trial registration Study ethics approval was obtained retrospectively on 30 September 2020 (CECIC Rhone-Alpes-Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, IRB 5891).	Prevention
34285316	Predicting critical state after COVID-19 diagnosis: model development using a large US electronic health record dataset. As the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging healthcare systems worldwide, early identification of patients with a high risk of complication is crucial. We present a prognostic model predicting critical state within 28 days following COVID-19 diagnosis trained on data from US electronic health records (IBM Explorys), including demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, and hospitalization. Out of 15753 COVID-19 patients, 2050 went into critical state or deceased. Non-random train-test splits by time were repeated 100 times and led to a ROC AUC of 0.861 [0.838, 0.883] and a precision-recall AUC of 0.434 [0.414, 0.485] (median and interquartile range). The interpretability analysis confirmed evidence on major risk factors (e.g., older age, higher BMI, male gender, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) in an efficient way compared to clinical studies, demonstrating the model validity. Such personalized predictions could enable fine-graded risk stratification for optimized care management.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34132013	alphaV beta6 Integrin: An Intriguing Target for COVID-19 and Related Diseases. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has been an extraordinary event that constituted a global health emergency. As the novel coronavirus is continuing to spread over the world, the need for therapeutic agents to control this pandemic is increasing. alphaV beta6 Integrin may be an intriguing target not only for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry, but also for the diagnosis/treatment of COVID-19 related fibrosis, an emerging type of fibrotic disease which will probably affect a significant part of the recovered patients. In this short article, the possible role of this integrin for fighting COVID-19 is discussed on the basis of recently published evidence, showing how its underestimated involvement may be interesting for the development of novel pharmacological tools.

34287634	Association Between COVID-19 Exposure and Self-reported Compliance With Public Health Guidelines Among Essential Employees at an Institution of Higher Education in the US. Importance: Detailed analysis of infection rates paired with behavioral and employee-reported risk factors is vital to understanding how transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be exacerbated or mitigated in the workplace. Institutions of higher education are heterogeneous work units that supported continued in-person employment during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a test site for occupational health evaluation. Objective: To evaluate the association between self-reported protective behaviors and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among essential in-person employees during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted from July 13 to September 2, 2020, at an institution of higher education in Fort Collins, Colorado. Employees 18 years or older without symptoms of COVID-19 who identified as essential in-person workers during the first 6 months of the pandemic were included. Participants completed a survey, and blood and nasal swab samples were collected to assess active SARS-CoV-2 infection via quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and past infection by serologic testing. Exposure: Self-reported practice of protective behaviors against COVID-19 according to public health guidelines provided to employees. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of current SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by qRT-PCR or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by an IgG SARS-CoV-2 testing platform. The frequency of protective behavior practices and essential workers' concerns regarding contracting COVID-19 and exposing others were measured based on survey responses. Results: Among 508 participants (305 [60.0%] women, 451 [88.8%] non-Hispanic White individuals; mean [SD] age, 41.1 [12.5] years), there were no qRT-PCR positive test results, and only 2 participants (0.4%) had seroreactive IgG antibodies. Handwashing and mask wearing were reported frequently both at work (480 [94.7%] and 496 [97.8%] participants, respectively) and outside work (465 [91.5%] and 481 [94.7%] participants, respectively). Social distancing was reported less frequently at work (403 [79.5%]) than outside work (465 [91.5%]) (P < .001). Participants were more highly motivated to avoid exposures because of concern about spreading the infection to others (419 [83.0%]) than for personal protection (319 [63.2%]) (P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of essential workers at an institution of higher education, when employees reported compliance with public health practices both at and outside work, they were able to operate safely in their work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

34217416	Modelling the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of population-based colorectal cancer screening. COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected regular public health interventions including population-based cancer screening. Impacts of such screening delays on the changes in structure and screening process and the resultant long-term outcomes are unknown. It is therefore necessary to develop a systematic framework to assess theses impacts related to these components of quality. Using population-based cancer screening with fecal immunochemical test (FIT) as an illustration, the main analysis was to assess how various scenarios of screening delays were associated with the capacity for primary screening and full time equivalent (FTE) for colonoscopy and impact long-term outcomes based on a Markov decision tree model on population level. The second analysis was to quantify how the extent of COVID-19 epidemic measured by social distancing index affected capacity and FTE that were translated to delays with an exponential relationship. COVID-19 epidemic led to 25%, 29%, 34%, and 39% statistically significantly incremental risks of late cancer for the delays of 0.5-year, 1-year,1.5-year, and 2-year, respectively compared with regular biennial FIT screening. The corresponding statistically findings of four delayed schedules for death from colorectal cancer (CRC) were 26%, 28%, 29%, and 30%, respectively. The higher social distancing index led to a lower capacity of uptake screening and a larger reduction of FTE, resulting in longer screening delay and longer waiting time, which further impacted long-term outcomes as above. In summary, a systematic modelling approach was developed for demonstrating the strong impact of screening delays caused by COVID-19 epidemic on long-term outcomes illustrated with a Taiwan population-based FIT screening of CRC.

34206813	Association between Hyperglycemia at Hospital Presentation and Hospital Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients with and without Type 2 Diabetes: A Retrospective Cohort Study of Hospitalized Inner-City COVID-19 Patients. This study aimed to determine the relationships among hyperglycemia (HG), the presence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and the outcomes of COVID-19. Demographic data, blood glucose levels (BG) measured on admission, and hospital outcomes of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Boston University Medical Center from 1 March to 4 August 2020 were extracted from the hospital database. HG was defined as BG > 200 mg/dL. Patients with type 1 diabetes or BG < 70 mg/dL were excluded. A total of 458 patients with T2D and 976 patients without T2D were included in the study. The mean +/- SD age was 56 +/- 17 years and 642 (45%) were female. HG occurred in 193 (42%) and 42 (4%) of patients with and without T2D, respectively. Overall, the in-hospital mortality rate was 9%. Among patients without T2D, HG was statistically significantly associated with mortality, ICU admission, intubation, acute kidney injury, and severe sepsis/septic shock, after adjusting for potential confounders (p < 0.05). However, only ICU admission and acute kidney injury were associated with HG among patients with T2D (p < 0.05). Among the 235 patients with HG, the presence of T2D was associated with decreased odds of mortality, ICU admission, intubation, and severe sepsis/septic shock, after adjusting for potential confounders, including BG (p < 0.05). In conclusion, HG in the subset of patients without T2D could be a strong indicator of high inflammatory burden, leading to a higher risk of severe COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34285195	Three epitope-distinct human antibodies from RenMab mice neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and cooperatively minimize the escape of mutants. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic disease caused by the newly emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 3.8 million deaths to date. Neutralizing antibodies are effective therapeutic measures. However, many naturally occurring mutations at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) have emerged, and some of them can evade existing neutralizing antibodies. Here, we utilized RenMab, a novel mouse carrying the entire human antibody variable region, for neutralizing antibody discovery. We obtained several potent RBD-blocking antibodies and categorized them into four distinct groups by epitope mapping. We determined the involved residues of the epitope of three representative antibodies by cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) studies. Moreover, we performed neutralizing experiments with 50 variant strains with single or combined mutations and found that the mixing of three epitope-distinct antibodies almost eliminated the mutant escape. Our study provides a sound basis for the rational design of fully human antibody cocktails against SARS-CoV-2 and pre-emergent coronaviral threats.	Mechanism;Treatment
34132810	Clinician and staff perspectives on potential disparities introduced by the rapid implementation of telehealth services during COVID-19: a mixed-methods analysis. The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly altered ambulatory health care delivery and may have worsened disparities in health care access. To assess the telehealth implementation experiences of ambulatory personnel in different disciplines and their perspectives on potential telehealth disparities, and to make recommendations for more equitable telehealth delivery. We used a convergent parallel mixed-methods design. Clinic managers from geriatric medicine, internal medicine, and psychiatry e-mailed a survey to clinicians and staff regarding experiences with telehealth care delivery. Quantitative survey responses were analyzed with Fisher's Exact tests. Qualitative responses were coded thematically. Recommendations were categorized by type of implementation strategy. Quantitative and qualitative findings on telehealth disparities were merged in a joint data display. Respondents (n = 147, 57% response rate) were distributed across three specialties: 66% internal medicine, 19% psychiatry, and 14% geriatric medicine. Prior to 2020, 77% of clinicians had never delivered telehealth services. By Spring 2020, 78% reported conducting more than half of clinic visits by telehealth. Among clinicians, 52% agreed/strongly agreed that rapid telehealth implementation exacerbated access to care disparities to: older adult patients, those with limited internet access, and those needing interpretation services. Staff expressed similar difficulties with telehealth set-up especially for these patients. To improve telehealth equity, clinicians recommended to: (i) change infrastructure; (ii) train and educate stakeholders; and (iii) support clinicians. Clinicians and staff reported specific subpopulations had challenges in accessing telehealth visits. To avoid perpetuating telehealth access disparities, further co-discovery of equitable implementation strategies with patients and clinics are urgently needed.	Prevention
34217815	SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with beta-thalassemia: The French experience. INTRODUCTION: Because of iron overload complications, thrombosis and infectious predisposition, patients with severe forms of thalassemia are likely to be at increased risk of COVID-19 complications. RESULTS: A national survey conducted during the year 2020 across the French reference centers for hemoglobinopathies identified 16 cases of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR in beta-thalassemia patients. Their age ranged from 11 months to 60 years. 15 patients were transfusion-dependent and 6 were splenectomized. Concerning iron overload related complications, none had diabetes or cirrhosis and only one had experienced heart failure. All 4 pediatric patients were pauci-symptomatic during the viral episode. Three patients (41, 49 and 57 years old) developed COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy without the need for mechanical ventilation. Neutropenia (absolute neutrophils count <0.5 10 (9)/L) was observed in 2 patients receiving long-term treatment with hydroxycarbamide and deferiprone. No thrombosis event, organ failure or death occurred. All patients recovered. CONCLUSION: Severity of COVID-19 in this population of young and middle-aged patients appeared increased compared to the general population but remained mild to moderate as already described in the few series reported in the literature. Occurrence of adverse events related to chronic treatment administered in thalassemia disease may be favored by the infectious episode.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34288954	SARS-CoV-2 percent positivity and risk factors among people with HIV at an urban academic medical center. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been unclear how vulnerable people with HIV (PwH) are to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We sought to determine if PwH are more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than people without HIV, and to identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity among PwH. We conducted a cross-sectional study in which we collected electronic medical record data for all patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing at an academic medical center. Presence of HIV and other chronic diseases were based on the presence of ICD-10 diagnosis codes. We calculated the percent positivity for SARS-CoV-2 among PwH and among people without HIV. Among PwH, we compared demographic factors, comorbidities, HIV viral load, CD4 T-cell count, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens between those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those who tested negative. Comparisons were made using chi squared tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Multivariate models were created using logistic regression. Among 69,763 people tested for SARS-CoV-2, 0.6% (431) were PwH. PwH were not significantly more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than people without HIV (7.2% (31/431) vs 8.4% (5820/69763), p = 0.35), but were more likely to be younger, Black, and male (p-values < .0001). There were no significant differences in HIV clinical factors, chronic diseases, or ART regimens among PwH testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 versus those testing negative. In our sample, PwH were not more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, despite being more likely to be members of demographic groups known to be at higher risk for infection. Differences between PwH who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those who tested negative were only seen in Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (non-Hispanic or Latino vs unknown Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (OR 0.2 95% CI (0.6, 0.9)) and site of testing(inpatient vs outpatient OR 3.1 95% CI (1.3, 7.4)).

34215216	Improvements in clinical signs of Parkinson's disease using photobiomodulation: a prospective proof-of-concept study. BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no cure and few treatment options. Its incidence is increasing due to aging populations, longer disease duration and potentially as a COVID-19 sequela. Photobiomodulation (PBM) has been successfully used in animal models to reduce the signs of PD and to protect dopaminergic neurons. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of PBM to mitigate clinical signs of PD in a prospective proof-of-concept study, using a combination of transcranial and remote treatment, in order to inform on best practice for a larger randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: Twelve participants with idiopathic PD were recruited. Six were randomly chosen to begin 12 weeks of transcranial, intranasal, neck and abdominal PBM. The remaining 6 were waitlisted for 14 weeks before commencing the same treatment. After the 12-week treatment period, all participants were supplied with PBM devices to continue home treatment. Participants were assessed for mobility, fine motor skills, balance and cognition before treatment began, after 4 weeks of treatment, after 12 weeks of treatment and the end of the home treatment period. A Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was used to assess treatment effectiveness at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Measures of mobility, cognition, dynamic balance and fine motor skill were significantly improved (p < 0.05) with PBM treatment for 12 weeks and up to one year. Many individual improvements were above the minimal clinically important difference, the threshold judged to be meaningful for participants. Individual improvements varied but many continued for up to one year with sustained home treatment. There was a demonstrable Hawthorne Effect that was below the treatment effect. No side effects of the treatment were observed. CONCLUSIONS: PBM was shown to be a safe and potentially effective treatment for a range of clinical signs and symptoms of PD. Improvements were maintained for as long as treatment continued, for up to one year in a neurodegenerative disease where decline is typically expected. Home treatment of PD by the person themselves or with the help of a carer might be an effective therapy option. The results of this study indicate that a large RCT is warranted.

34226801	A critical review on environmental presence of pharmaceutical drugs tested for the covid-19 treatment. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The outbreak caused a worldwide impact, becoming a health threat to the general population and its professionals. To date, there are no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines for the COVID-19 infection, however, some drugs are being clinically tested. The use of these drugs on large scale raises great concern about their imminent environmental risk, since the elimination of these compounds by feces and urine associated with the inefficiency of sewage treatment plants in their removal can result in their persistence in the environment, putting in risk the health of humans and of other species. Thus, the goal of this work was to conduct a review of other studies that evaluated the presence of the drugs chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ivermectin, dexamethasone, remdesivir, favipiravir and some HIV antivirals in the environment. The research indicated the presence of these drugs in the environment in different regions, with concentration data that could serve as a basis for further comparative studies following the pandemic.

34293161	Low vitamin D levels and prognosis in a COVID-19 paediatric population: a systematic review. AIM: We aim to study the relationship between vitamin D level, risk and severity of COVID-19 infection in pediatric population through systematic review. METHODS: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar from December 2019 to June 2021 for retrieving articles studying association between vitamin D deficiency with COVID-19. Qualitative details were synthesized in evidence table and quantitative data was used for deriving pooled estimate through meta-analysis. RESULTS: After initial search of 2261 articles, eight eligible studies (two reviews) were included in the systematic review. Meta-analysis of the quantitative data (six studies) showed pooled prevalence of vitamin D deficiency as 45.91% (95% CI : 25.148-67.450). In infected pediatric patients, low levels of vitamin D increased the risk of severe disease (odds ratio - 5.5; 95% CI : 1.560- 19.515; p = 0.008). It was also found that children and adolescents having vitamin D deficiency had greater risk of COVID infection as compared to patients with normal vitamin D levels. Improvement in disease severity with vitamin D supplementation was also noted. CONCLUSION: The systematic review showed that almost half of the pediatric COVID patients suffer from vitamin D deficiency. It is also clear that the low level of vitamin D is associated with greater risk of infection and poorer outcome in pediatrics.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34219981	SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1: Ein kleines Protein blockiert die Immunantwort. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate its own replication and avoid immune control, SARS-CoV-2 manipulates its target cells. Our results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) plays a key role in viral immune evasion. It blocks the mRNA tunnel of the cellular ribosome, resulting in a shutdown of translation and strong attenuation of the host's antiviral immune response.	Mechanism
34373725	COVID-19 pandemic and reasons to prioritize the needs of the health care system to ensure its sustainability: A scoping review from January to October 2020 (Review). The worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led the World Health Organization to characterize the pandemic as a public health emergency of international concern. National health care systems in countries during the initial surge of the pandemic were unable to handle the sanitarian crisis that had emerged. Thus, the prevention and control of future global health emergencies must be a priority. The present scoping review aimed to retrieve articles that summarize the current experience on issues related to historical knowledge, and epidemiology, clinical features and overall burden of SARS-CoV-2 on health care services. In summary, a comprehensive overview of the information that has been learnt during this period is presented in the current review. Furthermore, taking into account the global experience, the need for planning cohesive and functional health services before similar pandemic events occur in the future is highlighted. The next public health issue should be prevented rather than treated. In spite of the vaccination benefits, a number of sporadic cases of SARS-CoV-2infections will persist. Information collected remains relevant for appraising how similar threats can be faced in the future. Overall, collaborative health care plans need to be rethought to increase preparedness.

34220066	The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Disease Severity and Quality of Life in Parkinson's Disease. Background: The challenges being faced during the lockdown period may worsen motor or non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Objective: This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of lockdown on the disease activity, caregiver perceptions and the quality of life of patients with PD. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from June till September 2020. Sixty-four patients with PD and caregivers were interviewed telephonically after obtaining consent. The responses were recorded by means of a structured questionnaire. Non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) and the Parkinson Disease Questinnaire-8 (PDQ-8) were applied. PDQ-8 severity index (PDQ-8 SI) scores were expressed as percentage of the raw PDQ-8 score of the total score. Data were analsyed by using SPSS version 20.0. Results: Of 64 patients, 39 (60.9%) were men and 25 (39.1%) were women. The overall median age of the patients was 65 (55.25-69.75) years. The median duration was 48 (30-84) months. Twenty-six (40.6%) patients reported symptomatic worsening during the lockdown period. Slowness in activities of daily living and walking worsened in 15 (57.7%) and 14 (53.8%) patients, respectively, while tremors increased in 12 (46.2%) patients. Mood and sleep disturbances were the most common non-motor symptoms to worsen. Increase in non-motor symptoms and the NMSS total score were independent predictors of PDQ-8 scores. Increase in non-motor symptoms during the lockdown was an independent predictor of the highest quartile of PDQ-8 SI scores. Conclusions: Motor and non-motor symptoms have worsened in patients with PD during the lockdown. The increase in non-motor symptoms was independently associated with poorer quality of life among patients with PD during the lockdown.	Prevention
34341671	COVID-19 post-mortem findings: how the departed can teach us. We present an asthmatic 39 year old female frontline healthcare worker in contact with COVID-19 patients, who suffered from respiratory problems for a few days, after which she was found dead by her spouse. Post-mortem (PM) examination showed lung consolidation and histological evidence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), in form of hyaline membrane disease, as well as atypical cells, thrombi and fibrin plugs inside pulmonary capillaries. Swab sample testing for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed the infection status. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus which first emerged in Wuhan, China, and PM is contributing immensely to uncovering the pathophysiological mechanism of this disease. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and can lead to a fatal pneumonia characterised histologically by DAD (the most consistent PM finding). This is due to invasion by the virus of type II pneumocytes, which leads to the death of both type I and II pneumocytes and increased capillary permeability. This compromises gas exchange which can lead eventually to cardiorespiratory failure and death.	Case Report
34284038	"Abnormal MRI findings of the orbital or visual pathways in patients with severe COVID-19: Observations from the French multicenter COVID-19 cohort. OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 is a multisystemic disease. Ophthalmological abnormalities are relatively rare among COVID-19-infected patients. The aim of our study was to report orbital and visual pathways MRI findings in a nationwide multicenter cohort of patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: This IRB-approved retrospective multi-center study included participants presenting with severe COVID-19, who underwent brain MRI from March 4th to May 1st 2020. Two neuroradiologists (""blinded""), blinded to all data, individually analyzed morphological MRIs focusing on the orbits and the visual pathways. A second consensus reading session was performed in the case of disagreement between both readers. Clinical and ophthalmological data were compared to MRI findings. Descriptive statistical analysis and interobserver agreement for MRI reading using non-weighted Cohen kappa statistics were performed. RESULTS: 129 participants (43 [33%] women and 86 [67%] men, mean age 63 +/- 14 years) were included in the study. 17/129 (13%) patients had abnormal MRI findings of the orbit or visual pathways. 11/17 (65%) patients had a FLAIR-WI hyperintense optic disc. 6/17 (35%) patients had abnormal signal of at least one of the visual pathway structures: 6/6 (100%) of the optic nerve, 1/6 (17%) of the optic chiasm, 2/6 (33%) of the optic tract and 1/6 (17%) of the optic radiations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that a substantial number of patients with severe COVID-19 presented with abnormal MRI findings of the orbit or visual pathways, which might lead to potentially severe visual impairment."

34354889	Coronavirus Disease-Associated Mucormycosis from a Tertiary Care Hospital in India: A Case Series. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains a health concern with new challenges emerging as the pandemic progresses. The recent rise of opportunistic infections especially mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients is further complicating their outcomes. Mucormycosis is well known to infect patients with diabetes mellitus, malignancy, chemotherapy, and other immunocompromised conditions. The treatment of COVID-19 largely remains systemic steroids and other immunomodulators that add to the risk of invasive fungal infection. METHODOLOGY: Here, we present a retrospective case series of 13 patients with individual clinical characteristics along with the demography and treatment details. The data were collected retrospectively in a single center that caters to a large population of COVID-19 patients with varying severity. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were presented with COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM). The median age was higher in non-survivors (49.5 years), with a higher odds of death (23.8) in those with severe COVID, having overall mortality of 64.3%. Moreover, diabetes mellitus was present in 61.5% of patients with a mortality of 75%. About 11 (84.6%) patients had received prior steroids for COVID-19. The incidence of hyperglycemia at admission was equal among both survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of mucormycosis seems to be increasing among COVID-19 patients which may be associated with increased use of steroids, the possible immunocompromised state imposed by SARS-CoV-2, or co-existing conditions such as diabetes mellitus. The mortality of CAM is remarkably high and apart from preventive practices and rational use of immunomodulators, a high index of suspicion with early diagnosis would be key to survival.	Case Report
34211186	Immunological mechanisms of vaccine-induced protection against COVID-19 in humans. Most COVID-19 vaccines are designed to elicit immune responses, ideally neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Several vaccines, including mRNA, adenoviral-vectored, protein subunit and whole-cell inactivated virus vaccines, have now reported efficacy in phase III trials and have received emergency approval in many countries. The two mRNA vaccines approved to date show efficacy even after only one dose, when non-NAbs and moderate T helper 1 cell responses are detectable, but almost no NAbs. After a single dose, the adenovirus vaccines elicit polyfunctional antibodies that are capable of mediating virus neutralization and of driving other antibody-dependent effector functions, as well as potent T cell responses. These data suggest that protection may require low levels of NAbs and might involve other immune effector mechanisms including non-NAbs, T cells and innate immune mechanisms. Identifying the mechanisms of protection as well as correlates of protection is crucially important to inform further vaccine development and guide the use of licensed COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.

34214773	Can isolated sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and idiopathic acute facial paralysis (Bell's palsy) be symptoms of COVID-19? OBJECTIVES: The symptoms of COVID-19 at the time of presentation mainly include fever, cough, respiratory distress and myalgia. On the other hand, as neurological symptoms, disruption of taste and smell and cerebrovascular pathologies are well-known, whereas other neurological symptoms and signs are being newly recognized. Sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and idiopathic acute facial paralysis (Bell's palsy) are otologic emergencies that are frequently encountered by otorhinolaryngology specialists. Although there are many articles describing SSNHL and Bell's palsy in the literature, the literature describing their relationship to COVID-19 is limited. In our study, we aimed to present the neuro-otologic relationship of SSNHL and Bell's palsy with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The pretreatment real-time oronasopharyngeal PCR tests, COVID-19 symptomatology and COVID-19 infection statuses of patients who presented to our clinic with isolated SSNHL and Bell's palsy between April 2020 and April 2021 were questioned, and the data of the patients were collected. Throughout their treatment, the patients were followed-up in terms of COVID-19 infection. This is a prospective study. Moreover, to observe the change in the incidence, the data of patients visiting between January 2019 and January 2020 were also collected. The data of the patients were statistically analyzed using SPSS. RESULTS: The study included a total of 177 patients. The SSNHL group consisted of 91 patients, and the Bell's palsy group consisted of 86 patients. Neither group showed a statistically significant difference in comparison to the year without the pandemic in terms of the patient numbers (incidence), sex, age, morbidity, response to treatment or social habits. There was a statistically significant difference in age only in the Bell's palsy group, but this difference was not medically significant. CONCLUSION: As a result of our study, we did not observe a relationship between COVID-19 and cases of SSNHL and Bell's palsy. It is recommended to apply standard otologic treatment to isolated SSNHL and Bell's palsy patients whose association with COVID-19 is not determined.	Diagnosis
34288642	Airway and Alveoli Organoids as Valuable Research Tools in COVID-19. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, affects tissues from different body systems but mostly the respiratory system, and the damage evoked in the lungs may occasionally result in severe respiratory complications and eventually lead to death. Studies of human respiratory infections have been limited by the scarcity of functional models that mimic in vivo physiology and pathophysiology. In the last decades, organoid models have emerged as potential research tools due to the possibility of reproducing in vivo tissue in culture. Despite being studied for over one year, there is still no effective treatment against COVID-19, and investigations using pulmonary tissue and possible therapeutics are still very limited. Thus, human lung organoids can provide robust support to simulate SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication and aid in a better understanding of their effects in human tissue. The present review describes methodological aspects of different protocols to develop airway and alveoli organoids, which have a promising perspective to further investigate COVID-19.	Treatment
34217786	Esophagectomy for Esophageal Cancer Performed During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Delay in time to esophagectomy for esophageal cancer has been shown to have worse peri-operative and long-term outcomes. We hypothesized that COVID-19 would cause a delay to surgery, with worse perioperative outcomes, compared to standard operations. All esophagectomies for esophageal cancer at a single institution from March-June 2020, COVID-19 group, and from 2019 were reviewed and peri-operative details were compared between groups. Ninety-six esophagectomies were performed in 2019 vs 37 during March-June 2020 (COVID-19 group). No differences between groups were found for preoperative comorbidities. Wait-time to surgery from final neoadjuvant treatment was similar, median 50 days in 2019 vs 53 days during COVID-19 p = 0.601. There was no increased upstaging, from clinical stage to pathologic stage, 9.4% in 2019 vs 7.5% in COVID-19 p = 0.841. Fewer overall complications occurred during COVID-19 vs 2019, 43.2% vs 64.6% p = 0.031, but complications were similar by specific grades. Readmission rates were not statistically different during COVID-19 than 2019, 16.2% vs 10.4% p = 0.38. No peri-operative mortalities or COVID-19 infections were seen in the COVID-19 group. Esophagectomy for esophageal cancer was not associated with worse outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic with minimal risk of infection when careful COVID-19 guidelines are followed. Prioritization is recommended to ensure no delays to surgery.	Prevention

34283506	Best Practices For Administering Monoclonal Antibody Therapy For Coronavirus (COVID-19) COVID-19 is a clinical syndrome due to infection with SARS-CoV-2. It has been discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and spread to a pandemic level in 2020. Globally it has affected more than 168 million people, with a death toll of more than 3.5 million patients. In the United States, the number of cases is more than 32 million, and the number of people who died from COVID-19 exceeded 586,000 patients (WHO Coronavirus dashboard as of 05/28/2021). Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 is one of the coronaviruses, single-stranded RNA viruses with close resemblance to the SARS outbreak of 2003.[1] SARS-CoV-2 differs from MERS(middle east respiratory syndrome) and SARS(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)coronaviruses by easier spread and lower fatality rate.[2] SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by inhalation of air carrying droplets or from person to person through droplets spread by coughing, sneezing, singing, shouting, or even talking. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected on multiple services, and touching mucous membranes with hands contaminated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus may also be another transmission source. COVID -19 starts after an incubation period of around 5 days after exposure but could range from 2 to 14 days, and most of the patients can identify recent contact with COVID 19 patients. The clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic cases to severe symptoms of fatigue, headache, anosmia (loss of smell sensation), ageusia(loss of taste sensation), dyspnea, and dry cough that is persistent and may stimulate gag reflex and induce vomiting. Hypoxia that may worsen to require assisted ventilation, whether invasive or non-invasive. The physical signs include fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia, resulting in acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Extrapulmonary manifestations have been described in many COVID patients, in multiple organ systems, including but not limited to:cutaneous: acral lesions, cardiovascular: myocardial injury and myocarditis, neurologic: headache and stroke, gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and elevated liver enzymes.[3] The national institute of Health classifies the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 as follows: Asymptomatic or Presymptomatic Infection: positive testing for SARS-CoV-2 but no symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Mild Illness: Individuals who have any of the various signs and symptoms of COVID-19 but do not have shortness of breath, dyspnea, or abnormal chest imaging. Moderate Illness: the presence of lower respiratory disease and no hypoxia( oxygen saturation (SpO) >/=94% on room air). Severe Illness: Hypoxia, Spo <94% on room air, a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO/FiO) <300 mm Hg, respiratory frequency >30 breaths/min, or lung infiltrates >50%. Critical Illness: Individuals who have respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction. Mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 are usually managed on an outpatient basis. Patients requiring oxygen therapy to maintain their oxygenation are usually hospitalized and may require intensive care management for assisted ventilation, organ support, and treatment of secondary infection. Management of non hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the outpatient setting involves triaging the severity of symptoms and oxygen requirements. Identifying patients with risk factors for deterioration and close monitoring. Patients without risk factors for deterioration are usually managed with supportive care and self-monitoring. Meanwhile, patients with risk factors for deterioration are offered Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies.	Diagnosis;Transmission;Treatment
34217752	Broad spectrum anti-coronavirus activity of a series of anti-malaria quinoline analogues. In this study, a series of 10 quinoline analogues was evaluated for their in vitro antiviral activity against a panel of alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2), as well as the human coronaviruses (HCoV) 229E and OC43. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were the most potent with antiviral EC50 values in the range of 0.12-12 muM. Chloroquine displayed the most favorable selectivity index (i.e. ratio cytotoxic versus antiviral concentration), being 165 for HCoV-OC43 in HEL cells. Potent anti-coronavirus activity was also observed with amodiaquine, ferroquine and mefloquine, although this was associated with substantial cytotoxicity for mefloquine. Primaquine, quinidine, quinine and tafenoquine only blocked coronavirus replication at higher concentrations, while piperaquine completely lacked antiviral and cytotoxic effects. A time-of-addition experiment in HCoV-229E-infected HEL cells revealed that chloroquine interferes with viral entry at a post-attachment stage. Using confocal microscopy, no viral RNA synthesis could be detected upon treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with chloroquine. The inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine coincided with an inhibitory effect on the autophagy pathway as visualized by a dose-dependent increase in LC3-positive puncta. The latter effect was less pronounced or even absent with the other quinolines. In summary, we showed that several quinoline analogues, including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, amodiaquine, ferroquine and mefloquine, exhibit broad anti-coronavirus activity in vitro.

34344427	Green tea intake and its effect on laboratory parameters and disease symptoms in hospitalised patients with Covid 19: a structured protocol for a randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: The current randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to assess the effect of green tea intake on disease symptoms and laboratory parameters including C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and complete blood count (CBC) in patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 infection. TRIAL DESIGN: Randomized, double-blinded, parallel (1:1 ratio) clinical trial exploratory study PARTICIPANTS: We will recruit patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to Yasuj Shahid Jalil Hospital in Yasuj City, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Iran. Participants' inclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion Criteria Patients aged >/=18 years COVID-19 diagnosis according to real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Exclusion Criteria Pregnancy or lactation Disseminated intravascular coagulation or any other types of coagulopathy Severe congestive kidney failure Having a history of participating in a clinical trial during the last 30 days INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: Two capsules containing 450 mg green tea extract along with routine treatment for COVID-19 patients in the intervention group. Two capsules containing placebo plus routine treatment for patients with COVID-19 infection. Capsules will be taken twice a day, after lunch and dinner, for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOMES: Changes in disease symptoms and laboratory parameters including CRP, ESR, and CBC after 14 days of the intervention compared to control group. RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be randomly assigned into the intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio.

34212790	A simple prognostic score for COVID-19 hospitalized patients developing deep vein thrombosis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to analyze the specificity, accuracy and sensitivity of a simple, easy to calculate, prognostic score for hospitalized COVID19 patients developing deep vein thrombosis. METHODS: From March 1st to April 28th, 942 COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms were admitted to the hospital San Matteo of Pavia-Italy. Thirty two patients (3.4%) developed deep vein thrombosis during hospitalization. In all patients hemostatic and inflammatory parameters were abnormal. A simple prognostic score was developed based on the presence of specific co morbidities and D-dimers levels (quick San Matthew Score-quick SMS). RESULTS: Nine patients died in a condition of multiple organ failure, 23 patients (71.9%) survived and left the hospital in good general conditions. The developed score was based simply on two parameters: 1) presence of four specific co morbidities and 2)systemic levels of D-Dimers. The quick San Matthew Score resulted in a sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of more than 90% (94%, 92%,93% respectively) and compared favorably with other scores. The score was prospectively validated in 100 COVID19 patients who developed deep vein thrombosis collected from the literature and prospectively confirmed in our hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study underline the importance of an immediate aggressive therapeutic approach for moderate and high-risk patients with COVID19 infection. The quick SMS score may help to identify patients at high risk for mortality and to follow the clinical outcome of the patient. A simple, easy to calculate prognostic score may also facilitate communication among health workers.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34219921	Screening for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR and serological testing in asymptomatic healthcare workers. The prevalence and seroconversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic health care workers in the US is unclear. Our study utilized real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 testing and serological evaluation to detect IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in asymptomatic health care workers. A total of 197 subjects with a mean age of 35 years were recruited into the study. While most (67%) reported prolonged contact with known COVID-19 patients, only 8 (4.2%) tested positive on RT-PCR and 23 (11.7%) had detectable levels of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2. Out of 19 subjects with detectable IgG antibody at week 1, 11 (57.9%) lost their antibody response by week 3. No statistically significant difference was found in baseline characteristics or exposure status between subjects with positive and negative results on RT-PCR or antibody positivity. In conclusion, we found a low incidence of PCR positivity for SARS-CoV-2 in a high-risk group. This likely demonstrates the effectiveness of proper personal protective equipment use and low transmission risk in health care settings. The detectable IgG antibody titer was low, and a significant portion of subjects lost their antibody response on repeat testing. This may mean that antibody response in asymptomatic patients is categorically different than in symptomatic hospitalized patients with COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34201473	Diabetes Mellitus-A Risk Factor for Unfavourable Outcome in COVID-19 Patients-The Experience of an Infectious Diseases Regional Hospital. Early research into the implications concerning the evolution of the infection caused by the new coronavirus in people with glucose metabolism dysfunction, in this case diabetics, shows that severe forms of the disease predominate in this risk category. Moreover, it seems that even in patients with normal glycaemic status, COVID-19 may predispose to the development of hyperglycaemia which modulates immune mechanisms and inflammatory responses, with direct effects on morbidity and mortality. Thus, taking into account these scientific data, as well as the increased frequency of diabetes in the general population, we aimed to assess the risk of an unfavourable outcome of diabetic patients, which is in a strong connection with the presence and severity of pulmonary disease such as interstitial pneumonia/bronchopneumonia, as well as the effectiveness of Tocilizumab administration. The results of our study indicate a three-fold higher risk of death in patients with diabetes and COVID-19 (RR = 3.03; IC95%: 2.37-3.86; p = 0.001),compared to nondiabetic patients, and the risk of developing severe forms of acute respiratory failure was 1.5 times higher in the first studied category. In conclusion, we can say that the diabetic diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection is more predisposed to immunological and organic dysfunctions that may ultimately result in death, and treatment with monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibodies was more effective in diabetic patients than non-diabetics (p < 0.05). The effectiveness of Tocilizumab was significant in both studied groups, but diabetic patients responded better to this therapy compared to non-diabetes-mellitus (DM) ones (76.7% vs. 35% p = 0.001).

34227079	"Post COVID syndrome: a new challenge for medicine. The huge concern raised by SARS-CoV2 pandemic about public health management and social impact is still under debate, particularly because COVID-19 may affect infected people much longer than expected from a typical air-borne viral disease. The scientific community is actually wondering about the etiopathogenesis and clinical development of this ""post-COVID"" complex symptomatology, very close to symptoms typically observed in chronic fatigue syndrome, so recently named as ""post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC)"". This commentary tries to focus on the most recent news about this issue."	Diagnosis
34375571	Low morbidity in Danish patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorder infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. BACKGROUND: Manifestations and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are not well documented in patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorder (CVID). METHODS: A Danish nationwide retrospective clinician-reported survey. RESULTS: Eleven patients with CVID and SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. The median age was 50 years (range 22-72). All were on immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Eight patients had other pre-existing co-morbidities. Three patients were asymptomatic during the SARS-CoV-2 infection while seven developed mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). One patient had more severe disease with hypoxia and required oxygen therapy. This patient had multiple co-morbidities including well known risk factors for severe COVID-19. All patients recovered. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that CVID may not be a risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, further monitoring of this immunodeficient population is needed to confirm our observation.

34214116	Characterization of antibody response in asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is causing high morbidity and mortality burden worldwide with unprecedented strain on health care systems. To investigate the time course of the antibody response in relation to the outcome we performed a study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. As comparison we also investigated the time course of the antibody response in SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic subjects. Study results show that patients produce a strong antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 with high correlation between different viral antigens (spike protein and nucleoprotein) and among antibody classes (IgA, IgG, and IgM and neutralizing antibodies). The antibody peak is reached by 3 weeks from hospital admission followed by a sharp decrease. No difference was observed in any parameter of the antibody classes, including neutralizing antibodies, between subjects who recovered or with fatal outcome. Only few asymptomatic subjects developed antibodies at detectable levels.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
34201847	Cell Death in Coronavirus Infections: Uncovering Its Role during COVID-19. Cell death mechanisms are crucial to maintain an appropriate environment for the functionality of healthy cells. However, during viral infections, dysregulation of these processes can be present and can participate in the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease. In this review, we describe some features of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and some immunopathogenic mechanisms characterizing the present coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Lymphopenia and monocytopenia are important contributors to COVID-19 immunopathogenesis. The fine mechanisms underlying these phenomena are still unknown, and several hypotheses have been raised, some of which assign a role to cell death as far as the reduction of specific types of immune cells is concerned. Thus, we discuss three major pathways such as apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, and suggest that all of them likely occur simultaneously in COVID-19 patients. We describe that SARS-CoV-2 can have both a direct and an indirect role in inducing cell death. Indeed, on the one hand, cell death can be caused by the virus entry into cells, on the other, the excessive concentration of cytokines and chemokines, a process that is known as a COVID-19-related cytokine storm, exerts deleterious effects on circulating immune cells. However, the overall knowledge of these mechanisms is still scarce and further studies are needed to delineate new therapeutic strategies.	Mechanism;Treatment
34336207	Decline in neutralising antibody responses, but sustained T-cell immunity, in COVID-19 patients at 7 months post-infection. Objectives: This study aimed to explore the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific humoral responses and T-cell responses in patients who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to understand the natural protective immune responses and to facilitate the development of vaccines. Methods: We conducted a combined assessment of the changes in neutralising antibody levels and SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses over time in 27 patients up to 7 months after infection. Results: The neutralising antibody remained detectable in 96.3% of the patients at their second visit at about 7 months post-onset of symptoms. However, their humoral responses, including titres of the spike receptor-binding domain IgG and neutralising antibody, decreased significantly compared with those at first clinic visit. By contrast, the proportions of spike-specific CD4(+) T cells, but not CD8(+) T cells, in COVID-19 patients after recovery were persistently higher than those in healthy controls. No significant change was observed in the proportion of spike-specific CD4(+) T cells in patients who had recovered from COVID-19 within 7 months. Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immune responses persisted, while the neutralising antibodies decayed. Further studies are needed to extend the longevity of neutralising antibodies and to evaluate whether these T cells are sufficient to protect patients from reinfection.	Mechanism;Treatment;Diagnosis
34228987	SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein enhances ACE2 expression via facilitating Interferon effects in bronchial epithelium. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we focused on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host Type I Interferon (IFN) response, so as to identify whether IFN effects could be influenced by the products of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: All the structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were transfected and overexpressed in the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B respectively, and typical antiviral IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) ISG15 expression was detected by qRT-PCR. RNA-seq based transcriptome analysis was performed between control and Spike (S) protein-overexpressed BEAS-2B cells. The expression of ACE2 and IFN effector JAK-STAT signaling activation were detected in control and S protein-overexpressed BEAS-2B cells by qRT-PCR or/and Western blot respectively. The interaction between S protein with STAT1 and STAT2, and the association between JAK1 with downstream STAT1 and STAT2 were measured in BEAS-2B cells by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). RESULTS: S protein could activate IFN effects and downstream ISGs expression. By transcriptome analysis, overexpression of S protein induced a set of genes expression, including series of ISGs and the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Mechanistically, S protein enhanced the association between the upstream JAK1 and downstream STAT1 and STAT2, so as to promote STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation and ACE2 expression. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 S protein enhances ACE2 expression via facilitating IFN effects, which may help its infection.	Mechanism;Treatment
34352195	Bloodstream Infection Risk, Incidence, and Deaths for Hospitalized Patients during Coronavirus Disease Pandemic. Hospital-acquired infections are emerging major concurrent conditions during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We conducted a retrospective review of hospitalizations during MarchOctober 2020 of adults tested by reverse transcription PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We evaluated associations of COVID-19 diagnosis with risk for laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infections (LCBIs, primary outcome), time to LCBI, and risk for death by using logistic and competing risks regression with adjustment for relevant covariates. A total of 10,848 patients were included in the analysis: 918 (8.5%) were given a diagnosis of COVID-19, and 232 (2.1%) had LCBIs during their hospitalization. Of these patients, 58 (25%) were classified as having central lineassociated bloodstream infections. After adjusting for covariates, COVID-19positive status was associated with higher risk for LCBI and death. Reinforcement of infection control practices should be implemented in COVID-19 wards, and review of superiority and inferiority ranking methods by National Healthcare Safety Network criteria might be needed.

34213046	Patient satisfaction and acceptability with telehealth at specialist medical outpatient clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. BACKGROUND: Outpatient clinics were shifted rapidly to telehealth in Australia during the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, drastically altering patient care and experience. AIMS: To investigate patient satisfaction and acceptability of telehealth consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Prospective observation study conducted in two hospital rheumatology outpatient departments (OPD) undertaking telehealth consultations during COVID-19. A modified version of a validated telehealth evaluation survey was posted to all patients attending the telehealth OPD rheumatology clinics, including balanced 5-point Likert scales and free-text responses. Cluster analysis was applied to the Likert-scale questions, alongside thematic analysis of free-text responses. RESULTS: There were 128 respondents (29% response rate), of which 69.5% were women and the majority (87.5%) was aged 50 years or older. All telehealth consultations were conducted by telephone. Nearly one-fifth of patients indicated consistent dissatisfaction with telehealth across the range of questions. These patients were older, reported lower educational qualifications and lower health literacy scores and lacked access to the Internet. While many patients found this mode of consultation to be convenient, patients expressed concerns regarding absence of physical examination. A recurrent theme was a desire for a mixed-model clinic in the future, with flexibility of having both telehealth and face-to-face consultations. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers unique insights into patients' experiences with telehealth, which until the current global pandemic, has been an uncommon mode of consultation delivery in urban areas. This study suggests when defining the place of telehealth in future healthcare delivery, patient perspective and careful patient selection will be key. Disease progression, language and cognitive ability, health literacy, technology access and patient and clinician preference are important considerations when deciding how effectively to embed and integrate telehealth into consultations.

34204602	The Impact of the First 2020 COVID-19 Lockdown on the Metabolic Control of Patients with Phenylketonuria. The present study assessed patients' metabolic control of phenylketonuria (PKU) during the first 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Poland. Blood (phenylalanine) Phe results of the tests of 535 patients, performed in 2019 and in the first months of 2020, were analysed. The six-week lockdown period was compared to the preceding six-week period as well as to the two corresponding periods of 2019 (three non-lockdown periods). More patients failed to perform Phe tests in the lockdown period (32.7%) than in non-lockdown periods (15.6%, 15.1%, 17.2%; p < 0.001 for all). The median Phe levels for those patients who performed testing in all the four periods did not differ between periods. However, these patients tended to perform only one test during the lockdown (ORs: 1.43 to 1.60; 95% CI: from 1.01-2.04 to 1.11-2.30, p-value 0.02 to 0.005). Patients who did not take blood during the lockdown (46.7%) performed significantly fewer blood tests in the remaining periods (median <IQR>: 1 <0-1> vs. 2 <1-4>; p < 0.001). In conclusion, direct assessment of patients' compliance based upon Phe levels during the pandemic lockdown was not possible. Pre-pandemic non-compliant patients frequently failed to perform the test during the lockdown, whereas the previously compliant ones were more likely to perform only one test. This strongly suggests that metabolic control might have worsened.	Prevention
34285519	Clinical Efficacy of Corticosteroids in the Early Stages of Deterioration in COVID-19 Pneumonia. Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) strongly suggests using corticosteroids in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Similarly, a large randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) in the UK found that dexamethasone effectively reduced the mortality rate in severe COVID-19 patients. However, the safety profile of corticosteroids has been a controversial area of study. Case Description: A case of a COVID-19 patient is described and the clinical characteristics are observed as the mildly symptomatic patient progresses into a critically ill patient and during their dramatic improvement with corticosteroid therapy in the early stage of the deterioration process with COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusion: The most suitable timing and dosage for the use of corticosteroids to maximize its effect during the worsening of COVID-19 pneumonia are discussed. One of the main pathophysiological hypotheses for severe COVID-19 patients is related to cytokine storm and virus load, which can be effectively treated with corticosteroid therapy.	Case Report

34204163	Towards Goals to Refine Prophylactic and Therapeutic Strategies Against COVID-19 Linked to Aging and Metabolic Syndrome. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) gave rise to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A strong correlation has been demonstrated between worse COVID-19 outcomes, aging, and metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is primarily derived from obesity-induced systemic chronic low-grade inflammation with numerous complications, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The majority of COVID-19 deaths occurs in people over the age of 65. Individuals with MetS are inclined to manifest adverse disease consequences and mortality from COVID-19. In this review, we examine the prevalence and molecular mechanisms underlying enhanced risk of COVID-19 in elderly people and individuals with MetS. Subsequently, we discuss current progresses in treating COVID-19, including the development of new COVID-19 vaccines and antivirals, towards goals to elaborate prophylactic and therapeutic treatment options in this vulnerable population.

34212400	Projecting the effect of easing societal restrictions on non-COVID-19 emergency demand in the UK: Statistical inference using public mobility data. While it is well established that societal restrictions have been effective in reducing COVID-19 emergency demand, evidence also suggests an impact upon emergency demand not directly related to COVID-19 infection. Hospital planning may benefit from a greater understanding of this association and the ability to reliably forecast future levels of non-COVID-19 demand. Activity data for Accident and Emergency (A&E) attendances and emergency admissions were sourced for all hospitals within the Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire healthcare system. These were regressed upon publicly available mobility data obtained from Google's Community Mobility Reports for the local area. Seasonal trends were controlled for using time series decomposition. The models were used to predict non-COVID-19 emergency demand under the UK Government's plan to sequentially lift all restrictions by 21 June 2021, in addition to three alternative hypothetical relaxation strategies. Rates of public mobility within the local area were shown to account for 77% and 65% of the variance in non-COVID-19 related A&E attendances and emergency admissions respectively. Modelling supports an increase in emergency demand in line with the level and timing of societal restrictions, with significant increases to be expected upon the ending of all legal limits. This study finds that non-COVID-19 emergency demand associates with the level of societal restrictions, with rates of public mobility representing a key determinant. Through predictive modelling, healthcare systems can improve their demand forecasting in effectively managing hospital capacity.	Prevention
34343550	Exploring the effects of PM2.5 and temperature on COVID-19 transmission in Seoul, South Korea. With a recent surge of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2, COVID-19) in South Korea, this study attempts to investigate the effects of environmental conditions such as air pollutants (PM2.5) and meteorological covariate (Temperature) on COVID-19 transmission in Seoul. To account for unobserved heterogeneity in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 across 25 contiguous districts within Seoul, we adopt a full Bayesian hierarchical approach for the generalized linear mixed models. A formal statistical analysis suggests that there exists a positive correlation between a 7-day lagged effect of PM2.5 concentration and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which implies an elevated risk of the infectious disease. Conversely, temperature has shown a negative correlation with the number of COVID-19 cases, leading to reduction in relative risks. In addition, we clarify that the random fluctuation in the relative risks of COVID-19 mainly originates from temporal aspects, whereas no significant evidence of variability in relative risks is observed in terms of spatial alignment of the 25 districts. Nevertheless, this study provides empirical evidence using model-based formal assessments regarding COVID-19 infection risks in 25 districts of Seoul from a different perspective.

34223349	A review of ECMO for cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest is an important public health concern, affecting an estimated 356,500 people in the out-of-hospital setting and 209,000 people in the in-hospital setting each year. The causes of cardiac arrest include acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, dyskalemia, respiratory failure, hypovolemia, sepsis, and poisoning among many others. In order to tackle the enormous issue of high mortality among sufferers of cardiac arrest, ongoing research has been seeking improved treatment protocols and novel therapies. One of the mechanical devices that has been increasingly utilized for cardiac arrest is venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). Presently there is only one published randomized controlled trial examining the use of VA-ECMO as part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), a process referred to as extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). Recently there has been significant progress in providing ECPR for refractory cardiac arrest patients. This narrative review seeks to outline the use of ECPR for both in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, as well as provide information on the expected outcomes associated with its use.

34347294	Prevalence and correlates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the general public in Iraqi Kurdistan: A cross-sectional study. Low vaccine acceptance is a major barrier to vaccination coverage in every health system. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and associated factors of the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a sample of the general population in Iraqi Kurdistan. The general population with both genders with different educational levels and sociodemographic characteristics from the Duhok governorate was eligible to participate in this cross-sectional study in 2021. Therefore, an online Google form was sent to main pages and social groups through two main social media platforms. To obtain a representative sample of individuals with different educational levels, the author visited the main shopping center in Duhok city to collect the information from illiterate and low-level education individuals. The study found that 83.5% (n = 773) of the participants have not received and 51.4% (n = 476) did not intend to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. A small percentage has not decided to receive a COVID-19 vaccine yet (n = 17, 1.8%). The intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was increased with increasing level of education; 25.9%, 26.7%, 39.8%, and 53.6% in illiterate, under high school, high school, and college and higher, respectively (p < 0.0001). Healthcare workers were more likely to intend to receive a COVID-19, 57.5% vs 40.1%, p < 0.0001. Individuals who had concerns about the side effects of a COVID-19 vaccine were more likely to not receive and not intend to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was high in this region and was correlated with lower education and concerns about side effects.	Treatment
34287207	Health Care Professionals' Experiences With the Use of Video Consultation: Qualitative Study. BACKGROUND: The number of remote video consultations between doctors and patients has increased during the last few years and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The health care service is faced with rising rates of chronic illness and many patients who are more confident in self-management of their illnesses. In addition, there is an improved long-term outlook for serious conditions, such as cancer, that might require flexibility in everyday life. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how medical doctors in the outpatient clinic use and experience the use of video consultations with hematological patients, with a focus on relational and organizational aspects. METHODS: The study was designed as an explorative and qualitative study. Data were collected via participant observations and focus group interviews with medical doctors. RESULTS: The study identified possibilities and barriers in relation to adapting to the alternative way of meeting patients in the clinical setting. One of the main findings in this study is that the medical doctors were afraid that they missed important observations, as they were not able to perform a physical examination, if needed. They also emphasized that handshake and eye contact were important in order to get an overall impression of the patient's situation. It also became clear that the medical doctors used body language a lot more during video consultation compared with consultation in a physical setting. The medical doctors found the contact with the patients via the screen to be good, and the fact that the technology was working well made them feel comfortable with the video consultation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that the medical doctors were able to maintain good contact with the patients despite the screen and were able to assess the patients in a satisfying manner. However, there were still uncertainties among some doctors about the fact that they could not examine the patients physically. New knowledge about how to use gestures and body language during video consultation was obtained.	Prevention
34208884	Serological Response in Lung Transplant Recipients after Two Doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccines. BACKGROUND: Lung-transplant (LT) recipients are at high risk for COVID-19 due to immunosuppression and respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2. The information on the effect of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to elicit immunogenic responses after a two-dose (2D) regimen in LT recipients is sparse. Thus, we assessed the effect of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines' 2D regimen on anti-spike responses in immunocompromised LT recipients. METHODS: We utilized serum samples from LT recipients vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 with 2D of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines and 2D-vaccinated naive (non-transplanted and non-exposed to COVID-19) group. Antibody responses were assessed using the FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG assay (IgGNC), the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein IgM assay (IgMSP), and the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein IgG II assay (IgGSP). CD4+ T-cell activity was assessed as a marker of immune competence using the ImmuKnow((R)) assay. RESULTS: About 25% (18/73) of SARS-CoV-2 uninfected-LT patients generated a positive spike-IgG response following 2D of vaccines, with 36% (9/25) in the Moderna cohort and only 19% (9/48) in the Pfizer cohort. 2D in LT patients elicited a significantly lesser median IgGSP response (1.7 AU/mL, 95% CI: 0.6-7.5 AU/mL) compared to non-transplanted, uninfected naive subjects (14,209 AU/mL, 95% CI: 11,261-18,836 AU/mL; p < 0.0001). In LT patients, the Moderna-evoked seropositivity trend was higher than Pfizer. CONCLUSION: 2D COVID-19 vaccination elicits a dampened serological response in LT patients. Whether assessing other arms of host immunity combined with a higher vaccine dose can better capture and elicit improved immunogenicity in this immunocompromised population warrants investigation.

34282210	Targeted metabolomics identifies high performing diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19. Research exploring the development and outcome of COVID-19 infections has led to the need to find better diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. This cross-sectional study used targeted metabolomics to identify potential COVID-19 biomarkers that predicted the course of the illness by assessing 110 endogenous plasma metabolites from individuals admitted to a local hospital for diagnosis/treatment. Patients were classified into four groups ( approximately 40 each) according to standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 testing and disease course: PCR-/controls (i.e., non-COVID controls), PCR+/not-hospitalized, PCR+/hospitalized, and PCR+/intubated. Blood samples were collected within 2 days of admission/PCR testing. Metabolite concentration data, demographic data and clinical data were used to propose biomarkers and develop optimal regression models for the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC; 95% CI) was used to assess each models' predictive value. A panel that included the kynurenine: tryptophan ratio, lysoPC a C26:0, and pyruvic acid discriminated non-COVID controls from PCR+/not-hospitalized (AUC = 0.947; 95% CI 0.931-0.962). A second panel consisting of C10:2, butyric acid, and pyruvic acid distinguished PCR+/not-hospitalized from PCR+/hospitalized and PCR+/intubated (AUC = 0.975; 95% CI 0.968-0.983). Only lysoPC a C28:0 differentiated PCR+/hospitalized from PCR+/intubated patients (AUC = 0.770; 95% CI 0.736-0.803). If additional studies with targeted metabolomics confirm the diagnostic value of these plasma biomarkers, such panels could eventually be of clinical use in medical practice.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34210736	COVID-19 international border surveillance at Toronto's Pearson Airport: a cohort study. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to estimate the positivity rate of air travellers coming to Toronto, Canada in September and October 2020, on arrival and on day 7 and day 14. The secondary objectives were to estimate the degree of risk based on country of origin and to assess knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 control measures and subjective well-being during the quarantine period. DESIGN: Prospective cohort of arriving international travellers. SETTING: Toronto Pearson Airport Terminal 1, Toronto, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Participants of this study were passengers arriving on international flights. Inclusion criteria were those aged 18 or older who had a final destination within 100 km of the airport, spoke English or French, and provided consent. Excluded were those taking a connecting flight, had no internet access, exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival or were exempted from quarantine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus on reverse transcription PCR with self-administered oral-nasal swab and general well-being using the WHO-5 Well-being Index. RESULTS: Of 16 361 passengers enrolled, 248 (1.5%, 95% CI 1.3% to 1.7%) tested positive. Of these, 167 (67%) were identified on arrival, 67 (27%) on day 7, and 14 (6%) on day 14. The positivity rate increased from 1% in September to 2% in October. Average well-being score declined from 19.8 (out of a maximum of 25) to 15.5 between arrival and day 7 (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A single arrival test will pick up two-thirds of individuals who will become positive by day 14, with most of the rest detected on the second test on day 7. These results support strategies identified through mathematical models that a reduced quarantine combined with testing can be as effective as a 14-day quarantine.	Prevention
34289779	Recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus AdC7 expressing dimeric tandem-repeat spike protein RBD protects mice against COVID-19. AbstractA safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed to control the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Four adenovirus vectored vaccines expressing spike (S) protein have been approved for use. Here, we generated several recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (AdC7) vaccines expressing S, receptor-binding domain (RBD) or tandem-repeat dimeric RBD (RBD-tr2). We found vaccination via either intramuscular or intranasal route was highly immunogenic in mice to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. AdC7-RBD-tr2 showed higher antibody responses compared to either AdC7-S or AdC7-RBD. Intranasal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 additionally induced mucosal immunity with neutralizing activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Either single-dose or two-dose mucosal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 protected mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with undetectable subgenomic RNA in lung and relieved lung injury. AdC7-RBD-tr2-elicted sera preserved the neutralizing activity against the circulating variants, especially the Delta variant. These results support AdC7-RBD-tr2 as a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate.	Mechanism;Treatment
34207878	Effect of COVID-19 on Thoracic Oncology Surgery in Spain: A Spanish Thoracic Surgery Society (SECT) Survey. After the first wave of COVID-19, the Spanish Society of Thoracic Surgeons (SECT) surveyed its members to assess the impact of the pandemic on thoracic oncology surgery in Spain. In May 2020, all SECT members were invited to complete an online, 40-item, multiple choice questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed by the SECT Scientific Committee and sent via email. The overall response rate was 19.2%. The respondents answered at least 91.5% of the items, with only one exception (a question about residents). Most respondents (89.3%) worked in public hospitals. The reported impact of the pandemic on routine clinical activity was considered extreme or severe by 75.5% of respondents (25.5% and 50%, respectively). Multidisciplinary tumour boards were held either with fewer members attending or through electronic platforms (44.6% and 35.9%, respectively). Surgical activity decreased by 95.7%, with 41.5% of centers performing surgery only on oncological patients and 11.7% only in emergencies. Nearly 60% of respondents reported modifying standard protocols for early-stage cancer and in the preoperative workup. Most centers ( approximately 80%) reported using full personal protective equipment when operating on COVID-19 positive patients. The COVID-19 pandemic severely affected thoracic oncology surgery in Spain. The lack of common protocols led to a variable care delivery to lung cancer patients.	Prevention
34226483	Mucormycosis, The Deadly New Worry to COVID-19 Pandemic. Recently, mucormycosis, extremely rare fungal infections are emerging as a matter of concern in COVID-19. The saprophytic fungi of Mucorales species cause the disease, Mucormycosis, only in immunocompromised hosts. Clinical presentation of mucormycosis is related to the underlying conditions; rhino-cerebral disease is the most common form, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus; pulmonary, cutaneous, or gastrointestinal infections can also occur. Severe COVID-19 itself is a life-threatening disease and various factors, including diabetes, especially when complicated by ketoacidosis, previous respiratory pathology, immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial infection sources and systemic immune alterations of COVID-19 itself predispose to mucormycosis. No specific biomarkers are available to diagnose mucormycosis; imaging of the involved area and histopathological examination of the biopsied tissue are most important in diagnosis. The underlying medical conditions must be corrected; these include good glycemic control, tapering of steroids, and reducing or stopping immunosuppressive medications. Systemic antifungal therapy with liposomal Amphotericin B is the medical treatment of choice though drug resistance is not uncommon. Surgical debridement of devitalized tissue is often required. Severe COVID-19 patients with secondary co-infections require longer hospitalization and had higher risks of death. The mortality rate is almost 50% despite timely adequate treatment. The judicious use of systemic glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents for treating severe disease and hyperglycemia control seems vital for preventing and managing mucormycosis.

34212511	"COVID-19 Vaccines are Effective in People with Obesity: A Position Statement from The Obesity Society. The position statement is issued by The Obesity Society in response to published literature, as well as inquiries made to the Society by patients, providers, society members, policy makers, and others regarding the efficacy of vaccines in persons with obesity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which causes Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19). The Obesity Society has critically evaluated data from published peer-reviewed literature and briefing documents from Emergency Use Authorization applications submitted by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. We conclude that these vaccines are highly efficacious, and their efficacy is not significantly different in people with and without obesity, based on scientific evidence available at the time of publication. The Obesity Society believes there is no definitive way to determine which of these three COVID-19 vaccines is ""best"" for any weight subpopulation (due to differences in the trial design and outcome measures in the phase 3 trials, elapsed time between doses, and regional differences in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants [e.g. South Africa B.1.351 in Johnson and Johnson trial]). All three trials have demonstrated high efficacy against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death. Therefore, The Obesity Society encourages adults with obesity >/=18 years (>/=16 years for Pfizer-BioNTech) to undergo vaccination with any one of the currently available vaccines authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as soon as they are able."

34345656	"Virtual mask fitting in pediatric patients during COVID-19: A case series. Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented threat to our health care system. Clinicians had to pivot and develop creative and timely ""virtual"" solutions to provide clinical care. Our aim was to develop a standardized approach to virtual ""mask fitting"" for children who are either being initiated or are already on existing long-term ventilation (LTV) at a pediatric hospital. Case and outcomes: We present three cases involving the care of children who required mask fitting for noninvasive ventilation (NIV). LTV team consultations were delivered via videoconference or phone. With the guidance of the respiratory therapist (RT), the family caregiver (FC) took measurements on their child using a standardized clinical approach (developed by the LTV RTs). Based on the measurements, an appropriate mask was selected. Successful mask fit was based on patient/FC reports, as well as objective leak data obtained from the NIV download data. Discussion: Virtual clinics used for managing patients in our LTV program were feasible and efficient resulting in improved workflow for the RTs and convenience for patients and FCs. Patients and FCs had significantly less pressure to attend in-person clinics and expressed high satisfaction in terms of their experience and importantly, meeting respiratory care needs. Within the context of COVID-19, remote patient education and intervention can be delivered effectively, while reducing the risk of exposure from in-person visits to hospital. Conclusion: A virtual/telemedicine program to manage pediatric patients requiring mask fitting for LTV was a feasible option during COVID-19."	Prevention
34212739	Opinion and uptake of chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 during the mandatory lockdown in the sub-Saharan African region. BACKGROUND: As the search for effective treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection continues, the public opinion around the potential use of chloroquine (CQ) in treating COVID-19 remains mixed. AIM: To examine opinion and uptake of CQ for treating COVID-19 in the sub-Saharan African (SSA) region. SETTING: This study was conducted through an online survey software titled SurveyMonkey. METHODS: Anonymous online survey of 1829 SSA countries was conducted during the lockdown period using Facebook, WhatsApp and authors' networks. Opinion and uptake of CQ for COVID-19 treatment were assessed using multivariate analyses. RESULTS: About 14% of respondents believed that CQ could treat COVID-19 and of which, 3.2% took CQ for COVID-19 treatment. Multivariate analyses revealed that respondents from Central (adjusted odds ratios [aOR]: 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43, 4.43) and West Africa (aOR: 1.79, 95% CI 1.15, 2.88) had higher odds of believing that CQ could treat COVID-19. Respondents from East Africa reported higher odds for uptake of CQ for COVID-19 than Central, Western and Southern Africans. Knowledge of the disease and compliance with the public health advice were associated with both belief and uptake of CQ for COVID-19 treatment. CONCLUSION: Central and West African respondents were more likely to believe in CQ as a treatment for COVID-19 whilst the uptake of the medication during the pandemic was higher amongst East Africans. Future intervention discouraging the unsupervised use of CQ should target respondents from Central, West and East African regions.	Treatment
34291834	Low Phase angle is associated with 60-day mortality in COVID-19 Critically ill-patients. BACKGROUND: Malnutrition status, body composition indicators and bioimpedance (BIA) parameters have been associated with increased risk of death in several pathologies. The aim of this study was to describe the associations between phase angle (PhA) indicators obtained by BIA with length of hospital stay, days on mechanical ventilation and 60-day mortality in critically ill patients infected with SARS-COV-2. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. We assessed nutritional risk and body composition with BIA within 48 hours from ICU admission. Logistic and linear regression models were used to analyze the association between variables and clinical outcomes. Survival analysis by PhA value was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were included. PhA (OR 0.36, p = 0.002), SPA (OR 0.45, p = 0.001) and extracellular water/total body water ratio (OR 3.25, p = 0.002) were significant predictors of 60-day mortality. PhA <3.85 degrees in females and <5.25 degrees in males showed good (AUC 0.83, p = 0.03) and fair (AUC 0.74, p = 0.003) discrimination, respectively, for mortality prediction. Using cut-off values, low PhA was associated with a significantly increased risk of 60-day mortality (HR 3.08, 95%CI 1.12-8.41, p = 0.02). No association was detected for SPA. CONCLUSION: Low PhA values could be a predictor of 60-day mortality in COVID-19 critically ill patients. This biological marker could be incorporated as a part of nutritional and mortality risk assessment in this population. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

34218165	Evaluation of PCR cycle threshold values by patient population with the quidel lyra SARS-CoV-2 assay. The Lyra SARS-CoV-2 assay was the primary method for molecular testing performed at Barnes-Jewish Healthcare System in St. Louis, Missouri during the initial COVID-19 surge from mid-March to late-April 2020. We performed a retrospective analysis of 1,043 positive Lyra SARS-CoV-2 results during these 36 days to investigate associations between cycle threshold (CT) value and patient characteristics. Total RNA were extracted from NP or OP swabs using either the EasyMag or KingFisher automated extraction systems and quantified with RotorGene Q (Qiagen) or Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx thermocyclers respectively. Notably, we found lower a significant median lower CT for samples tested on the KingFisher-ABI 7500 fastDX (KF/ABI) system compared to the EasyMag/RotorGene (EM/RGQ) platform. Since 77.5% of our tests were ran on the EM/RGQ pipeline we then perform additional analysis on these values and found that C T values in outpatient care settings compared to samples obtained in the emergency department or inpatient had significantly lower C T values. These collective findings suggests a difference in viral load amongst various patient populations.	Diagnosis
34357032	Analytical Performance of COVID-19 Detection Methods (RT-PCR): Scientific and Societal Concerns. Background. Health and social management of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, responsible for the COVID-19 disease, requires both screening tools and diagnostic procedures. Reliable screening tests aim at identifying (truely) infectious individuals that can spread the viral infection and therefore are essential for tracing and harnessing the epidemic diffusion. Instead, diagnostic tests should supplement clinical and radiological findings, thus helping in establishing the diagnosis. Several analytical assays, mostly using RT-PCR-based technologies, have become commercially available for healthcare workers and clinical laboratories. However, such tests showed some critical limitations, given that a relevant number of both false-positive and false-negative cases have been so far reported. Moreover, those analytical techniques demonstrated to be significantly influenced by pre-analytical biases, while the sensitivity showed a dramatic time dependency. Aim. Herein, we critically investigate limits and perspectives of currently available RT-PCR techniques, especially when referring to the required performances in providing reliable epidemiological and clinical information. Key Concepts. Current data cast doubt on the use of RT-PCR swabs as a screening procedure for tracing the evolution of the current SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Indeed, the huge number of both false-positive and false-negative results deprives the trustworthiness of decision making based on those data. Therefore, we should refine current available analytical tests to quickly identify individuals able to really transmit the virus, with the aim to control and prevent large outbreaks.	Diagnosis
34282376	Immunosuppression minimization in kidney transplant recipients hospitalized for COVID-19. Background: Immunosuppressed patients such as kidney transplant recipients (KTs) have increased mortality risk in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The role and management of chronic immunosuppressive therapies during COVID-19 must be characterized. Methods: Herein, we report the follow-up of a cohort of 47 KTs admitted at two Spanish Kidney Transplant Units, who survived COVID-19. The impact of the management of immunosuppression during COVID-19 on graft function and immunologic events was evaluated. Results: At least one immunosuppressive agent was withdrawn in 83% of patients, with antimetabolites being the most frequent. Steroids were generally not stopped and the dose was even increased in 15% of patients as part of the treatment of COVID-19. Although immunosuppressive drugs were suspended during a median time of 17 days, no rejection episodes or de novo donor-specific antibodies were observed up to 3 months after discharge, and no significant changes occurred in calculated panel reactive antibodies. Acute graft dysfunction was common (55%) and the severity was related to tacrolimus trough levels, which were higher in patients receiving antivirals. At the end of follow-up, all patients recovered baseline kidney function. Conclusions: Our observational study suggests that immunosuppression in KTs hospitalized due to COVID-19 could be safely minimized.	Treatment
34209719	New Onset of Hepatic Steatosis Post-Severe Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C): A Case Report. The emergence of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) following SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents provided a new diagnostic and management challenge as there is limited knowledge about this condition and its natural history. In existing literature on MIS-C, there are currently no data about long-term outcomes. We report the case of a 14-year-old boy, with no significant past medical history, who presented a condition of multiorgan dysfunction due to MIS-C, after a SARS CoV-2 infection, and subsequent clinical-laboratory signs of hepatic steatosis at short-term follow-up. The case suggests how hepatic steatosis may be a possible sequela following SARS-CoV-2 infection, MIS-C and its medical treatment. Therefore, a close and long-term follow-up is needed to establish the pathophysiology and the evolution of this condition in patients following MIS-C.	Case Report
34205893	SARS-Cov-2 Natural Infection in a Symptomatic Cat: Diagnostic, Clinical and Medical Management in a One Health Vision. Despite the reported increase in SARS-CoV-2-infected pets, the description of the clinical features from natural infection and the medical follow up in symptomatic pets is still not sufficiently documented. This study reports the case of an indoor cat that displayed respiratory signs and a gastrointestinal syndrome, following the COVID-19 diagnosis of his owners. Thoracic radiographies were suggestive of bronchial pneumonia, while blood tests were indicative of a mild inflammatory process. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive through RT-qPCR assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 genes 14 days after his owners tested positive for the virus. Nasal swabs persisted to be RT-qPCR positive after 31 days. Serology confirmed the presence of antibodies through ELISA, electrochemiluminescence analysis and plaque reduction neutralization test, recording a high antibody titre after 31 days. The cat improved after medical treatment and clinically recovered. This study suggests that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 could lead to a natural infection with bronchial pneumonia in cats along with a possible prolonged persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper airways, albeit at a low level. The cat developed neutralizing antibodies, reaching a high titre after 31 days. Further descriptions of SARS-CoV-2 naturally infected pets, their medical management and diagnostic findings would be useful to enhance knowledge about COVID-19 in susceptible animals.	Case Report
34217634	The epidemiology and etiologies of respiratory tract infection in Northern Taiwan during the early phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests symptoms as common etiologies of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). During the pandemic of COVID-19, identifying the etiologies correctly from patients with RTI symptoms was crucial in not only disease control but preventing healthcare system from collapsing. By applying sensitive PCR-based molecular assays, we detected the etiologic agents and delineated the epidemiologic picture of RTIs in the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From December 2019 to February 2020, we screened patients presented with RTIs using multiplex PCR-based diagnostic assays. Data from pediatric and adult patients were compared with different months and units in the hospital. RESULTS: Of all 1631 patients including 1445 adult and 186 pediatric patients screened, 8 viruses and 4 bacteria were identified. Positive rates were 25% in December, 37% in January, and 20% in February, with pediatric patients having higher positive rates than adults (Ps < 0.001). In pediatric patients, RhV/EnV was the most commonly detected, followed by parainfluenza viruses. Most Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection occurred in pediatric patients. RhV/EnV was the most commonly detected agent in pediatric patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), while influenza accounted for the majority of adult cases with critical illness. Noticeably, seasonal coronavirus ranked second in both adult and pediatric patients with ICU admission. CONCLUSION: While we focused on the pandemic of COVID-19, common etiologies still accounted for the majority of RTIs and lead to severe diseases, including other seasonal coronaviruses.	Diagnosis
34202697	Vitamin A Plasma Levels in COVID-19 Patients: A Prospective Multicenter Study and Hypothesis. COVID-19 is a pandemic disease that causes severe pulmonary damage and hyperinflammation. Vitamin A is a crucial factor in the development of immune functions and is known to be reduced in cases of acute inflammation. This prospective, multicenter observational cross-sectional study analyzed vitamin A plasma levels in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and 40 hospitalized patients were included. Of these, 22 developed critical disease (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome [ARDS]/Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]), 9 developed severe disease (oxygen supplementation), and 9 developed moderate disease (no oxygen supplementation). A total of 47 age-matched convalescent persons that had been earlier infected with SARS-CoV-2 were included as the control group. Vitamin A plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Reduced vitamin A plasma levels correlated significantly with increased levels of inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin) and with markers of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (reduced lymphocyte count, LDH). Vitamin A levels were significantly lower in hospitalized patients than in convalescent persons (p < 0.01). Of the hospitalized patients, those who were critically ill showed significantly lower vitamin A levels than those who were moderately ill (p < 0.05). Vitamin A plasma levels below 0.2 mg/L were significantly associated with the development of ARDS (OR = 5.54 [1.01-30.26]; p = 0.048) and mortality (OR 5.21 [1.06-25.5], p = 0.042). Taken together, we conclude that vitamin A plasma levels in COVID-19 patients are reduced during acute inflammation and that severely reduced plasma levels of vitamin A are significantly associated with ARDS and mortality.

34210573	Evidence for antibody as a protective correlate for COVID-19 vaccines. A correlate of protection (CoP) is urgently needed to expedite development of additional COVID-19 vaccines to meet unprecedented global demand. To assess whether antibody titers may reasonably predict efficacy and serve as the basis of a CoP, we evaluated the relationship between efficacy and in vitro neutralizing and binding antibodies of 7 vaccines for which sufficient data have been generated. Once calibrated to titers of human convalescent sera reported in each study, a robust correlation was seen between neutralizing titer and efficacy (rho = 0.79) and binding antibody titer and efficacy (rho = 0.93), despite geographically diverse study populations subject to different forces of infection and circulating variants, and use of different endpoints, assays, convalescent sera panels and manufacturing platforms. Together with evidence from natural history studies and animal models, these results support the use of post-immunization antibody titers as the basis for establishing a correlate of protection for COVID-19 vaccines.

34367423	Social media and management of COVID-19 in a developing country: the case of Cameroon. Since the first reported case of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan China, the virus has spread to every continent, including sub-Saharan Africa. There exist no cure or vaccine for COVID-19. Classic public health approaches such as hygiene and sanitation, and social distancing are the recommended measures to contain the spread of the causative virus. While it is possible to combine strict lockdown measures in some western countries, this is not practical in almost every country in sub-Saharan Africa. In Cameroon, those without symptoms are encouraged to respect measures of hygiene and sanitation, physical distancing, and to wear a mask in public places. Those who develop symptoms are isolated in accredited COVID-19 management centres until they recover. However, the latter strategy is ineffective in containing the local spread of the virus because testing is not robust. Intuitively, the control of the virus in Cameroon depends largely on how engaged the public is in fighting against the virus. Social media can complement the use of community health workers for community or public engagement. In this viewpoint, we discuss how to optimize public engagement, to combat misinformation and to develop a culture for preparedness amidst the COVID-19 pandemic when time and resources are of the essence.

34198578	Dietary Intake and Supplement Use Among Saudi Residents during COVID-19 Lockdown. Healthy diet and supplement use may prove as sustainable strategies to lower COVID-19 infection. Our study investigated the dietary changes before and during lockdown and observed dietary supplements (DS) use among residents in Saudi Arabia. This cross-sectional study collected data via an online electronic survey questionnaire among males (N = 921) and females (N = 1044) residing in Saudi Arabia, 15 years of age and above. There was a significant decrease in the prevalence of males (before vs. during lockdown) having improved changes in dietary habit (68.6% vs. 65.8%; p = 0.004), which was similar in female participants (69 vs. 73.4% vs. 69%; p < 0.001). The frequency of multivitamin users among COVID-19 participants was significantly lower than non-users (44.4 vs. 55.6; p < 0.003). Male respondents within 26-35 years of age were more likely to use multivitamin supplements than females (30.1 vs. 22.6%; p < 0.05) of same age group. Predictors for DS use were increased age group, income, education level and COVID-19 status. In conclusion, an increase in unhealthy diet behavior was observed among Saudi males and females during the pandemic lockdown and the predictors of DS use included increased age, income, education level and COVID-19 status.

34198575	Role of Chest Imaging in Viral Lung Diseases. The infection caused by novel beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. However, in the last 20 years, this has not been the only viral infection to cause respiratory tract infections leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide, referring in particular to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza H1N1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Although in this pandemic period SARS-CoV-2 infection should be the first diagnosis to exclude, many other viruses can cause pulmonary manifestations and have to be recognized. Through the description of the main radiological patterns, radiologists can suggest the diagnosis of viral pneumonia, also combining information from clinical and laboratory data.	Diagnosis
34210996	Concurrent mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike protein emerged as the epidemiologically most successful SARS-CoV-2 variant. The D614G mutation in the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 has effectively replaced the early pandemic-causing variant. Using pseudotyped lentivectors, we confirmed that the aspartate replacement by glycine in position 614 is markedly more infectious. Molecular modelling suggests that the G614 mutation facilitates transition towards an open state of the Spike protein. To explain the epidemiological success of D614G, we analysed the evolution of 27,086 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from GISAID. We observed striking coevolution of D614G with the P323L mutation in the viral polymerase. Importantly, the exclusive presence of G614 or L323 did not become epidemiologically relevant. In contrast, the combination of the two mutations gave rise to a viral G/L variant that has all but replaced the initial D/P variant. Our results suggest that the P323L mutation, located in the interface domain of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is a necessary alteration that led to the epidemiological success of the present variant of SARS-CoV-2. However, we did not observe a significant correlation between reported COVID-19 mortality in different countries and the prevalence of the Wuhan versus G/L variant. Nevertheless, when comparing the speed of emergence and the ultimate predominance in individual countries, it is clear that the G/L variant displays major epidemiological supremacy over the original variant.

34228437	Targeting Neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2: Emerging Trends in Drug and Antibody Delivery to Combat COVID-19. Because SARS-CoV-2 uses the nasal cavity as a major route of entry to the human body, nasal administration of drugs and antibodies directed against the virus can prove to be effective for not only pulmonary COVID-19 but also prevention of potential early neuroinvasion caused by this virus. With recent reports of the potential application of antibody-laden nasal spray for the treatment of COVID-19, proposed here is the use of drugs recently proven to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 to be administered via inhalation route using a modified transcribrial device reported previously for its use against Naegleria fowleri, to target SARS-CoV-2 in our fight against COVID-1.

34342550	Stopping the COVID-19 pandemic in dental offices: A review of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and cross-infection prevention. Due to the essential role of dentists in stopping the COVID-19 pandemic, the purpose of this review is to help dentists to detect any weaknesses in their disinfection and cross-contamination prevention protocols, and to triage dental treatments to meet the needs of patients during the pandemic. We used PRISMA to identify peer-reviewed publications which supplemented guidance from the center for disease control about infection control and guidelines for dentists. Dentists must triage dental treatments to meet the needs of patients during the pandemic. The ongoing pandemic has changed the practice of dentistry forever, the changes make it more cumbersome, time-consuming, and costly due to the possible pathways of transmission and mitigation steps needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Dental chairside rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. Until then, dentists need to screen patients for COVID-19 even though 75% of people with COVID-19 have no symptoms. Despite the widespread anxiety and fear of the devastating health effects of COVID-19, only 61% of dentists have implemented a change to their treatment protocols. As an urgent matter of public health, all dentists must identify the additional steps they can take to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The most effective steps to stop the pandemic in dental offices are to; vaccinate all dentists, staff, and patients; triage dental treatments for patients, separate vulnerable patients, separate COVID-19 patients, prevent cross-contamination, disinfect areas touched by patients, maintain social distancing, and change personal protective equipment between patients.

34202233	Cutaneous Manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 Infection-A Series of Cases from the Largest Infectious Diseases Hospital in Western Romania. (1) Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection, which appeared as an isolated epidemic outbreak in December 2019, proved to be so contagious that, within 3 months, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. For one year (pre-vaccination period), the virus acted unhindered and was highly contagious, with a predominantly respiratory-oriented aggression. Although this lung damage, responsible for the more than 3,090,025 deaths, has provided sufficient data to facilitate the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms, other observation data, which meet the quality of emerging clinical aspects, such as rashes, remain without well-defined etiopathogenic support or a well-contoured clinical framework. (2) Methods and Results: We followed the occurrence of cutaneous manifestations in patients hospitalized during the second and third outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the main clinics of infectious diseases of our county, Timis, and recorded laboratory investigations and clinical evolution for five suggestive cases. (3) Conclusions: The presented cases, added to many other present and future clinical observations, will allow for better knowledge and understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a requirement that has become a global priority for the entire medical and scientific community.

34211781	Novel coronavirus mitigation measures implemented by radiotherapy centres in low and middle-income countries: a systematic review. Background: The aim of the study was to identify strategies adopted by radiotherapy centres in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to mitigate the effects of COVID-19. Studies summarising COVID-19 mitigation strategies designed and implemented by radiotherapy centres in LMICs to avoid delays, deferrments and interruptions of radiotherapy services are lacking. Materials and methods: A systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guideline. Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for peer-reviewed articles that reported measures adopted by radiotherapy centres in LMICs to reduce the risk of COVID-19. Information on different strategies were extracted from the included studies and textual narrative synthesis was conducted. Results: Of 60 articles retrieved, eleven were included. Majority of the studies were conducted in China. Ten of the included studies employed a qualitative design. Four themes were identified: preparing and equipping staff; reinforcing infection prevention and control policies; strengthening coordination and communication; and maintaining physical distancing. Studies reported that radiotherapy centres had: formed COVID-19 response multidisciplinary team; maximised the use of telehealth; adjusted the layout of waiting areas; divided staff into teams; dedicated a room for isolating suspected cases; and adopted triage systems. Conclusions: Local adaptation of established global strategies coupled with timely development of guidelines, flexibility and innovation have allowed radiotherapy leaders to continue to deliver radiotherapy services to cancer patients in LMICs during the COVID-19 crisis. Robust data collection must be encouraged in LMICs to provide an evidence-based knowledge for use in the event of another pandemic.	Prevention
34346892	Social Media Monitoring of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Influenza Epidemic: Adapting for Informal Language in Arabic Twitter. BACKGROUND: Twitter is a real time messaging platform widely used by people and organisations to share information on many topics. It could potentially be useful to analyse tweets for infectious disease monitoring purposes in order to reduce reporting lag time, and to provide an independent complementary source of data, compared to traditional approaches. However, such analysis is currently not possible in the Arabic speaking world due to lack of basic building blocks for research and dialectal variation.. OBJECTIVE: We collect around 4,000 Arabic tweets related to COVID-19 and Influenza. We clean and label the tweets relative to the Arabic Infectious Diseases Ontology which includes non-standard terminology and 11 core concepts and 21 relations. The aim of this study is to analyse Arabic tweets to estimate their usefulness for health surveillance, understand the impact of the informal terms in the analysis, show the effect of the deep learning methods in the classification process, and identify the locations where the infection is spreading.. METHODS: We apply multi-label classification techniques: Binary Relevance, Classifier Chains, Label Powerset, Adapted Algorithm (MLKNN), NBSVM, BERT, and AraBERT to identify tweets appearing to be from infected individuals. We also use Named Entity Recognition to predict the place names mentioned in tweets. . RESULTS: We achieve an F1-score up to 88% in the Influenza case study and 94% in the COVID-19 one. Adapting for non-standard terminology and informal language helps to improve accuracy by as much as 15% with an average improvement of 8%. Deep learning methods achieve up to 94% on F1-score during the classifying process. Our geo-location detection algorithm can predict on average 54% accuracy for the location of the users using tweet content.. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies two Arabic social media datasets for monitoring tweets related to Influenza and COVID-19. It demonstrates the importance of including informal terms, which is regularly used by social media users, in the analysis. It also proves that BERT achieves good results when used with new terms in COVID-19 tweets. Finally, the tweet content may contain useful information to determine the location of the disease spread..

34222841	Graphene nanoplatelet and graphene oxide functionalization of face mask materials inhibits infectivity of trapped SARS-CoV-2. Recent advancements in bidimensional nanoparticles production such as graphene (G) and graphene oxide (GO) have the potential to meet the need for highly functional personal protective equipment (PPE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ability of G and GO to interact with microorganisms provides an opportunity to develop engineered textiles for use in PPE and limit the spread of COVID-19. PPE in current use in high-risk settings for COVID transmission provides only a physical barrier that decreases infection likelihood and does not inactivate the virus. Here, we show that virus pre-incubation with soluble GO inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of VERO cells. Furthermore, when G/GO-functionalized polyurethane or cotton was in contact SARS-CoV-2, the infectivity of the fabric was nearly completely inhibited. The findings presented here constitute an important innovative nanomaterial-based strategy to significantly increase PPE efficacy in protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that may implement water filtration, air purification, and diagnostics methods.

34289178	Growth assessment of children during the COVID-19 pandemic-Can we rely on parental measurements? AIM: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the rapid development of remote medical services. During lockdown periods, children's growth data were obtained from parents' home assessments. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of home height and weight measurements and analyse their utility in clinical decision-making. METHODS: A retrospective, single-centre observational study. Children aged 3-18 years were measured for weight and height at home using guidance provided to parents on proper measurements techniques before subsequent professional re-evaluation at our endocrine institution clinic. The two sets of measurements were compared and analysed according to various clinical parameters. RESULTS: Height measurements at home and in the clinic were comparable (diff = 0.1 +/- 1.3cm, p = 0.42) amongst the 107 children (mean age 10.2 +/- 3.7, 56.1% males) participating in the study, except in overweight and obese children where they were significantly higher in the clinic (diff = 0.86 +/- 1.48cm, p = 0.018). Weight and BMI were significantly higher in the clinic (diff = 0.45 +/- 0.8kg and diff = 0.3 +/- 0.6kg/m(2) , p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Height measurements of children by their parents were accurate except in obese and overweight children, whereas weight measurements tended to be lower than in the clinic. With proper guidance, parents' home measurements of height and weight are accurate and suitable for clinical decision-making.	Prevention
34219953	Deep convolution neural networks to differentiate between COVID-19 and other pulmonary abnormalities on chest radiographs: Evaluation using internal and external datasets. We aimed to evaluate the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the classification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease using normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 chest radiographs (CXRs). First, we collected 9194 CXRs from open datasets and 58 from the Korea University Anam Hospital (KUAH). The number of normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 CXRs were 4580, 3884, and 730, respectively. The CXRs obtained from the open dataset were randomly assigned to the training, tuning, and test sets in a 70:10:20 ratio. For external validation, the KUAH (20 normal, 20 pneumonia, and 18 COVID-19) dataset, verified by radiologists using computed tomography, was used. Subsequently, transfer learning was conducted using DenseNet169, InceptionResNetV2, and Xception to identify COVID-19 using open datasets (internal) and the KUAH dataset (external) with histogram matching. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping was used for the visualization of abnormal patterns in CXRs. The average AUC and accuracy of the multiscale and mixed-COVID-19Net using three CNNs over five folds were (0.99 +/- 0.01 and 92.94% +/- 0.45%), (0.99 +/- 0.01 and 93.12% +/- 0.23%), and (0.99 +/- 0.01 and 93.57% +/- 0.29%), respectively, using the open datasets (internal). Furthermore, these values were (0.75 and 74.14%), (0.72 and 68.97%), and (0.77 and 68.97%), respectively, for the best model among the fivefold cross-validation with the KUAH dataset (external) using domain adaptation. The various state-of-the-art models trained on open datasets show satisfactory performance for clinical interpretation. Furthermore, the domain adaptation for external datasets was found to be important for detecting COVID-19 as well as other diseases.	Diagnosis
34130948	Risk factors for transfer from Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit to Intensive Care Unit in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19-related pneumonia often need several degrees of ventilatory support, which are performed between Respiratory Intermediate Care Units (RICUs) and Intensive Care Units (ICUs), and which depend on the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is no firm consensus on transfer predictors from the RICU to the ICU. METHODS: In this retrospective observational single center study, we evaluated 96 COVID-19 patients referred to the RICU for acute respiratory failure (ARF) according to their transferal to the ICU or their stay at the RICU. We compared demographic data, baseline laboratory profile, and final clinical outcomes to identify early risk factors for transfer. RESULTS: The best predictors for transfer to the ICU were elevated C-reactive protein and lymphopenia. The mortality rate was lower in the RICU than in the ICU, where transferred patients who died were mostly younger men and with less comorbidities than those in the RICU. CONCLUSIONS: Few inflammatory markers can predict the need for transfer from the RICU to the ICU. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we urge better clinical stratification by early and meaningful profiles in patients admitted to the RICU who are at risk of transferal to the ICU.

34359931	Cytokine Storm Syndrome in SARS-CoV-2 Infections: A Functional Role of Mast Cells. Cytokine storm syndrome is a cascade of escalated immune responses disposing the immune system to exhaustion, which might ultimately result in organ failure and fatal respiratory distress. Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 can result in uncontrolled production of cytokines and eventually the development of cytokine storm syndrome. Mast cells may react to viruses in collaboration with other cells and lung autopsy findings from patients that died from the coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 (COVID-19) showed accumulation of mast cells in the lungs that was thought to be the cause of pulmonary edema, inflammation, and thrombosis. In this review, we present evidence that a cytokine response by mast cells may initiate inappropriate antiviral immune responses and cause the development of cytokine storm syndrome. We also explore the potential of mast cell activators as adjuvants for COVID-19 vaccines and discuss the medications that target the functions of mast cells and could be of value in the treatment of COVID-19. Recognition of the cytokine storm is crucial for proper treatment of patients and preventing the release of mast cell mediators, as impeding the impacts imposed by these mediators could reduce the severity of COVID-19.

34228637	Prognostic and immunological value of ATP6AP1 in breast cancer: implications for SARS-CoV-2. Abnormal ATPase H+ Transporting Accessory Protein 1 (ATP6AP1) expression may promote carcinogenesis. We investigated the association of ATP6AP1 with breast cancer (BC) and COVID-19. The Oncomine, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Human Protein Atlas and Kaplan-Meier plotter databases were used to evaluate the expression and prognostic value of ATP6AP1 in BC. ATP6AP1 was upregulated in BC tissues, and higher ATP6AP1 expression was associated with poorer outcomes. Data from the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource, Tumor-Immune System Interaction Database and Kaplan-Meier plotter indicated that ATP6AP1 expression correlated with immune infiltration, and that its prognostic effects in BC depended on tumor-infiltrating immune cell subtype levels. Multiple databases were used to evaluate the association of ATP6AP1 with clinicopathological factors, assess the mutation and methylation of ATP6AP1, and analyze gene co-expression and enrichment. The ATP6AP1 promoter was hypomethylated in BC tissues and differentially methylated between different disease stages and subtypes. Data from the Gene Expression Omnibus indicated that ATP6AP1 levels in certain cell types were reduced after SARS-CoV-2 infections. Ultimately, higher ATP6AP1 expression was associated with a poorer prognosis and with higher or lower infiltration of particular immune cells in BC. BC patients may be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections, which may alter their prognoses.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Treatment
34214650	Prescription Filling Patterns of Evidence-Based Medical Therapies for Heart Failure During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States. BACKGROUND: Maintaining a steady medication supply during a public health crisis is a major health priority. We leveraged a large U.S. pharmacy-claims database to understand the use of evidence-based therapies in heart failure (HF) care during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed 27,027,650 individual claims from an all-payer pharmacy-claims database across 56,155 chain, independent and mail-order pharmacies in 14,164 zip codes in 50 states. Prescriptions dispensed (in 2-week intervals) of evidence-based HF therapies in 2020 were indexed to comparable timeframes in 2019. We normalized these year-to-year changes in HF medical therapies relative to those observed with a stable basket of drugs. RESULTS: Fills of losartan, lisinopril, carvedilol, and metoprolol all peaked in the weeks of March 2020 and demonstrated trajectories thereafter that were relatively consistent with the reference set of drugs. Fills of spironolactone (+4%) and eplerenone (+18%) showed modest trends toward increased relative use during 2020. Fills of empagliflozin (+75%), dapagliflozin (+65%) and sacubitril/valsartan (+61%) showed striking longitudinal increases throughout 2020 that deviated substantially from year-to-year trends of the overall basket of drugs. For all 3 therapies, fills of all quantity sizes increased relatively throughout 2020. For both generic and brand-name therapies, prescription fill patterns from mail-order pharmacies increased substantially over expected trends beginning in March 2020 CONCLUSION: Prescription fills of most established generic therapies used in HF care were maintained, whereas those of sacubitril/valsartan and the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors steeply increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. These nationwide pharmacy claims data provide reassurance about therapeutic access, during a public health crisis, to evidence-based medications used in HF care.	Prevention
34290350	Development of rapid and cost-effective top-loading device for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies. Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the Betacoronavirus, caused a pandemic that affected the globe negatively. The gold method, RT-PCR, can detect SARS-CoV-2 but it is time-consuming and needs sophisticated equipment and professional personnel. On the other hand, rapid tests offer fast results and can detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Abs). The aim of this study is to develop a new rapid and cost-effective method for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Abs. A new top-loading detection device was developed and composed of a small piece of plastic (25 x 25 x 0.5 mm) with an opening in the center, a piece of nitrocellulose (NC) membrane enough to block the opening from one side and adhesive tape to affix the NC to the plastic piece. The NC is blotted with anti-human IgG/IgM and rabbit serum. The device was evaluated against a commercially available IgG/IgM ELISA detection kit using normal, Covid-19-positive, HCV, HBV, and Cytomegalovirus-positive sera. Outcomes demonstrated simplicity, reproducibility, and accuracy of the new device and results can be obtained in less than 5 min. We anticipate our developed assay method to be used widely in point of care before deciding on the use of expensive nucleic acid assays.	Diagnosis
34221930	Current and New Drugs for COVID-19 Treatment and Its Effects on the Liver. Corona virus disease (COVID)-19 is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (commonly referred to as SARS-CoV-2). In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Though the target organ for the virus is primarily the lungs, with the recent understanding of the pathobiology of this disease and the immune dysregulation associated with it, it is now clear that COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems. Several drugs and therapies have been tried or repurposed to combat the wrath posed by this disease. On October 22, 2020, the USA Food and Drug Administration approved remdesivir for use in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older). Several of the drugs being tried against COVID-19 have hepatotoxicity as their potential side effect. This review aims to provide the latest insights on various drugs being used in the treatment of COVID-19 and their effects on the liver.	Treatment
34224435	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and thyroid disease. An update. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with excess morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension and diabetes but little is known about thyroid diseases. Thus, our goal was to review the literature with respect to: (i) Are patients with underlying hypo- or hyperthyroidism at increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection? (ii) do underlying hypo- and hyperthyroidism impact the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection? (iii) does SARS-CoV-2 infection cause de novo thyroid dysfunction? RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with hypo- or hyperthyroidism do not have an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, and a diagnosis of hypo- or hyperthyroidism is not associated with a worsened prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with subsequent thyrotoxicosis, euthyroid sick syndrome, subacute thyroiditis, and autoimmune thyroid disease. SUMMARY: These findings suggest that receiving treatment for thyroid dysfunction does not per se impact the patients' risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, or the management of those who already contracted it. Additional studies with larger numbers of patients and long-term follow-up are required in order to clarify whether patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are more or less prone to develop thyroid dysfunction and/or thyroid autoimmunity than patients recovering from other virus infections.

34287058	Durable Antibody Responses in Staff at Two Long-Term Care Facilities, during and Post SARS-CoV-2 Outbreaks. SARS-CoV-2 has had a disproportionate impact on nonhospital health care settings, such as long-term-care facilities (LTCFs). The communal nature of these facilities, paired with the high-risk profile of residents, has resulted in thousands of infections and deaths and a high case fatality rate. To detect presymptomatic infections and identify infected workers, we performed weekly surveillance testing of staff at two LTCFs, which revealed a large outbreak at one of the sites. We collected serum from staff members throughout the study and evaluated it for binding and neutralization to measure seroprevalence, seroconversion, and type and functionality of antibodies. At the site with very few incident infections, we detected that over 40% of the staff had preexisting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, suggesting prior exposure. At the outbreak site, we saw rapid seroconversion following infection. Neutralizing antibody levels were stable for many weeks following infection, suggesting a durable, long-lived response. Receptor-binding domain antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were strongly correlated. The site with high seroprevalence among staff had two unique introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the facility through seronegative infected staff during the period of study, but these did not result in workplace spread or outbreaks. Together, our results suggest that a high seroprevalence rate among staff can contribute to immunity within a workplace and protect against subsequent infection and spread within a facility. IMPORTANCE Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 due to their communal nature and high-risk profile of residents. LTCF staff have the ability to introduce SARS-CoV-2 into the facility, where it can spread, causing outbreaks. We tested staff weekly at two LTCFs and collected blood throughout the study to measure SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. One site had a large outbreak and infected individuals rapidly generated antibodies after infection. At the other site, almost half the staff already had antibodies, suggesting prior infection. The majority of these antibodies bind to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and are potently neutralizing and stable for many months. The non-outbreak site had two unique introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the facility, but these did not result in workplace spread or outbreaks. Our results reveal that high seroprevalence among staff can contribute to immunity and protect against subsequent infection and spread within a facility.	Prevention
34199528	Aspergillus in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Scoping Review. Several reports have been published on Aspergillus findings in COVID-19 patients leading to a proposition of new disease entity COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis. This scoping review is designed at clarifying the concepts on how the findings of Aspergillus spp. in COVID-19 patients were interpreted. We searched Medline to identify the studies on Aspergillus spp. findings in COVID-19 patients. Included were observational studies containing the following information: explicit mention of the total number of the study population, study period, reason for obtaining respiratory samples, case definition, and clinical outcomes. Excluded were case series, case reports and reviews. Identified were 123 publications, and 8 observational studies were included. From the included studies the following issues were identified. The proportion of immunocompromised patients considered as host factors varied from 0 to 17%. Most of the studies did not mention radiographic findings explicitly. Respiratory samples were mostly obtained to investigate clinical deterioration. Aspergillus culture, antigen or PCR testing on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were performed in between 23.3% and 66.3% of the study population. Two studies performed periodic samples of BAL. Galactomannan index (GI) positivity in BAL was between 10% and 28%. GI in blood was found in 0.9% to 6.7% of the available samples. The prevalence of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis ranged from 2.7% to 27.7%. Studies compared the mortality between defined cases and non-cases, and all showed increased mortality in cases. No studies showed that antifungal treatment reduced mortality. Concluding, this review showed how studies defined the clinical entity COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis where positive Aspergillus test in the respiratory sample was the main driver for the diagnosis. There were many differences between studies in terms of test algorithm and Aspergillus test used that largely determined the prevalence. Whether antifungal therapy, either as prophylaxis, pre-emptive or targeted therapy will lead to better outcomes of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis patients is still need to be answered.

34333121	DimachkieSpectrum of Acute Neuropathy Associated with Covid-19: Clinical and electrophysiological study of 13 patients from a single center. OBJECTIVES: To analyze clinical and nerve conduction patterns in patients with acute neuropathy, preceded by or concomitantly having Covid-19 disease (Acute Neuropathy Associated with Covid-19 or ANAC 19). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical details, laboratory evaluation and electrophysiological parameters in patients with ANAC 19was done. This data was compared with non Covid GBS described in literature and also with patients of acute neuropathy without Covid 19 who had presented to our center during the period of study. RESULTS: Records of thirteen patients with ANAC 19were reviewed. Most patients clinically had paraparesis, and electrophysiologically showed demyelinating neuropathy. Peroneal and Sural nerves were the most frequently abnormal motor and sensory nerves respectively. A proportion of patients showed a peroneal velocity sparing pattern. Higher incidence of paraparesis and encephalopathy differentiated ANAC 19from non Covid GBS. CONCLUSIONS: ANAC 19has a comparable electrophysiological profile to non Covid GBS. However, it has a distinct clinical presentation.	Diagnosis

34204243	Investigation of Long COVID Prevalence and Its Relationship to Epstein-Barr Virus Reactivation. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients sometimes experience long-term symptoms following resolution of acute disease, including fatigue, brain fog, and rashes. Collectively these have become known as long COVID. Our aim was to first determine long COVID prevalence in 185 randomly surveyed COVID-19 patients and, subsequently, to determine if there was an association between occurrence of long COVID symptoms and reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in 68 COVID-19 patients recruited from those surveyed. We found the prevalence of long COVID symptoms to be 30.3% (56/185), which included 4 initially asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who later developed long COVID symptoms. Next, we found that 66.7% (20/30) of long COVID subjects versus 10% (2/20) of control subjects in our primary study group were positive for EBV reactivation based on positive titers for EBV early antigen-diffuse (EA-D) IgG or EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM. The difference was significant (p < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). A similar ratio was observed in a secondary group of 18 subjects 21-90 days after testing positive for COVID-19, indicating reactivation may occur soon after or concurrently with COVID-19 infection. These findings suggest that many long COVID symptoms may not be a direct result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus but may be the result of COVID-19 inflammation-induced EBV reactivation.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
34229327	Transient Changes in Preexposure Prophylaxis Use and Daily Sexual Behavior After the Implementation of COVID-19 Restrictions Among Men Who Have Sex With Men. BACKGROUND: We assessed how the Dutch restrictions imposed on March 15, 2020, affected sexual behavior, preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and condom use among PrEP users in Amsterdam. METHODS: We used data on (1) PrEP use, (2) anal sex acts, and (3) condom use, per partner type [steady partners (SPs), known casual partners (KCPs), and unknown casual partners (UCPs)], collected daily through a mobile application used between December 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020. We compared the period before versus after March 15, 2020, regarding average proportion of days per week at which each end point was reported and average proportion of anal sex acts covered by PrEP and/or condoms. RESULTS: We included data from 136 men who have sex with men. After March 15, 2020, the proportion of days with anal sex increased with SPs [odds ratio (OR) = 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10 to 1.44) and decreased with KCPs (OR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.82) and UCPs (OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.61). Shifts in partner types were most profound immediately after March 15, 2020, whereas returning to prerestriction levels mid-May 2020. The proportion of days with PrEP use decreased from 74% before to 58% after March 15, 2020 (P < 0.001). After March 15, 2020, PrEP use during sex decreased with UCPs (beta = -0.36; 95% CI = -0.72 to 0.00) but not with SPs and KCPs. Condom use during sex decreased with KCPs (beta = -0.36; 95% CI = -0.67 to 0.04) and UCPs (beta = -0.24; 95% CI = -0.46 to 0.03) but not with SPs. CONCLUSIONS: MSM decreased sex with casual partners and increased sex with SP, but changes were transient. Decreases in sex acts with casual partners paralleled decreases in PrEP use. However, condom use during sex with casual partners decreased, indicating the importance of continued sexual health services, including sexually transmitted infections screening and PrEP care, during COVID-19 restrictions.

34218807	Factors associated with the intention of Syrian adult population to accept COVID19 vaccination: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With global efforts to develop and deliver a COVID-19 vaccine rapidly, vaccine hesitancy stands as a barrier to these efforts. We aimed to estimate the proportion of Syrian adult population intending to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and, principally, to assess the demographic and attitudinal factors associated with it in order to approach suitable solutions. METHODS: An anonymous online questionnaire was conducted between 23rd December 2020 and 5th January 2021 in various provinces in Syria. A total of 3402 adults were sampled to reflect the population demographic factors. Attitudinal factors included Covid-19 fears, risks, and beliefs on the origin. Vaccination hesitancy and knowledge were also measured. The intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: According to their statements, 1222 participants (35.92%) will consent to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Our findings indicate that male gender, younger age, rural residence, not having children, smoking, fear about COVID-19, individual perceived severity, believing in the natural origin of the coronavirus, and high vaccination knowledge were positive predictors of embracing COVID-19 vaccine when it is available. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate is considerably poor across Syrian population compared to populations in developed countries. Vaccine hesitancy is closely bound to the fear of side effects and doubts about vaccine efficacy. Factors such as conspiracy beliefs and myths about the vaccine lower vaccine uptake. Thus, interventional educational campaigns are increasingly required to overcome misinformation and avert low vaccination acceptance rates.	Prevention
34212499	A systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients: Lessons to be learned. Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) may be at increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, due to prevalent comorbidities and immunosuppressed status. Given the global differences in COVID-19 policies and treatments, a robust assessment of all evidence is necessary to evaluate the clinical course of COVID-19 in KTR. Studies on mortality and acute kidney injury (AKI) in KTR in the World Health Organization COVID-19 database were systematically reviewed. We selected studies published between March 2020 and January 18th 2021, including at least five KTR with COVID-19. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to calculate overall proportions, including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Subgroup analyses were performed on time of submission, geographical region, sex, age, time after transplantation, comorbidities, and treatments. We included 74 studies with 5559 KTR with COVID-19 (64.0% males, mean age 58.2 years, mean 73 months after transplantation) in total. The risk of mortality, 23% (95% CI: 21%-27%), and AKI, 50% (95% CI: 44%-56%), is high among KTR with COVID-19, regardless of sex, age and comorbidities, underlining the call to accelerate vaccination programs for KTR. Given the suboptimal reporting across the identified studies, we urge researchers to consistently report anthropometrics, kidney function at baseline and discharge, (changes in) immunosuppressive therapy, AKI, and renal outcome among KTR.

34131980	A comprehensive review of the therapeutic potential of curcumin nanoformulations. Today, due to the prevalence of various diseases such as the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), diabetes, central nervous system diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and so on, extensive studies have been conducted on therapeutic properties of natural and synthetic agents. A literature review on herbal medicine and commercial products in the global market showed that curcumin (Cur) has many therapeutic benefits compared to other natural ingredients. Despite the unique properties of Cur, its use in clinical trials is very limited. The poor biopharmaceutical properties of Cur such as short half-life in plasma, low bioavailability, poor absorption, rapid metabolism, very low solubility (at acidic and physiological pH), and the chemical instability in body fluids are major concerns associated with the clinical applications of Cur. Recently, nanoformulations are emerging as approaches to develop and improve the therapeutic efficacy of various drugs. Many studies have shown that Cur nanoformulations have tremendous therapeutic potential against various diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, cancer, inflammatory, osteoporosis, and so on. These nanoformulations can inhibit many diseases through several cellular and molecular mechanisms. However, successful long-term clinical results are required to confirm their safety and clinical efficacy. The present review aims to update and explain the therapeutic potential of Cur nanoformulations.	Treatment;Mechanism
34200301	Characterization of Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2 and Other Human Pathogenic Coronaviruses Using a Multiplex Bead-Based Immunoassay. Serological assays that simultaneously detect antibodies to multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2 and to other structurally related coronaviruses provide a holistic picture of antibody response patterns. Well-validated multiplex immunoassays are scarce. Here, we evaluated the performance of an 11-plex serological assay capable of detecting antibodies directed to four antigenic targets of SARS-CoV-2 and to S1 proteins of other human pathogenic coronaviruses. We used 620 well-characterized sera (n = 458 seropositive and n = 110 seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-SARS-CoV-2 era and n = 52 seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 in the era of SARS-CoV-2) as positive and negative standards. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive values, including a 95% confidence interval. The difference in mean fluorescence intensity (95% CI) was used to assess a potential cross-reaction between antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the other coronaviruses. The sensitivity (95% CI) of detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to four antigenic targets ranged from 83.4% (76.7-86.7) to 93.7% (91.0-95.7) and the specificity from 98.2% (93.6-99.8) to 100% (96.7-100). We observed no obvious cross-reaction between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and antibodies to the other coronaviruses except for SARS-CoV-1. The high sensitivity and specificity warrant a reliable utilization of the assay in population-based seroprevalence surveys or vaccine efficacy studies.	Diagnosis
34215591	Protection of K18-hACE2 mice and ferrets against SARS-CoV-2 challenge by a single-dose mucosal immunization with a parainfluenza virus 5-based COVID-19 vaccine. Transmission-blocking vaccines are urgently needed to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV 2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. The upper respiratory tract is an initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection and, for many individuals, remains the primary site of virus replication. An ideal COVID-19 vaccine should reduce upper respiratory tract virus replication and block transmission as well as protect against severe disease. Here, we optimized a vaccine candidate, parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (CVXGA1), and then demonstrated that a single-dose intranasal immunization with CVXGA1 protects against lethal infection of K18-hACE2 mice, a severe disease model. CVXGA1 immunization also prevented virus infection of ferrets and blocked contact transmission. This mucosal vaccine strategy inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in the upper respiratory tract, thus preventing disease progression to the lower respiratory tract. A PIV5-based mucosal vaccine provides a strategy to induce protective innate and cellular immune responses and reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in populations.	Mechanism;Treatment
34356292	Role of Laboratory Medicine in SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostics. Lessons Learned from a Pandemic. Since the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, China, diagnostic methods in the field of molecular biology have been developing faster than ever under the vigilant eye of world's research community. Unfortunately, the medical community was not prepared for testing such large volumes or ranges of biological materials, whether blood samples for antibody immunological testing, or salivary/swab samples for real-time PCR. For this reason, many medical diagnostic laboratories have made the switch to working in the field of molecular biology, and research undertaken to speed up the flow of samples through laboratory. The aim of this narrative review is to evaluate the current literature on laboratory techniques for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection available on pubmed.gov, Google Scholar, and according to the writers' knowledge and experience of the laboratory medicine. It assesses the available information in the field of molecular biology by comparing real-time PCR, LAMP technique, RNA sequencing, and immunological diagnostics, and examines the newest techniques along with their limitations for use in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.

34201415	Do Changes in ACE-2 Expression Affect SARS-CoV-2 Virulence and Related Complications: A Closer Look into Membrane-Bound and Soluble Forms. The SARS-CoV-2 virus utilizes angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) for cell entry and infection. This enzyme has important functions in the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system to preserve cardiovascular function. In addition to the heart, it is expressed in many tissues including the lung, intestines, brain, and kidney, however, its functions in these organs are mostly unknown. ACE-2 has membrane-bound and soluble forms. Its expression levels are altered in disease states and by a variety of medications. Currently, it is not clear how altered ACE-2 levels influence ACE-2 virulence and relevant complications. In addition, membrane-bound and soluble forms are thought to have different effects. Most work on this topic in the literature is on the SARS-CoV virus that has a high genetic resemblance to SARS-Co-V-2 and also uses ACE-2 enzyme to enter the cell, but with much lower affinity. More recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 are mainly clinical studies aiming at relating the effect of medications that are thought to influence ACE-2 levels, with COVID-19 outcomes for patients under these medications. This review paper aims to summarize what is known about the relationship between ACE-2 levels and SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 virulence under altered ACE-2 expression states.	Mechanism;Treatment
34228254	Overcoming COVID-19 in China despite shortcomings of the public health system: what can we learn? BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Although there are some doubts about the reporting of cases and deaths in China, it seems that this country was able to control the epidemic more effectively than many other countries. In this paper, we would like to analyze the measures taken in China and compare them with other countries in order to find out what they can learn from China. METHODS: We develop a system dynamics model of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan. Based on a number of simulations we analyze the impact of changing parameters, such as contact rates, on the development of a second wave. RESULTS: Although China's health care system seems to be poorly financed and inefficient, the epidemic was brought under control in a comparably short period of time and no second wave was experienced in Wuhan until today. The measures to contain the epidemic do not differ from what was implemented in other countries, but China applied them very early and rigorously. For instance, the consequent implementation of health codes and contact-tracking technology contributed to contain the disease and effectively prevented the second and third waves. CONCLUSIONS: China's success in fighting COVID-19 is based on a very strict implementation of a set of measures, including digital management. While other countries discuss relaxing the lock-down at a rate of 50 per 100,000 inhabitants, China started local lock-downs at a rate of 3 per 100,000. We call for a public debate whether this policy would be feasible for more liberal countries as well.	Prevention
34342277	The beta-link motif in protein architecture. The beta-link is a composite protein motif consisting of a G1beta beta-bulge and a type II beta-turn, and is generally found at the end of two adjacent strands of antiparallel beta-sheet. The 1,2-positions of the beta-bulge are also the 3,4-positions of the beta-turn, with the result that the N-terminal portion of the polypeptide chain is orientated at right angles to the beta-sheet. Here, it is reported that the beta-link is frequently found in certain protein folds of the SCOPe structural classification at specific locations where it connects a beta-sheet to another area of a protein. It is found at locations where it connects one beta-sheet to another in the beta-sandwich and related structures, and in small (four-, five- or six-stranded) beta-barrels, where it connects two beta-strands through the polypeptide chain that crosses an open end of the barrel. It is not found in larger (eight-stranded or more) beta-barrels that are straightforward beta-meanders. In some cases it initiates a connection between a single beta-sheet and an alpha-helix. The beta-link also provides a framework for catalysis in serine proteases, where the catalytic serine is part of a conserved beta-link, and in cysteine proteases, including M(pro) of human SARS-CoV-2, in which two residues of the active site are located in a conserved beta-link.

34208887	Fatal COVID-19 in a Child with Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 Despite Extensive Multidisciplinary Treatment: A Case Report. Critical Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) developed in a 7-year-old girl with a history of dystrophy, microcephaly, and central hypothyroidism. Starting with gastrointestinal symptoms, the patient developed severe myocarditis followed by progressive multiple organ failure complicated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infection. Intensive care treatment consisting of invasive ventilation, drainage of pleural effusion, and high catecholamine therapy could not prevent the progression of heart failure, leading to the implantation of venoarterial extracorporeal life support (VA-ECLS) and additional left ventricle support catheter (Impella((R)) pump). Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and extracorporeal hemadsorption therapy (CytoSorb((R))) were initiated. Whole exome sequencing revealed a mutation of unknown significance in DExH-BOX helicase 30 (DHX30), a gene encoding a RNA helicase. COVID-19 specific antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment did not lead to viral clearance or control of hyperinflammation resulting in the patient's death on extracorporeal life support-(ECLS)-day 20. This fatal case illustrates the potential severity of pediatric COVID-19 and suggests further evaluation of antiviral treatment strategies and vaccination programs for children.	Case Report

Due to its easy transmissibility and high virulence, it has caused an overwhelming number of infections leading to a near-collapse of the healthcare infrastructure in some countries. In this review, we will focus on cases of Severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, as well as advanced rescue therapy in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).	Treatment
34226773	Change-point analysis through INAR process with application to some COVID-19 data. In this article, we consider the problem of change-point analysis for the count time series data through an integer-valued autoregressive process of order 1 (INAR(1)) with time-varying covariates. These types of features we observe in many real-life scenarios especially in the COVID-19 data sets where the number of active cases over time starts falling and then again increases. In order to capture those features, we use Poisson INAR(1) process with a time-varying smoothing covariate. By using such model, we can model both the components in the active cases at time-point t namely - (i) number of non-recovery cases from the previous time-point, and (ii) number of new cases at time-point t. We study some theoretical properties of the proposed model along with forecasting. Some simulation studies are performed to study the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, we analyze two COVID-19 data sets and compare our proposed model to another PINAR(1) process which has time-varying covariate but no change-point, to demonstrate the overall performance of our proposed model.

34203185	Significant Decrease in Annual Cancer Diagnoses in Spain during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Real-Data Study. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a profound change in health organizations at both the primary and hospital care levels. This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the annual rate of new cancer diagnosis in two university-affiliated hospitals. This study includes all the patients with a pathological diagnosis of cancer attended in two hospitals in Malaga (Spain) during the first year of pandemic. This study population was compared with the patients diagnosed during the previous year 2019. To analyze whether the possible differences in the annual rate of diagnoses were due to the pandemic or to other causes, the patients diagnosed during 2018 and 2017 were also compared. There were 2340 new cancer diagnosis compared to 2825 patients in 2019 which represented a decrease of -17.2% (p = 0.0001). Differences in the number of cancer patients diagnosed between 2018 and 2019 (2840 new cases; 0.5% increase) or 2017 and 2019 (2909 new cases; 3% increase) were not statistically significant. The highest number of patients lost from diagnosis in 2020 was in breast cancer (-26.1%), colorectal neoplasms (-16.9%), and head and neck tumors (-19.8%). The study of incidence rates throughout the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic shows that the diagnosis of new cancer patients has been significantly impaired. Health systems must take the necessary measures to restore pre-pandemic diagnostic procedures and to recover lost patients who have not been diagnosed.	Prevention
34222534	Assessment of knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19 among paramedical staff in Central India: A cross-sectional, online survey. BACKGROUND: Knowledge of a disease can influence paramedic's attitudes and practices, and incorrect attitudes and practices directly increase the risk of infection. Understanding paramedic's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) and possible risk factors helps to predict the outcomes of planned behavior. To assess KAP regarding COVID-19 through Google form among paramedical staff at tertiary care teaching institutes of central India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, multicentric, questionnaire-based study was conducted from May 2020 to August 2020 among 230 paramedical staff from two tertiary care teaching institutes through Google form. Data were analyzed by Chi-square test and parametric test using GraphPad prism software version 5.0. RESULTS: All participants had knowledge about symptomatology of COVID-19. However, significantly more participants in nursing cadre know about definition of close contact. The mean knowledge score was 4.84 +/- 0.6. The mean score for attitude was 4.48 +/- 0.83. Overall, 54.78% of paramedical staff follow correct prevention strategies. Of them, significantly more nursing staff correctly practice infection control measures upon arrival of COVID-19 patients (P = 0.033). There was a significant difference among both groups regarding wearing of appropriate personal protective equipment while transporting/accompanying patients who are confirmed with COVID 19 (P = 0.009). The overall score for practice is 3.97 +/- 1.03. The practice score was significantly better in nursing cadre as compared to nonnursing cadre (P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Majority of the participants had good knowledge and positive attitude. Nursing cadre follows better preventive practices as compared to nonnursing cadre while performing COVID-related duties. Considering these facts, dodges responsible for poor practices should be identified and resolved so that India will be able to conquest the battle against the disease.	Prevention
34208312	Associations between Indoor Environmental Quality and Infectious Diseases Knowledge, Beliefs and Practices of Hotel Workers in Wuhan, China. Knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding infectious diseases are key elements that ensure practitioners' health and safety. It is important to carry out such a survey in hotels. This study aims to determine the levels of knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding infectious diseases among practitioners and their associations with the environmental quality of hotels in Wuhan, China. We surveyed infectious disease knowledge, beliefs, and practices of practitioners in 18 hotels and detected these hotels' environment, including physical factors of temperature, humidity, noise, and the indoor air quality of benzene, toluene, xylene, formaldehyde, CO, CO2, the total count of fungi, aerobic plate count, PM10, and PM2.5. 128 practitioners were included, and 28.9% were male. The questionnaire included knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding infectious diseases. Our study found moderate levels of knowledge and beliefs, and good health practices. People's beliefs toward COVID-19 were correlated significantly with their knowledge (p < 0.05). Beliefs and health practices were correlated significantly with environmental quality (p < 0.05). However, the environmental quality was correlated negatively with the classification of hotels. Conclusively, despite the good health practices of practitioners, the knowledge and beliefs toward infectious diseases need to strengthen. Hotels should emphasize health education in practitioners and the improvement of environmental hygiene. Integrating all three components into a comprehensive environmental promotion program is warranted.	Prevention
34207161	COVID-19 Causing Hypotension in Frail Geriatric Hypertensive Patients? BACKGROUND: The association of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with hypertension has been one of the frequently discussed topics in current studies since hypertension was identified as a risk factor for coronavirus disease. However, no studies seem to be focused on the BP (blood pressure) in patients with hypertension after COVID-19. REPORT: This report presents the cases of five frail geriatric patients (avg. age 78.3 (+/-6.4) years) with sarcopenia and controlled hypertension (office BP < 140 mmHg) who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: Control ABPM performed after COVID-19 showed that these hypertensive patients were hypotensive and that the previously well-established therapy was suddenly too intensive for them. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that BP control after COVID-19 is needed and that ABPM is, particularly in frail geriatric patients, by no means a luxury but a necessity.	Case Report

Using RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry, we identified more than 100 human proteins that directly and specifically bind SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected cells. To gain insights into the functions of selected RNA interactors, we applied genetic perturbation and pharmacological inhibition experiments, and mapped the contact sites on the viral RNA. This led to the identification of host dependency factors and defense strategies, which can guide the design of novel therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.	Mechanism;Treatment

34132429	Promising traditional Indian medicinal plants for the management of novel Coronavirus disease: A systematic review. Traditional Indian medical practices (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and homeopathy) are a vast reservoir of knowledge about medicinal plants. The promising pharmacological properties of these plants have paved the way for developing therapy against novel Coronavirus (CoV) infection. The current review will summarize published works of literature on the effects of traditional Indian medicinal plants against acute respiratory infection (COVID-19, SARS, Influenza, and Respiratory syncytial virus infection) and registered clinical trials of traditional Indian herbal medicines in COVID-19. The current study aims to comprehensively evaluate the data of traditional Indian medicinal plants to warrant their use in COVID-19 management. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched along with different clinical trial databases. A total of 22 relevant traditional Indian medicinal plants (35 relevant studies) were included in the current study having potential antiviral properties against virus-induced respiratory illness along with promising immunomodulatory and thrombolytic properties. Further, 36 randomized and nonrandomized registered clinical trials were also included that were aimed at evaluating the efficacy of herbal plants or their formulations in COVID-19 management. The antiviral, immunomodulatory, and thrombolytic activities of the traditional Indian medicinal plants laid down a strong rationale for their use in developing therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study identified some important potential traditional Indian medicinal herbs such as Ocimum tenuiflorum, Tinospora cordifolia, Achyranthes bidentata, Cinnamomum cassia, Cydonia oblonga, Embelin ribes, Justicia adhatoda, Momordica charantia, Withania somnifera, Zingiber officinale, Camphor, and Kabusura kudineer, which could be used in therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

34285303	Kinetic characterisation and inhibitor sensitivity of Candida albicans and Candida auris recombinant AOX expressed in a self-assembled proteoliposome system. Candidemia caused by Candida spp. is a serious threat in hospital settings being a major cause of acquired infection and death and a possible contributor to Covid-19 mortality. Candidemia incidence has been rising worldwide following increases in fungicide-resistant pathogens highlighting the need for more effective antifungal agents with novel modes of action. The membrane-bound enzyme alternative oxidase (AOX) promotes fungicide resistance and is absent in humans making it a desirable therapeutic target. However, the lipophilic nature of the AOX substrate (ubiquinol-10) has hindered its kinetic characterisation in physiologically-relevant conditions. Here, we present the purification and expression of recombinant AOXs from C. albicans and C. auris in a self-assembled proteoliposome (PL) system. Kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) with respect to ubiquinol-10 have been determined. The PL system has also been employed in dose-response assays with novel AOX inhibitors. Such information is critical for the future development of novel treatments for Candidemia.	Mechanism;Treatment
34290822	Targeting SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 15 endoribonuclease: an in silico perspective. The newly emerged human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, had begun to spread last year and sparked worldwide. In this study, molecular docking is utilized to test some previously approved drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 15 (Nsp15). We screened 23 drugs, from which three (saquinavir, valrubicin and aprepitant) show a paramount predicted binding affinity (-9.1, -9.6 and -9.2 kcal/mol, respectively) against SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15. Moreover, saquinavir and aprepitant make nonbonded interactions with Leu201 in the active site cavity of Nsp15, while the drug valrubicin interacts with Arg199 and Leu201. This binding pattern may be effective against the targeted protein, leading to Nsp15 blockage and virus abolition. Additionally, the pharmacological properties of the screened drugs are known since they have been approved against different viruses.	Mechanism;Treatment
34203015	Clinical Significance of Micronutrient Supplementation in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients with Severe ARDS. The interplay between inflammation and oxidative stress is a vicious circle, potentially resulting in organ damage. Essential micronutrients such as selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) support anti-oxidative defense systems and are commonly depleted in severe disease. This single-center retrospective study investigated micronutrient levels under Se and Zn supplementation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and explored potential relationships with immunological and clinical parameters. According to intensive care unit (ICU) standard operating procedures, patients received 1.0 mg of intravenous Se daily on top of artificial nutrition, which contained various amounts of Se and Zn. Micronutrients, inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte subsets and clinical data were extracted from the patient data management system on admission and after 10 to 14 days of treatment. Forty-six patients were screened for eligibility and 22 patients were included in the study. Twenty-one patients (95%) suffered from severe ARDS and 14 patients (64%) survived to ICU discharge. On admission, the majority of patients had low Se status biomarkers and Zn levels, along with elevated inflammatory parameters. Se supplementation significantly elevated Se (p = 0.027) and selenoprotein P levels (SELENOP; p = 0.016) to normal range. Accordingly, glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) activity increased over time (p = 0.021). Se biomarkers, most notably SELENOP, were inversely correlated with CRP (rs = -0.495), PCT (rs = -0.413), IL-6 (rs = -0.429), IL-1beta (rs = -0.440) and IL-10 (rs = -0.461). Positive associations were found for CD8(+) T cells (rs = 0.636), NK cells (rs = 0.772), total IgG (rs = 0.493) and PaO2/FiO2 ratios (rs = 0.504). In addition, survivors tended to have higher Se levels after 10 to 14 days compared to non-survivors (p = 0.075). Sufficient Se and Zn levels may potentially be of clinical significance for an adequate immune response in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS.	Diagnosis;Treatment

34352870	Hemorrhagic stroke associated to COVID-19 infection in Mexico General Hospital. INTRODUCCION: en la actual pandemia de COVID-19, existe evidencia creciente que ha identificado el neurotropismo del virus SARS-CoV-2 y sus complicaciones neurologicas, incluida la enfermedad cerebrovascular isquemica y escasamente hemorragia cerebral (HC). OBJETIVO: describir las caracteristicas clinicas, radiologicas, de laboratorio y pronosticas de los pacientes con HC asociada al SARS-CoV-2. METODOS: se incluyeron pacientes consecutivos con prueba de PCR confirmatoria para infeccion por SARS-CoV-2 y HC. RESULTADOS: en un periodo de 90 dias, en un centro de referencia COVID-19 en Mexico, de 1108 pacientes con infeccion por SARS-CoV-2, se encontraron 4 pacientes (0.36%) con HC. Tenian una edad de 71(+/-12.2) anos, 2 eran mujeres. Se encontro que dos tenian factores de riesgo cardiovascular previos. En dos casos se encontro el origen en el nucleo dentado mientras que los otros dos correspondieron al talamo. Tres de los cuatro pacientes murieron. Postulamos que el descontrol hipertensivo, coagulopatia, trombocitopenia y la respuesta inmune inducida por el virus SARS-CoV-2 podrian desencadenar HC en un paciente con riesgo previo. CONCLUSIONES: la HC se asocia a la infeccion por SARS-CoV-2 con mal pronostico cuando se presenta. Los equipos de neurocirugia deben estar preparados para el tratamiento oportuno de estos pacientes. INTRODUCTION: In the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing body of evidence that has identified the neurotropism of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its neurological complications, including cerebrovascular disease, focusing mainly in ischemic and scarcely about hemorrhagic stroke (HS). OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to describe clinical, radiological, laboratory tests, and prognostic characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 associated HS. METHODS: Consecutive patients with a confirmatory PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection and a HS demonstrated by head CT were included in the study. RESULTS: Over a period of 90 days, in a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico, out of a total of 1108 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, it found 4 patients (0.36%) who meet criteria. They had an age of 71 (+/-12.2) years, 2 were women. It was found that two had prior cardiovascular risk factors. Two of the HS originated in the dentate nucleus while the other two corresponded to the thalamus. Three of the four patients died. We suggest that catastrophic uncontrolled blood pressure, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 could in a specific patient trigger HS. CONCLUSIONS: HS is associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection with poor prognosis when it presented. Neurosurgery teams should prepare for the timely and appropriate treatment of this patients.	Case Report
34355577	Efficiency of pooled surveillance testing in academic labs to detect and inhibit COVID-19 outbreaks. Robust surveillance testing is a key strategic plan to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks and slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; however, limited resources, facilities and time often impair the implementation of a widespread surveillance effort. To mitigate these resource limitations, we employed a strategy of pooling samples, reducing reagent cost and processing time. Through utilizing academic faculty and labs, successful pooled surveillance testing was conducted throughout Fall 2020 semester to detect positive SARS-CoV-2 infections in a population of 4400 students. During the semester, over 25,000 individual COVID status evaluations were made by pooling eight individual samples into one quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. This pooled surveillance strategy was highly effective at detecting infection and significantly reduced financial burden and cost by $3.6 million.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34379444	COVID-19 and Diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes in people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has varied worldwide. Most of the available evidence suggests a significant increase in severity and mortality of COVID-19 in people with either type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially in association with poor glycemic control. While new-onset hyperglycemia and new-onset diabetes (both T1DM and T2DM) have been increasingly recognized in the context of COVID-19 and have been associated with worse outcome, no conclusive evidence yet suggests direct tropism of SARS-CoV-2 on the beta cells of pancreatic islets. While all approved oral antidiabetic agents appear to be safe in people with T2DM having COVID-19, no conclusive data are yet available to indicate a mortality benefit with any class of these drugs, in the absence of large randomized controlled trials. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Medicine, Volume 73 is January 2022. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.	Treatment
34287229	Identification of Human SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies from Convalescent Patients Using EBV Immortalization. We report the isolation of two human IgG1k monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These mAbs were isolated from two donors who had recovered from COVID-19 infection during the first pandemic peak in the Lombardy region of Italy, the first European and initially most affected region in March 2020. We used the method of EBV immortalization of purified memory B cells and supernatant screening with a spike S1/2 assay for mAb isolation. This method allowed rapid isolation of clones, with one donor showing about 7% of clones positive against spike protein, whereas the other donor did not produce positive clones out of 91 tested. RNA was extracted from positive clones 39-47 days post-EBV infection, allowing VH and VL sequencing. The same clones were sequenced again after a further 100 days in culture, showing that no mutation had taken place during in vitro expansion. The B cell clones could be expanded in culture for more than 4 months after EBV immortalization and secreted the antibodies stably during that time, allowing to purify mg quantities of each mAb for functional assays without generating recombinant proteins. Unfortunately, neither mAb had significant neutralizing activity in a virus infection assay with several different SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The antibody sequences are made freely available.

34199663	"Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage 20I/501Y.V1 in a Nursing Home Underlines the Crucial Role of Vaccination in Both Residents and Staff. Elderly residents in nursing homes are at very high risk of life-threatening COVID-19-related outcomes. In this report, an epidemiological and serological investigation of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in an Italian nursing home is described. Among the residents, all but one (19/20) were regularly vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. In mid-February 2021, a non-vaccinated staff member of the nursing home was diagnosed with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following the outbreak investigation, a total of 70% (14/20) of residents aged 77-100 years were found positive. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the outbreak was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/01 (the so-called ""UK variant""). However, all but one positive subjects (13/14) were fully asymptomatic. The only symptomatic patient was a vaccinated 86-year-old female with a highly compromised health background and deceased approximately two weeks later. The subsequent serological investigation showed that the deceased patient was the only vaccinated subject that did not develop the anti-spike protein antibody response, therefore being likely a vaccine non-responder. Although the available mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was not able to prevent several asymptomatic infections, it was able to avert most symptomatic disease cases caused by the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/01 in nursing home residents."

34287208	Usability of Telemedicine in Physical Therapy Rehabilitation: Systematic review. BACKGROUND: The term 'Telemedicine' was coined in the 1970s to imply 'healing at a distance. Physical therapy rehabilitation (PTR) focuses on the re-institution of function in bodily strength and movement. Covid-19 has created a challenge in one-on-one PTR sessions due to social distancing, which requires the minimization of all non-essential physical contact. Most outpatient services in PTR have had to be staggered and minimized to increase adherence to social distancing requirements and flatten the pandemic's curve. Telemedicine is applicable in PTR in several ways, including guided therapy sessions, and remote monitoring of patient progress through videoconferencing. Telemedicine allows patients to access PTR from the comfort of their homes, which minimizes travel costs and general strain on the body. Although it has been encumbered by various challenges, telemedicine could revolutionize the delivery of PTR while also increasing access to essential healthcare services. OBJECTIVE: Purpose: Covering the main aspects of telemedicine usability in physical therapy rehabilitation, that encourage using of the telemedicine in physical therapy in the world regions not covered by, especially the Middle East. METHODS: Method: A systematic search in libgen.is, jmir.org, wiley.com, sagepub.com, and scholar.google.com. was performed using the search terms: Telemedicine; asynchronous telemedicine; synchronous telemedicine; Covid-19; rehabilitation medicine; physical therapy rehabilitation; videoconferencing; Medicaid programs; telehealth; and HIPAA. Papers published up to Oct. 22nd, 2020, in English, were included. RESULTS: Telemedicine is cost-effective for physical therapy Rehabilitation particularly in pandemic like COVID19, also it's time and human resources saving especially with hands-off skills rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is a revolutionary aspect of medicine that has seen an unexpected uptake following the Covid-19 pandemic. While people formerly preferred live sessions for PTR, the convenience of telemedicine is increasingly emerging. The various advantages, including reduced cost implications, reduced waiting time, and reduction of non-essential travel to obtain therapy have increased the preference for telemedicine. [9] The WHO recognizes the importance of Telemedicine, and conducted a regional and global survey to analyze its viability. At the onset of global lockdown due to Covid-19, the APTA expressed the need for physiotherapists to utilize telemedicine as an alternative for efficient PTR delivery within the bounds of social recommendations for curve-flattening. Telemedicine in PTR has various advantages including cost reduction, the convenience of access, reduction of long waiting lists among others for the patient. [10] PTR can also be availed to areas that are too remote to have a full-fledged PTR center. Through the utilization of nurse aides and other social support systems, therapists can effectively conduct therapy sessions through videoconferencing. Laws governing the adoption and use of telemedicine for PTR include the HIPAA and other DPL, which regulate the extent to which therapists can collect, use, and store data collected during online therapy sessions. Therapists need to obtain verifiable consent from the patient before commencement. CLINICALTRIAL:	Prevention
34281075	Overview of Canada's Answer to the COVID-19 Pandemic's First Wave (January-April 2020). Canada is a federal state of almost 38 million inhabitants distributed over ten provinces and three territories, each with their own power regarding health. This case study describes the health infrastructures' situation before the COVID-19 outbreak and their adaptations to face the expected cases, the available epidemiologic data for the beginning of the first wave (January-April 2020), and the public health and economic measures taken to control the pandemic both at the federal level and breaking down by province and territory. Canadian health infrastructures offered on average 12.9 intensive care units beds per 100,000 (occupancy rate ~90% before the outbreak), unevenly distributed across provinces and territories. Canada implemented public health measures, such as social distancing, when hospitalization and death rates due to the pandemic were still lower than in other countries; each province and territory adapted and implemented specific measures. Cumulated cases and deaths substantially increased from mid-March 2020, reaching 65 cases and 2 deaths per 100,000 on April 12, with strong differences across provinces and territories. Canada has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic's first wave with a generally slower dynamic than in the USA or in the European Union at the same period. This suggests that implementation of public health measures when health indicators were still low may have been efficient in Canada; yet the long-term care sector faced many challenges in some provinces, which drove a large part of the pandemic indicators.

34290390	Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in 45,965 adults from the general population of the United Kingdom. We report that in a cohort of 45,965 adults, who were receiving either the ChAdOx1 or the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, in those who had no prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, seroconversion rates and quantitative antibody levels after a single dose were lower in older individuals, especially in those aged >60 years. Two vaccine doses achieved high responses across all ages. Antibody levels increased more slowly and to lower levels with a single dose of ChAdOx1 compared with a single dose of BNT162b2, but waned following a single dose of BNT162b2 in older individuals. In descriptive latent class models, we identified four responder subgroups, including a 'low responder' group that more commonly consisted of people aged >75 years, males and individuals with long-term health conditions. Given our findings, we propose that available vaccines should be prioritized for those not previously infected and that second doses should be prioritized for individuals aged >60 years. Further data are needed to better understand the extent to which quantitative antibody responses are associated with vaccine-mediated protection.	Treatment
34287285	Abnormal Liver Biochemistry Tests and Acute Liver Injury in COVID-19 Patients: Current Evidence and Potential Pathogenesis. Globally, millions of persons have contracted the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) over the past several months, resulting in significant mortality. Health care systems are negatively impacted including the care of individuals with cancers and other chronic diseases such as chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are various probable pathogenic mechanisms that have been presented to account for liver injury in COVID-19 patients such as hepatotoxicity cause by therapeutic drugs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of the bile duct cells and hepatocytes, hypoxia and systemic inflammatory response. Liver biochemistry tests such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are deranged in COVID-19 patients with liver injury. Hepatocellular damage results in the elevation of serum AST and ALT levels in early onset disease while a cholestatic pattern that develops as the disease progress causes higher levels of ALP, GGT, direct and total bilirubin. These liver biochemistry tests are prognostic markers of disease severity and should be carefully monitored in COVID-19 patients. We conducted a systematic review of abnormal liver biochemistry tests in COVID-19 and the possible pathogenesis involved. Significant findings regarding the severity, hepatocellular pattern, incidence and related clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients are highlighted.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34335535	Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 Altered the Bonding Network With Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 to Evade Host Immune System. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been continuously mutating since its first emergence in early 2020. These alterations have led this virus to gain significant difference in infectivity, pathogenicity, and host immune evasion. We previously found that the open-reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2 can inhibit interferon production by decreasing the nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Since several mutations in ORF8 have been observed, therefore, in the present study, we adapted structural and biophysical analysis approaches to explore the impact of various mutations of ORF8, such as S24L, L84S, V62L, and W45L, the recently circulating mutant in Pakistan, on its ability to bind IRF3 and to evade the host immune system. We found that mutations in ORF8 could affect the binding efficiency with IRF3 based on molecular docking analysis, which was further supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Among all the reported mutations, W45L was found to bind most stringently to IRF3. Our analysis revealed that mutations in ORF8 may help the virus evade the immune system by changing its binding affinity with IRF3.	Mechanism;Treatment
34222840	Food-trade-associated COVID-19 outbreak from a contaminated wholesale food supermarket in Beijing. The re-emerging outbreak of COVID-19 in Beijing, China, in the summer of 2020 originated from a SARS-CoV-2-infested wholesale food supermarket. We postulated that the Xinfadi market outbreak has links with food-trade activities. Our Susceptible to the disease, Infectious, and Recovered coupled Agent Based Modelling (SIR-ABM) analysis for studying the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 particles suggested that the trade-distancing strategy effectively reduces the reproduction number (R0). The retail shop closure strategy reduced the number of visitors to the market by nearly half. In addition, the buy-local policy option reduced the infection by more than 70% in total. Therefore, retail closures and buy-local policies could serve as significantly effective strategies that have the potential to reduce the size of the outbreak and prevent probable outbreaks in the future.

34338591	Evolving ribonucleocapsid assembly/packaging signals in the genomes of the human and animal coronaviruses: targeting, transmission and evolution. A world-wide COVID-19 pandemic intensified strongly the studies of molecular mechanisms related to the coronaviruses. The origin of coronaviruses and the risks of human-to-human, animal-to-human and human-to-animal transmission of coronaviral infections can be understood only on a broader evolutionary level by detailed comparative studies. In this paper, we studied ribonucleocapsid assembly-packaging signals (RNAPS) in the genomes of all seven known pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 and compared them with RNAPS in the genomes of the related animal coronaviruses including SARS-Bat-CoV, MERS-Camel-CoV, MHV, Bat-CoV MOP1, TGEV and one of camel alphacoronaviruses. RNAPS in the genomes of coronaviruses were evolved due to weakly specific interactions between genomic RNA and N proteins in helical nucleocapsids. Combining transitional genome mapping and Jaccard correlation coefficients allows us to perform the analysis directly in terms of underlying motifs distributed over the genome. In all coronaviruses, RNAPS were distributed quasi-periodically over the genome with the period about 54 nt biased to 57 nt and to 51 nt for the genomes longer and shorter than that of SARS-CoV, respectively. The comparison with the experimentally verified packaging signals for MERS-CoV, MHV and TGEV proved that the distribution of particular motifs is strongly correlated with the packaging signals. We also found that many motifs were highly conserved in both characters and positioning on the genomes throughout the lineages that make them promising therapeutic targets. The mechanisms of encapsidation can affect the recombination and co-infection as well.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.	Mechanism;Transmission
34366663	COVID-19: Vaccine Delivery System, Drug Repurposing and Application of Molecular Modeling Approach. The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread across the world, resulting in a pandemic COVID-19 which is a human zoonotic disease that is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) strain thought to have originated in wild or captive bats in the initial COVID outbreak region. The global COVID-19 outbreak started in Guangdong Province, China's southernmost province. The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the sheer number of infected people, many of whom need intensive care before succumbing to the disease. The epidemic is being handled by a combination of disease control by public health interventions and compassionate treatment for those who have been impacted. There is no clear anti-COVID-19 medication available at this time. However, the need to find medications that can turn the tide has led to the development of a number of investigational drugs as potential candidates for improving outcomes, especially in the severely and critically ill. Although many of these adjunctive medications are still being studied in clinical trials, professional organizations have attempted to define the circumstances in which their use is deemed off-label or compassionate. It is important to remind readers that new information about COVID-19's clinical features, treatment options, and outcomes is released on a regular basis. The mainstay of treatment remains optimized supportive care, and the therapeutic effectiveness of the subsequent agents is still being studied.	Treatment
34216735	Immunological predictors of disease severity in patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Identifying the immune cells involved in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease progression and the predictors of poor outcomes is important to manage patients adequately. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a tertiary hospital in Oman and 53 non-hospitalized patients with confirmed mild COVID-19. RESULTS: Hospitalized patients were older (58 years vs 36 years, P < 0.001) and had more comorbid conditions such as diabetes (65% vs 21% P < 0.001). Hospitalized patients had significantly higher inflammatory markers (P < 0.001): C-reactive protein (114 vs 4 mg/l), interleukin 6 (IL-6) (33 vs 3.71 pg/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (417 vs 214 U/l), ferritin (760 vs 196 ng/ml), fibrinogen (6 vs 3 g/l), D-dimer (1.0 vs 0.3 mug/ml), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy score (2 vs 0), and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (4 vs 1.1) (P < 0.001). On multivariate regression analysis, statistically significant independent early predictors of intensive care unit admission or death were higher levels of IL-6 (odds ratio 1.03, P = 0.03), frequency of large inflammatory monocytes (CD14+CD16+) (odds ratio 1.117, P = 0.010), and frequency of circulating naive CD4+ T cells (CD27+CD28+CD45RA+CCR7+) (odds ratio 0.476, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: IL-6, the frequency of large inflammatory monocytes, and the frequency of circulating naive CD4 T cells can be used as independent immunological predictors of poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients to prioritize critical care and resources.

34220842	Antiphospholipid Antibodies and Infection: Non Nova Sed Nove. The clinical significance of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the context of infections has attracted attention since their first discovery in patients with syphilis. In fact, the recognition of aPL in patients with infections has been described in parallel to the understating of the syndrome. Since the first description of aPL-positive tests in three patients with COVID-19 diagnosed in January 2020 in Wuhan, China, a large number of studies took part in the ongoing debate on SARS-2-Cov 2 induced coagulopathy, and many following reports speculated a potential role for aPL. In order to get further insights on the effective role of detectable aPL in the pro-thrombotic status observed in COVID-19 patients, we performed an observational age-sex controlled study to compare the aPL profile of hospitalized patients with COVID with those observed in a) patients with thrombotic APS and b) patients with cultural/serologically-proved infections. Our data showed positive aPL testing in about half of the patients (53%) with COVID-19 and patients with other viral/bacterial infections (49%). However, aPL profile was different when comparing patients with overt APS and patients with aPL detected in the contest of infections. Caution is therefore required in the interpretation and generalization of the role of aPL s in the management of patients with COVID-19. Before introducing aPL testing as a part of the routine testing in patients with COVID-19, larger well-designed clinical studies are required. While the pro-thrombotic status in patients with COVID-19 is now unquestionable, different mechanisms other than aPL should be further investigated.	Diagnosis
34228355	Investigation of plasma exchange and hemoperfusion effects and complications for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) disease: A systematic scoping review. Some previous studies suggested that the plasma exchange (PE) and hemoperfusion (HP) played a cardinal role in the treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases by diminishing the cytokine storm. This study aimed to assess the effects of PE and HP on cytokine storms in patients with severe COVID-19 through a systematic scoping review. Four Electronic databases (Medline [accessed from PubMed], Scopus, Science Direct, and Cochrane library) were searched systematically on February 2, 2021, using MESH terms and related keywords in the English language. Considering the titles and abstracts, unrelated studies were excluded. The full texts of the remained studies were evaluated by authors, independently. Then, their findings were assessed and reported. A total of 755 articles were obtained within the first step of searching, and 518 remained after removing the duplications. Through the title and abstract screening, 438 were removed. Of the rest, 59 papers were excluded. Finally, after reading the full text of the remained articles, 21 were included in data extraction. Most of the previously reported evidence were case reports and case series. Findings were summarized in two categories. The first category encompassed nine studies regarding HP and continuous renal replacement therapy, and the second category included twelve studies about PE. The results revealed that HP and PE within the cytokine storm phase would be beneficial with a high probability in the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Highlights Some studies showed that plasma exchange (PE) and hemoperfusion (HP) played an important role in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. The results of this systematic scoping review revealed that HP and PE within the cytokine storm phase would be beneficial with a high probability in the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients.

34358081	ADME and Pharmacokinetic Properties of Remdesivir: Its Drug Interaction Potential. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic, which tested healthcare systems, administrations, and treatment ingenuity across the world. COVID-19 is caused by the novel beta coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the inception of the pandemic, treatment options have been either limited or ineffective. Remdesivir, a drug originally designed to be used for Ebola virus, has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and has been included in the COVID-19 treatment regimens. Remdesivir is an adenosine nucleotide analog prodrug that is metabolically activated to a nucleoside triphosphate metabolite (GS-443902). The active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite is incorporated into the SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral chains, preventing its replication. The lack of reported drug development and characterization studies with remdesivir in public domain has created a void where information on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination (ADME) properties, pharmacokinetics (PK), or drug-drug interaction (DDI) is limited. By understanding these properties, clinicians can prevent subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic levels of remdesivir and thus avoid further complications in COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir is metabolized by both cytochrome P450 (CYP) and non-CYP enzymes such as carboxylesterases. In this narrative review, we have evaluated the currently available ADME, PK, and DDI information about remdesivir and have discussed the potential of DDIs between remdesivir and different COVID-19 drug regimens and agents used for comorbidities. Considering the nascent status of remdesivir in the therapeutic domain, extensive future work is needed to formulate safer COVID-19 treatment guidelines involving this medication.	Treatment
34227776	Isolated Acute Cerebrovascular Involvement in COVID-19 without Fever and Respiratory Symptoms: An Indian Perspective. Background: Stroke in COVID-19 has been reported in critically ill patients globally. Stroke as a singular manifestation of COVID-19 in absence of typical symptoms (fever, cough and dyspnea) is under- recognized. Objective: Comparative study of clinical and laboratory parameters of COVID-19 stroke patients without typical symptoms at onset with stroke cases without COVID-19 infection. Methods: 28consecutive stroke patients, eight with coronavirus infection and twenty without COVID-19 admitted to neurology department of a tertiary care centre of North West India between 20 June,2020 and 19 July,2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Results: COVID-19 patients had higher frequency of seizures (4[50%]) vs 2[10%];p= 0.03)and altered mental status(6[75%] vs 6[30%] p= 0.04). Severity of ischemic stroke(NIHSS >20, 3[75 %] vs 2[18%])and mortality(p=0.04)despite comparable vascular risk factors for stroke between the two groups was higher in COVID-19 patients. Three out of four COVID-19 young strokes died. Two females with COVID-19 did not develop any typical symptoms, six males(75%) developed fever with dyspnea after a mean delay of 2.7 days(Standard deviation 1.7) from stroke onset. All six patients who developed fever subsequently expired. Inflammatory markers (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio;p<0.001and ESR: p<0.001), transaminases(p=0.038) and creatinine (p=0.009) were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Isolated cerebrovascular involvement can be a presentation of COVID-19.Stroke severity and mortality is higher in COVID-19 with young strokes being no exemption. Development of fever was associated with clinical worsening. COVID-19 pandemic is far from over in India, such atypical presentations need to be recognized early and warrant stringent diagnostic protocols.	Diagnosis;Treatment
32437117	Feasibility of Social Distancing Practices in US Schools to Reduce Influenza Transmission During a Pandemic. BACKGROUND: Schools are socially dense environments, and school-based outbreaks often predate and fuel community-wide transmission of seasonal and pandemic influenza. While preemptive school closures can effectively reduce influenza transmission, they are disruptive and currently recommended only for pandemics. We assessed the feasibility of implementing other social distancing practices in K-12 schools as a first step in seeking an alternative to preemptive school closures. METHODS: We conducted 36 focus groups with education and public health officials across the United States. We identified and characterized themes and compared feasibility of practices by primary versus secondary school and region of the United States. RESULTS: Participants discussed 29 school practices (25 within-school practices implemented as part of the school day and 4 reduced-schedule practices that impact school hours). Participants reported that elementary schools commonly implement several within-school practices as part of routine operations such as homeroom stay, restriction of hall movement, and staggering of recess times. Because of routine implementation and limited use of individualized schedules within elementary schools, within-school practices were generally felt to be more feasible for elementary schools than secondary schools. Of reduced-schedule practices, shortening the school week and the school day was considered the most feasible; however, reduced-schedule practices were generally perceived to be less feasible than within-school practices for all grade levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that schools have many options to increase social distance other than closing. Future research should evaluate which of these seemingly feasible practices are effective in reducing influenza transmission in schools and surrounding communities.	Prevention
34199760	3' Tth Endonuclease Cleavage Polymerase Chain Reaction (3TEC-PCR) Technology for Single-Base-Specific Multiplex Pathogen Detection using a Two-Oligonucleotide System. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the standard in nucleic acid amplification technology for infectious disease pathogen detection and has been the primary diagnostic tool employed during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Various PCR technology adaptations, typically using two-oligonucleotide dye-binding methods or three-oligonucleotide hydrolysis probe systems, enable real-time multiplex target detection or single-base specificity for the identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A small number of two-oligonucleotide PCR systems facilitating both multiplex detection and SNP identification have been reported; however, these methods often have limitations in terms of target specificity, production of variable or false-positive results, and the requirement for extensive optimisation or post-amplification analysis. This study introduces 3' Tth endonuclease cleavage PCR (3TEC-PCR), a two-oligonucleotide PCR system incorporating a modified primer/probe and a thermostable cleavage enzyme, Tth endonuclease IV, for real-time multiplex detection and SNP identification. Complete analytical specificity, low limits of detection, single-base specificity, and simultaneous multiple target detection have been demonstrated in this study using 3TEC-PCR to identify bacterial meningitis associated pathogens. This is the first report of a two-oligonucleotide, real-time multiplex PCR technology with single-base specificity using Tth endonuclease IV.	Diagnosis
34204918	Could a New COVID-19 Mutant Strain Undermine Vaccination Efforts? A Mathematical Modelling Approach for Estimating the Spread of B.1.1.7 Using Ontario, Canada, as a Case Study. Infections represent highly dynamic processes, characterized by evolutionary changes and events that involve both the pathogen and the host. Among infectious agents, viruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the infectious agent responsible for the currently ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic, have a particularly high mutation rate. Taking into account the mutational landscape of an infectious agent, it is important to shed light on its evolution capability over time. As new, more infectious strains of COVID-19 emerge around the world, it is imperative to estimate when these new strains may overtake the wild-type strain in different populations. Therefore, we developed a general-purpose framework to estimate the time at which a mutant variant is able to take over a wild-type strain during an emerging infectious disease outbreak. In this study, we used COVID-19 as a case-study; however, the model is adaptable to any emerging pathogen. We devised a two-strain mathematical framework to model a wild- and a mutant-type viral population and fit cumulative case data to parameterize the model, using Ontario as a case study. We found that, in the context of under-reporting and the current case levels, a variant strain was unlikely to dominate until March/April 2021. The current non-pharmaceutical interventions in Ontario need to be kept in place longer even with vaccination in order to prevent another outbreak. The spread of a variant strain in Ontario will likely be observed by a widened peak of the daily reported cases. If vaccine efficacy is maintained across strains, then it is still possible to achieve high levels of immunity in the population by the end of 2021. Our findings have important practical implications in terms of public health as policy- and decision-makers are equipped with a mathematical tool that can enable the estimation of the take-over of a mutant strain of an emerging infectious disease.

34203821	COVID-19 Vaccine Priority Strategy Using a Heterogenous Transmission Model Based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation in the Republic of Korea. (1) Background: The vaccine supply is likely to be limited in 2021 due to constraints in manufacturing. To maximize the benefit from the rollout phase, an optimal strategy of vaccine allocation is necessary based on each country's epidemic status. (2) Methods: We first developed a heterogeneous population model considering the transmission matrix using maximum likelihood estimation based on the epidemiological records of individual COVID-19 cases in the Republic of Korea. Using this model, the vaccine priorities for minimizing mortality or incidence were investigated. (3) Results: The simulation results showed that the optimal vaccine allocation strategy to minimize the mortality (or incidence) was to prioritize elderly and healthcare workers (or adults) as long as the reproductive number was below 1.2 (or over 0.9). (4) Conclusion: Our simulation results support the current Korean government vaccination priority strategy, which prioritizes healthcare workers and senior groups to minimize mortality, under the condition that the reproductive number remains below 1.2. This study revealed that, in order to maintain the current vaccine priority policy, it is important to ensure that the reproductive number does not exceed the threshold by concurrently implementing nonpharmaceutical interventions.

34210271	E-prescribing and access to prescription medicines during lockdown: experience of patients in Aotearoa/New Zealand. BACKGROUND: Health services internationally have been compelled to change their methods of service delivery in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, to mitigate the spread of infection amongst health professionals and patients. In Aotearoa/New Zealand, widespread electronic delivery of prescriptions (e-prescribing) was enabled. The aim of the research was to explore patients' experiences of how lockdown, changes to prescribing and the interface between general practices and community pharmacy affected access to prescription medications. METHOD: The research employed a mixed-method approach. This included an online survey (n = 1,010) and in-depth interviews with a subset of survey respondents (n = 38) during the first COVID-19 lockdown (March-May 2020). Respondents were recruited through a snowballing approach, starting with social media and email list contacts of the research team. In keeping with the approach, descriptive statistics of survey data and thematic analysis of qualitative interview and open-ended questions in survey data were combined. RESULTS: For most respondents who received a prescription during lockdown, this was sent directly to the pharmacy. Most people picked up their medication from the pharmacy; home delivery of medication was rare (4%). Survey and interview respondents wanted e-prescribing to continue post-lockdown and described where things worked well and where they encountered delays in the process of acquiring prescription medication. CONCLUSIONS: E-prescribing has the potential to improve access to prescription medication and is convenient for patients. The increase in e-prescribing during lockdown highlighted how the system could be improved, through better feedback about errors, more consistency across practices and pharmacies, more proactive communication with patients, and equitable prescribing costs.

34202429	Intranasal Vaccination Strategy to Control the COVID-19 Pandemic from a Veterinary Medicine Perspective. The world is currently facing an ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The disease is a highly contagious respiratory disease which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Current control measures used by many countries include social distancing, wearing face masks, frequent hand washing, self-isolation, and vaccination. The current commercially available vaccines are injectable vaccines, although a few intranasal vaccines are in trial stages. The reported side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, perceptions towards the safety of the vaccines, and frequent mutation of the virus may lead to poor herd immunity. In veterinary medicine, attaining herd immunity is one of the main considerations in disease control, and herd immunity depends on the use of efficacious vaccines and the vaccination coverage in a population. Hence, many aerosol or intranasal vaccines have been developed to control veterinary respiratory diseases such as Newcastle disease, rinderpest, infectious bronchitis, and haemorrhagic septicaemia. Different vaccine technologies could be employed to improve vaccination coverage, including the usage of an intranasal live recombinant vaccine or live mutant vaccine. This paper discusses the potential use of intranasal vaccination strategies against human COVID-19, based on a veterinary intranasal vaccine strategy.	Treatment
34210553	Laryngotracheal aspiration test reduce the false negative rate in patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 pneumonia despite a negative nasopharyngeal swab. BACKGROUND: In the emergency department (ED) definitive diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 pneumonia is challenging as nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) can give false negative results. Strategies to reduce false negative rate of NPS have limitations. Serial NPSs (24-48 h from one another) are time-consuming, sputum can not be collected in the majority of patients, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), the most sensitive test, requires specific expertise. Laryngotracheal aspiration (LTA) is easy to perform and showed a similar accuracy to BAL for diagnosis of other pulmonary diseases, however it was not studied to diagnose SARS-COV-2 pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: An observational cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the negative predictive value of LTA in patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 pneumonia despite a negative NPS. METHODS: In the EDs of two university hospitals, consecutive patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 pneumonia despite a negative NPS underwent LTA performed with a nasotracheal tube connected to a vacuum system. Final diagnosis based on all respiratory specimen tests (NPS, LTA and BAL) and hospital data was established by two reviewers and in case of discordance by a third reviewer. RESULTS: 117 patients were enrolled. LTA was feasible in all patients and no patients experienced adverse events. Fifteen (12.7%) patients were diagnosed with community-acquired SARS-COV-2 pneumonia: 13 LTA positive and only 2 (1.7%) LTA negative. The negative predictive value of NPS and LTA was 87.3% (79.9% - 92.7%) and 98.1% (93.3%99.8%) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: LTA resulted feasible, safe and reduced false negative rate in patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 pneumonia despite a negative NPS.	Diagnosis
34223144	Antibiotic prescribing patterns in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: lessons from the first wave. Background: A high proportion of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotics despite evidence to show low levels of true bacterial coinfection. Methods: A retrospective cohort study examining antibiotic prescribing patterns of 300 patients sequentially diagnosed with COVID-19. Patients were grouped into 3 sub-cohorts: Group 1 received no antibiotics, Group 2 received antibiotics for microbiologically confirmed infections and Group 3 was empirically treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. The primary aim was to identify factors that influenced prescription and continuation of antibiotics in Group 3. Secondary aims were to examine differences in outcomes between groups. Results: In total, 292 patients were included (63 Group 1, 35 Group 2, 194 Group 3), median age was 60 years (IQR 44-76) and the majority were ethnically Irish (62%). The median duration of antibiotics was 7 days (IQR 5-10). In Group 3, factors associated with prescription IV antibiotics on admission were raised C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.024), increased age (P = 0.023), higher quick SOFA (P = 0.016) score and fever >37.5 degrees C (P = 0.011). Factors associated with duration of antibiotic course were duration of hypoxia (P < 0.001) and maximum respiratory support requirement (P = 0.013). Twenty-one patients in Group 3 had one or more antibiotic escalation events, most (n = 139) had no escalation or de-escalation of therapy. Conclusions: Duration of hypoxia and need for respiratory support may have acted as surrogate measures of improvement where usual response measures (CRP, neutrophilia, culture clearance) were absent. Continuous review of antibiotic prescriptions should be at the forefront of clinical management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34205434	Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Antibody Titers in Cord Blood after COVID-19 Vaccination during Pregnancy in Polish Healthcare Workers: Preliminary Results. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has given rise to the need to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible. As pregnant women are at increased risk of contracting severe COVID-19, with higher mortality, it is essential to assess the safety of the vaccines administered during pregnancy. METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine the titer of specific maternal and cord antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 S protein after antenatal vaccination. The secondary objective was to evaluate the ratio of the umbilical cord to the maternal antibody titers. Patients included in the study were enrolled after undergoing voluntary vaccination against COVID-19 during pregnancy at different weeks of gestation. All patients analyzed in our initial study were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: The results of the current study document high anti-S total IgG antibody titers in cord serum at birth in all mother-infant pairs analyzed. The mean umbilical cord blood sample IgG antibody titer anti-S protein was 1026.51 U/mL (+/-SD 769.25). The mean cord-to-maternal anti-S IgG antibody ratio was 1.28 (+/-SD 0.798). A significant positive correlation was observed between the week of gestation at which the first dose was administered and the week of gestation at which the second dose was administered, and the respective cord-to-maternal ratio (r = 0.48; p = 0.0029) for the first dose and (r = 0.39; p = 0.0102) for the second dose. CONCLUSIONS: To date, despite the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination, there is a lack of conclusive evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of vaccination of pregnant women. Therefore, the results we present are complementary. Our study suggests that maternal immunization may provide neonatal protection through the transplacental transfer of antibodies. Of particular importance is the demonstration that antibody transfer is correlated with the time from vaccination to delivery, which may allow future determination of the optimal timing of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women.

34219428	Understanding the principles of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) provides respiratory support to patients without the need for invasive intubation. Although it has been used for several years in critical care, NPPV has come to prominence as a management option for certain patients with respiratory complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This has led to increased care provision by nurses with little or no experience and expertise in critical care and NPPV. This article provides an overview of the principles of NPPV and its use in type 1 and type 2 respiratory failure. It explains the pathophysiology of several conditions that often lead to respiratory failure and how NPPV can mitigate respiratory failure and improve gas exchange. An individualised assessment of the patient's suitability for NPPV and an evaluation of the effectiveness of the therapy are crucial to ensure its safe and effective use. Nurses also have an important role in providing explanations and support to patients.	Treatment
34215243	Maternal mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico: a preliminary analysis during the first year. BACKGROUND: In Mexico, the COVID-19 pandemic led to preventative measures such as confinement and social interaction limitations that paradoxically may have aggravated healthcare access disparities for pregnant women and accentuated health system weaknesses addressing high-risk patients' pregnancies. Our objective is to estimate the maternal mortality ratio in 1 year and analyze the clinical course of pregnant women hospitalized due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective surveillance study of the national maternal mortality was performed from February 2020-February 2021 in Mexico related to COVID-19 cases in pregnant women, including their outcomes. Comparisons were made between patients who died and those who survived to identify prognostic factors and underlying health conditions distribution. RESULTS: Maternal Mortality Ratio increased by 56.8% in the studied period, confirmed COVID-19 was the cause of 22.93% of cases. Additionally, unconfirmed cases represented 4.5% of all maternal deaths. Among hospitalized pregnant women with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome consistent with COVID-19, smoking and cardiovascular diseases were more common among patients who faced a fatal outcome. They were also more common in the age group of < 19 or > 38. In addition, pneumonia was associated with asthma and immune impairment, while diabetes and increased BMI increased the odds for death (Odds Ratio 2.30 and 1.70, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal Mortality Ratio in Mexico increased over 60% in 1 year during the pandemic; COVID-19 was linked to 25.4% of maternal deaths in the studied period. Lethality among pregnant women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 was 2.8%, and while asthma and immune impairment increased propensity for developing pneumonia, obesity and diabetes increased the odds for in-hospital death. Measures are needed to improve access to coordinated well-organized healthcare to reduce maternal deaths related to COVID-19 and pandemic collateral effects.	Treatment;Prevention

Whether monoclonal antibodies are able to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern has been investigated using pseudoviruses. In this study we show that bamlanivimab, casirivimab, and imdevimab efficiently neutralise authentic SARS-CoV-2 including variant B.1.1.7 (Alpha) but variants B.1.351 (Beta) and P.2 (Zeta) were resistant against bamlanivimab and partially to casirivimab.

34289053	The virological impacts of SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation. The coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 has caused more than 140 million infections worldwide by the end of April 2021. As an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 underwent constant evolution that produced novel variants carrying mutation conferring fitness advantages. The current prevalent D614G variant, with glycine substituted for aspartic acid at position 614 in the spike glycoprotein (S protein), is one of such variants that became the main circulating strain worldwide in a short period of time. Over the past year, intensive studies from all over the world had defined the epidemiological characteristics of this highly contagious variant and revealed the underlying mechanisms. This review aims at presenting an overall picture of the impacts of D614G mutation on virus transmission, elucidating the underlying mechanisms of D614G in virus pathogenicity, and providing insights into the development of effective therapeutics.

34201860	Investigation of the Efficiency of Mask Wearing, Contact Tracing, and Case Isolation during the COVID-19 Outbreak. Case isolation and contact tracing are two essential parts of control measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, however, additional interventions, such as mask wearing, are required. Taiwan successfully contained local COVID-19 transmission after the initial imported cases in the country in early 2020 after applying the above-mentioned interventions. In order to explain the containment of the disease spread in Taiwan and understand the efficiency of different non-pharmaceutical interventions, a mathematical model has been developed. A stochastic model was implemented in order to estimate the effectiveness of mask wearing together with case isolation and contact tracing. We investigated different approaches towards mask usage, estimated the effect of the interventions on the basic reproduction number (R0), and simulated the possibility of controlling the outbreak. With the assumption that non-medical and medical masks have 20% and 50% efficiency, respectively, case isolation works on 100%, 70% of all people wear medical masks, and R0 = 2.5, there is almost 80% probability of outbreak control with 60% contact tracing, whereas for non-medical masks the highest probability is only about 20%. With a large proportion of infectiousness before the onset of symptoms (40%) and the presence of asymptomatic cases, the investigated interventions (isolation of cases, contact tracing, and mask wearing by all people), implemented on a high level, can help to control the disease spread. Superspreading events have also been included in our model in order to estimate their impact on the outbreak and to understand how restrictions on gathering and social distancing can help to control the outbreak. The obtained quantitative results are in agreement with the empirical COVID-19 data in Taiwan.	Prevention
34286830	SwabExpress: An end-to-end protocol for extraction-free covid-19 testing. BACKGROUND: The urgent need for massively scaled clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2, along with global shortages of critical reagents and supplies, has necessitated development of streamlined laboratory testing protocols. Conventional nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 involves collection of a clinical specimen with a nasopharyngeal swab in transport medium, nucleic acid extraction, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (1). As testing has scaled across the world, the global supply chain has buckled, rendering testing reagents and materials scarce (2). To address shortages, we developed SwabExpress, an end-to-end protocol developed to employ mass produced anterior nares swabs and bypass the requirement for transport media and nucleic acid extraction. METHODS: We evaluated anterior nares swabs, transported dry and eluted in low-TE buffer as a direct-to-RT-qPCR alternative to extraction-dependent viral transport media. We validated our protocol of using heat treatment for viral inactivation and added a proteinase K digestion step to reduce amplification interference. We tested this protocol across archived and prospectively collected swab specimens to fine-tune test performance. RESULTS: After optimization, SwabExpress has a low limit of detection at 2-4 molecules/uL, 100% sensitivity, and 99.4% specificity when compared side-by-side with a traditional RT-qPCR protocol employing extraction. On real-world specimens, SwabExpress outperforms an automated extraction system while simultaneously reducing cost and hands-on time. CONCLUSION: SwabExpress is a simplified workflow that facilitates scaled testing for COVID-19 without sacrificing test performance. It may serve as a template for the simplification of PCR-based clinical laboratory tests, particularly in times of critical shortages during pandemics.	Diagnosis
34204779	An Evaluation of the Hand Hygiene Behaviour and Compliance of the General Public When Using Public Restrooms in Northern Ireland (NI) during the Initial Weeks of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic. BACKGROUND: The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has resulted in significant levels of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among the elderly and immuno-suppressed groups. Although adequate hand hygiene (HH) behaviour and compliance is widely accepted as being the most effective self-protective measure in preventing the spread of diseases like COVID-19, previous research suggests that normal hand hygiene compliance is poor, but generally improves during a disease pandemic. This research aimed to evaluate the hand hygiene behaviour and compliance of the general public in the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Ireland (NI). METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved the use of infrared-imaging cameras to observe the hand hygiene behaviour and compliance of the general public when using one set of male and female public restrooms. RESULTS: The findings of this study indicated that the level of hand hygiene compliance of the general public was poor in the initial weeks, with 82.93% overall not washing their hands adequately. CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate HH behaviour and compliance may have added significantly to the rapid rate of spread of COVID-19 in the initial weeks of the pandemic in NI. Current public health campaigns do not appear, based on this study, to have the desired impact and may need to be reviewed or re-enforced in order to achieve the levels of hand hygiene compliance required to slow the spread of COVID-19 and other communicable diseases in the future.

34343362	Physical recovery of COVID-19 pneumosepsis ICU survivors compared with non-COVID pneumosepsis ICU survivors during post-ICU hospitalization: The RECOVID retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumosepsis survivors are at a high risk of developing ICU acquired weakness (ICUAW), due to high incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome and the common need for prolonged invasive ventilation. It remains unknown if regular post-pneumosepsis physical rehabilitation strategies are suitable for this extraordinary patient category. METHODS: We retrospectively compared the physical recovery of COVID-19 and non-COVID pneumosepsis ICU survivors between ICU- and hospital discharge, defined as the difference in performance on the Medical Research Council Sum-Score (MRC-SS), Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment tool (CPAx), and percentage of predicted handgrip strength (POP-HGS). An ANCOVA model was built using age, sex, Barthel-index, BMI, admission APACHE-II score, adequacy of protein delivery during ICU stay and ward length of stay as covariates. RESULTS: 35 COVID-19 ICU patients could be compared to 21 non-COVID pneumosepsis ICU survivors. All patients scored </=48 on the MRC-SS at ICU discharge, indicating ICUAW. ICUAW had resolved in more COVID-19, than in non-COVID patients upon hospital discharge, although not significantly (52% vs. 22%, p = .081). When controlling for covariates, COVID-19 patients performed worse on all physical functioning assessments upon ICU discharge, but had improved more at hospital discharge on the MRC-SS (n(2) = 0.214, p = .002) and CPAx (n(2) = 0.153, p = .011). POP-HGS remained lower in COVID-19 patients throughout hospital stay. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 ICU-survivors are a vulnerable group concerning ICUAW, but they show better tendency towards physical rehabilitation than non-COVID pneumosepsis ICU-survivors during the post-ICU hospitalization period regarding MRC-SS and CPAx. COVID-19 ICU patients might benefit from early, more intensive physical therapy. CLINICAL RELEVANCY STATEMENT: COVID-19 ICU survivors are at high risk for ICU-acquired weakness, which is well known to have immense personal and societal consequences. As the group of COVID-19 ICU survivors is quickly growing world-wide, insight into their requirements for optimal physical rehabilitation and methods of assessing these is of paramount importance.

34133354	Calcium channel blockers improve prognosis of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and hypertension. BACKGROUND: Hypertension is considered an important risk factor for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The commonly anti-hypertensive drugs are the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and beta-blockers. The association between commonly used anti-hypertensive medications and the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients with hypertension has not been well studied. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included all patients admitted with COVID-19 to Huo Shen Shan Hospital and Guanggu District of the Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China. Clinical and laboratory characteristics were extracted from electronic medical records. Hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatment were confirmed by medical history and clinical records. The primary clinical endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included the rates of patients in common wards transferred to the intensive care unit and hospital stay duration. Logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors associated with mortality and prognosis. Propensity score matching was used to balance the confounders between different anti-hypertensive treatments. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare the cumulative recovery rate. Log-rank tests were performed to test for differences in Kaplan-Meier curves between different groups. RESULTS: Among 4569 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 31.7% (1449/4569) had a history of hypertension. There were significant differences in mortality rates between hypertensive patients with CCBs (7/359) and those without (21/359) (1.95% vs. 5.85%, risk ratio [RR]: 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.76, chi2 = 7.61, P = 0.0058). After matching for confounders, the mortality rates were similar between the RAAS inhibitor (4/236) and non-RAAS inhibitor (9/236) cohorts (1.69% vs. 3.81%, RR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.13-1.43, chi2 = 1.98, P = 0.1596). Hypertensive patients with beta-blockers (13/340) showed no statistical difference in mortality compared with those without (11/340) (3.82% vs. 3.24%, RR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.53-2.69, chi2 = 0.17, P = 0.6777). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we did not find any positive or negative effects of RAAS inhibitors or beta-blockers in COVID-19 patients with hypertension, while CCBs could improve prognosis.

34224944	Evaluation of 2 commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in an immunocompetent and immunocompromised inpatient population with COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread introduction of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was introduced without a full understanding of the assays performance or the antibody kinetics following infection with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We performed an evaluation of 2 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays with a more detailed look into the effect of immune status on antibody sensitivity. RESULTS: Both assays demonstrated 100% specificity. The overall sensitivity of the Roche was 92.1% at >/=14 days and 94.8% at >/=21 days, and the overall sensitivity of the Abbott was 94.4% at >/=14 days and 98.2% at >/=21 days. 7/41 (17%) of patients included in this cohort were immunocompromised. Seroconversion was seen less commonly in the immunocompromised (4/7 [57.1%] seroconverted) and after excluding these patients 100% sensitivity was seen in both assays at >/=21 days. DISCUSSION: Performance of both assays in the immunocompetent appeared excellent after 21 days postsymptom onset. Both assays are highly specific.	Diagnosis
34213308	Site-Specific Steric Control of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycosylation. A central tenet in the design of vaccines is the display of native-like antigens in the elicitation of protective immunity. The abundance of N-linked glycans across the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a potential source of heterogeneity among the many different vaccine candidates under investigation. Here, we investigate the glycosylation of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins from five different laboratories and compare them against S protein from infectious virus, cultured in Vero cells. We find patterns that are conserved across all samples, and this can be associated with site-specific stalling of glycan maturation that acts as a highly sensitive reporter of protein structure. Molecular dynamics simulations of a fully glycosylated spike support a model of steric restrictions that shape enzymatic processing of the glycans. These results suggest that recombinant spike-based SARS-CoV-2 immunogen glycosylation reproducibly recapitulates signatures of viral glycosylation.	Mechanism;Treatment

This paper develops a scale that measures the perceived service quality of hospitals during a pandemic. To develop the scale, data from 206 respondents from India, was subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The newly developed scale was named PAND-SERVQUAL, which includes factors namely, assistance, facility & layout, trust, empathy, promptness, and knowledge. The resulting scale is likely to be useful for researchers exploring service quality research and health care quality as well. Findings will facilitate understanding patient's expectations regarding the service quality of hospitals during a pandemic.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/00185868.2021.1939827 .

34281004	Changes in Health Behaviors, Mental and Physical Health among Older Adults under Severe Lockdown Restrictions during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain. We used data from 3041 participants in four cohorts of community-dwelling individuals aged >/=65 years in Spain collected through a pre-pandemic face-to-face interview and a telephone interview conducted between weeks 7 to 15 after the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown. On average, the confinement was not associated with a deterioration in lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol intake, diet, or weight), except for a decreased physical activity and increased sedentary time, which reversed with the end of confinement. However, chronic pain worsened, and moderate declines in mental health, that did not seem to reverse after restrictions were lifted, were observed. Males, older adults with greater social isolation or greater feelings of loneliness, those with poorer housing conditions, as well as those with a higher prevalence of chronic morbidities were at increased risk of developing unhealthier lifestyles or mental health declines with confinement. On the other hand, previously having a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and doing more physical activity protected older adults from developing unhealthier lifestyles with confinement. If another lockdown were imposed during this or future pandemics, public health programs should specially address the needs of older individuals with male sex, greater social isolation, sub-optimal housing conditions, and chronic morbidities because of their greater vulnerability to the enacted movement restrictions.

34282628	Evaluation of index of cardiac electrophysiological balance in COVID-19 patients. AIM: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the index of Cardiac Electrophysiological Balance (iCEB) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving Hydroxychloroquine / azithromycin (HCQ / AZ) combination therapy to determine the susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia among these patients. METHOD: Sixty-seven COVID-19 patients admitted to the ward were included in the study. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained from all patients before the initiation of treatment and on treatment day 5. QT/QRS (iCEB) and QTc/QRS (iCEBc) ratios were calculated. RESULTS: QRS, QT and QTc intervals were significantly prolonged on day 5 measurements compared to pre-treatment period (p <0.05). Overall, mean iCEB was 3.6+/-0.4 before treatment and 3.8+/-0.4 on day 5 in the study population (p <0.001). Considering the iCEBc values, a significant increase was observed in patients receiving HCQ/AZ treatment compared to pre-treatment period (4.1+/-0.5 vs 4.4+/-0.6; p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate iCEB and iCEBc parameters in patients with COVID-19 on HCQ/AZ therapy. In this study, we demonstrated significantly increased iCEB and iCEBc values following HCQ/AZ treatment in COVID-19 patients. iCEB and iCEBc may serve as a noninvasive, simple, and novel biomarker for detecting increased pro-arrhythmia risk in COVID-19 patients (Tab. 3, Fig. 3, Ref. 36).

34215210	Ivermectin to prevent hospitalizations in patients with COVID-19 (IVERCOR-COVID19) a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has changed our lives. The scientific community has been investigating re-purposed treatments to prevent disease progression in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ivermectin treatment can prevent hospitalization in individuals with early COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in non-hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 in Corrientes, Argentina. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive nasal swabs were contacted within 48 h by telephone to invite them to participate. The trial randomized 501 patients between August 19th 2020 and February 22nd 2021. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to ivermectin (N = 250) or placebo (N = 251) arms in a staggered dose, according to the patient's weight, for 2 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The efficacy of ivermectin to prevent hospitalizations was evaluated as primary outcome. We evaluated secondary outcomes in relationship to safety and other efficacy end points. RESULTS: The mean age was 42 years (SD +/- 15.5) and the median time since symptom onset to the inclusion was 4 days [interquartile range 3-6]. The primary outcome of hospitalization was met in 14/250 (5.6%) individuals in ivermectin group and 21/251 (8.4%) in placebo group (odds ratio 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-1.31; p = 0.227). Time to hospitalization was not statistically different between groups. The mean time from study enrollment to invasive mechanical ventilatory support (MVS) was 5.25 days (SD +/- 1.71) in ivermectin group and 10 days (SD +/- 2) in placebo group, (p = 0.019). There were no statistically significant differences in the other secondary outcomes including polymerase chain reaction test negativity and safety outcomes. LIMITATIONS: Low percentage of hospitalization events, dose of ivermectin and not including only high-risk population. CONCLUSION: Ivermectin had no significant effect on preventing hospitalization of patients with COVID-19. Patients who received ivermectin required invasive MVS earlier in their treatment. No significant differences were observed in any of the other secondary outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04529525 .	Treatment
34292208	Modifications of intravitreal injections in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to the normal operation of the healthcare system. On a worldwide scale, hospitals suspended non-urgent surgeries and outpatient visits to downsized clinical loadings to redistribute manpower to counteract the pandemic's impact. So far, there is no evidence-based guideline defining a clear line between urgent and non-urgent indications of intravitreal injections (IVI). Herein, we aimed to summarize IVI algorithm modifications and discuss the patient prioritization according to medical needs in the hostile environment in the COVID crisis. Assessing current literature, we found that neovascular age-related macular degeneration is considered the utmost priority among conditions that require IVI. Other conditions assigned with a high priority include monocular or quasi-monocular patients (only one eye > 20/40), neovascular glaucoma, and new patients with significant vision loss. Although patients with central retinal vein occlusion and proliferative diabetic retinopathy are not advised to delay treatments, we found no consistent evidence that correlated with a worse outcome. Diabetic macular edema and branched retinal vein occlusion patients undertaking treatment delay should be regularly followed up every 2-3 months. Serving as the principle of management behind the algorithm modifications, the reduction of both patient visit and IVI therapy counts should be reckoned together with the risk of permanent visual loss and COVID infection.

34352787	Cerebrovascular Accident and SARS-CoV-19 (COVID-19): A Systematic Review. BACKGROUND: While the most common neurologic symptoms reported in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 are headache, dizziness, myalgia, mental fog, and anosmia, there is a growing basis of published peer-reviewed cases reporting stroke in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The peer-reviewed literature suggests an increased risk of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in the setting of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We searched 3 databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, and CINAHL) with search terms COVID-19, novel coronavirus, stroke, and cerebrovascular accident. Case series and case studies presenting patients positive for both COVID-19 and CVA published from January 1 through September 1, 2020, were included. Data collection and analysis was completed and risk of bias assessed. RESULTS: The search identified 28 studies across 7 counties comprising 73 patients. Amongst patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection and CVA, the average age was 60; the most common preexisting conditions were hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and those without preexisting conditions were significantly younger with an average age of 47. Amongst hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and CVA, there was a bimodal association with COVID-19 infection severity with majority of patients classified with mild or critical COVID-19 infection. DISCUSSION: The data suggest SARS-CoV-2 is a risk factor for developing stroke, particularly in patients with hypertension and diabetes. Furthermore, the younger average age of stroke in patients with SARS-CoV-2, particularly those patients with zero identifiable preexisting conditions, creates high suspicion that SARS-CoV-2 is an independent risk factor for development of stroke; however, this cannot yet be proven without comparable control population. The data suggest the risk of developing CVA in the setting of COVID-19 infection is not dependent upon severity of illness. Continued studies must be done to understand the epidemiologic factors of COVID-19 infection and stroke and the pathophysiology of the COVID-associated hypercoagulable state.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34283338	Low neutralizing antibody responses in WM, CLL and NHL patients after the first dose of the BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccine. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is considered as the most important preventive strategy against COVID-19, but its efficacy in patients with hematological malignancies is largely unknown. We investigated the development of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). After the first dose of the vaccine, on D22, WM/CLL/NHL patients had lower NAb titers compared to controls: the median NAb inhibition titer was 17% (range 0-91%, IQR 8-27%) for WM/CLL/NHL patients versus 32% (range 2-98%, IQR 19-48%) for controls (P < 0.001). Only 8 (14%) patients versus 114 (54%) controls developed NAb titers >/= 30% on D22 (p < 0.001). Our data indicate that the first dose of both BNT162b2 and AZD1222 leads to lower production of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with WM/CLL/NHL compared to controls of similar age and gender and without malignant disease. Even though the response rates were not optimal, vaccination is still considered essential and if possible should be performed before treatment initiation. These patients with suboptimal responses should be considered to be prioritized for booster doses.	Treatment
34211001	Wisdom of crowds detects COVID-19 severity ahead of officially available data. During the unfolding of a crisis, it is crucial to forecast its severity at an early stage , yet access to reliable data is often challenging early on. The wisdom of crowds has been effective at forecasting in similar scenarios. We investigated whether the initial regional social media reaction to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in three critically affected countries has significant relations with their observed mortality a month later. We obtained COVID-19 related regionally geolocated tweets from Italian, Spanish, and United States regions. We quantified the predictive power of the wisdom of the crowds using correlations and regressions of geolocated Tweet Intensity (TI) during the initial social media attention peak versus the cumulative number of deaths a month ahead. We found that the intensity of initial COVID-19 related tweet attention at the beginning of the pandemic across Italian, Spanish, and United States regions is significantly related (p < 0.001) to the extent to which these regions had been affected by the pandemic a month later. This association is most striking in Italy as when at its peak of TI in late February 2020 only two of its regions had reported mortality. The collective wisdom of the crowds at early stages of the pandemic, when information on the number of infections was not broadly available, strikingly predicted the extent of mortality reflecting the regional severity of the pandemic almost a month later. Our findings could underpin the creation of real-time novelty detection systems aimed at early reporting of the severity of crises impacting a territory leading to early activation of control measures at a stage when available data is extremely limited.

34285203	Fully automated fast-flow synthesis of antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers. Rapid development of antisense therapies can enable on-demand responses to new viral pathogens and make personalized medicine for genetic diseases practical. Antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) are promising candidates to fill such a role, but their challenging synthesis limits their widespread application. To rapidly prototype potential PMO drug candidates, we report a fully automated flow-based oligonucleotide synthesizer. Our optimized synthesis platform reduces coupling times by up to 22-fold compared to previously reported methods. We demonstrate the power of our automated technology with the synthesis of milligram quantities of three candidate therapeutic PMO sequences for an unserved class of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). To further test our platform, we synthesize a PMO that targets the genomic mRNA of SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate its antiviral effects. This platform could find broad application not only in designing new SARS-CoV-2 and DMD antisense therapeutics, but also for rapid development of PMO candidates to treat new and emerging diseases.

(1) Background: Patients suffering from the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease could experience several extra-pulmonary involvements, including cardiovascular complications and liver injury. This study aims to evaluate the presence of cardiac and liver alterations in patients with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and liver elastography (LE). (2) Methods: A total of 97 subjects recovering from COVID-19, attending the hospital's specialized outpatient clinic for persisting symptoms at 3 to 11 weeks after the acute illness, were included in this study. They all had a basal COVID-19 assessment, and subsequently, a clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, TTE, and LE. (3) Results: considering the presence of pulmonary injury during COVID-19, patients were divided into two groups. Although none of them had altered systolic function, we evidenced pulmonary hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, increased liver stiffness, viscosity, and steatosis in around one-third of the patients, with significantly higher values in subjects with pulmonary injury compared to those without. (4) Conclusion: persisting symptoms characterizing the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome could be explained by residual cardiac and hepatic lesions, which were worse in more severe COVID-19 forms. These patients may be at risk of developing liver fibrosis and cardiac alterations and should be investigated in the first 12 weeks after the onset of the infection.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34221065	Depinar, a drug that potentially inhibits the binding and entry of COVID-19 into host cells based on computer-aided studies. Background and purpose: The new coronavirus (Covid-19) has resulted in great global concerns. Due to the mortality of this virus, scientists from all over the world have been trying to employ different strategies to tackle down this concern. This virus enters cells via phagocytosis through binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor. After invading the body, it can stay hidden in there for a period of up to 24 days (incubation period). Experimental approach: In this report, by the use of in silico studies we selected several FDA-approved compounds that possess antiviral properties. We chose the viral Spike protein as the target of drug compounds and carried out the screening process for the FDA databank in order to find the most effective ligand. Findings/Results: The results from dock and MD revealed 10 compounds with high affinity to the receptor-binding domain motif of S protein. The best inhibitors were the ingredients of Depinar, which managed to effectively block the interactions between cells and virus. Conclusion and implication: The results of this study were approved by in silico studies and due to the lack of time; we did not test the efficiency of these compounds through in vitro and in vivo studies. However, the selected compounds are all FDA approved and some are supplements like vitamin B12 and don't cause any side effects for patients.	Mechanism;Treatment
34211521	Alprostadil associated with low molecular weight heparin to treat limb ischemia caused by SARS-CoV2. The current coronavirus pandemic has already taken a great toll globally, causing massive morbidity and mortality. One of its severe forms is a thrombophilic state that can damage several systems. This article reports the case of 60-year-old female patient who presented with mild flu symptoms, which turned out to be a SARS-CoV2 infection, and ended up developing arterial thrombosis with limb ischemia in a private care hospital in Sorocaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Considering this progression, we decided to intervene with low molecular weight heparin and Alprostadil, achieving a good clinical outcome. Our description aims to identify key points and clinical signs that offer evidence of the therapeutic window and a treatment option for coagulatory presentations of COVID-19.	Case Report
34221365	A quasi-experimental study on the effect of health and food safety training intervention on restaurant food handlers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The restaurant business has turned into a dynamic and ever-growing industry. So, food safety must be a priority for these establishments, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of training intervention on the health and food safety knowledge, attitude, and self-reported practice (KAP) of restaurant food handlers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 159 restaurant food handlers in Tehran, Iran. The training intervention was developed based on the latest global guidelines. The KAP of the subjects was measured before and after the training. Fisher's exact test, paired t test, and repeated measures ANOVA were used for statistical analysis. Data analysis was done using the IBM_SPSS software. The total knowledge scores of participants were low (17.6%), moderate (35.2%), and good (47.2%) before training, which were changed to 5% (low), 23.9% (moderate), and 71.1% (good) after training. The total pretraining attitude scores were 0.6, 77.4, 18.2, and 3.8% that were changed to 0% (strongly negative), 49.1% (negative), 33.3% (positive), and 17.6% (strongly positive), respectively. Also, the self-reported practice scores of the participants before training were 1.3, 56, and 42.7 that were changed to 0% (weak), 26.4% (acceptable), and 73.6% (desirable) after the intervention, respectively. Paired t test results showed a statistically significant increase in all scores. The interaction of training with age and education was statistically significant in increasing the knowledge and attitude scores of the participants by the repeated measures ANOVA. Improving the KAP of food handlers by health and food safety training can improve the status of restaurants and minimize the outbreak of pandemic diseases, including COVID-19, which is an effective step in community health. Thus, it is an urgent need for policymakers to design an online system of continuous food safety training for food handlers.	Prevention
34287813	Mortality risk factors in a Spanish cohort of oldest-old patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in an acute geriatric unit: the OCTA-COVID study. PURPOSE: To determine predictors of in-hospital mortality related to COVID-19 in oldest-old patients. DESIGN: Single-center observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients >/= 75 years admitted to an Acute Geriatric Unit with COVID-19. METHODS: Data from hospital admission were retrieved from the electronic medical records: demographics, geriatric syndromes (delirium, falls, polypharmacy, functional and cognitive status) co-morbidities, previous treatments, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic characteristics. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Three hundred patients were consecutively included (62.7% females, mean age of 86.3 +/- 6.6 years). Barthel Index (BI) was < 60 in 127 patients (42.8%) and 126 (42.0%) had Charlson Index CI >/= 3. Most patients (216; 72.7%) were frail (Clinical Frailty Scale >/= 5) and 134 patients (45.1%) had dementia of some degree. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 37%. The following factors were associated with higher in-hospital mortality in a multi-variant analysis: CURB-65 score = 3-5 (HR 7.99, 95% CI 3.55-19.96, p < 0.001), incident delirium (HR 1.72, 1.10-2.70, p = 0.017) and dementia (HR 3.01, 95% CI 1.37-6.705, p = 0.017). Protective factors were concurrent use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.25-0.72, p = 0.002) or prescription of hydroxychloroquine (HC 0.37 95% CI 0.22-0.62, p < 0.001) treatment during admission. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that recognition of geriatric syndromes together with the CURB-65 score may be useful tools to help clinicians establish the prognosis of oldest-old patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

34133816	ECMM/ISHAM recommendations for clinical management of COVID-19 associated mucormycosis in low- and middle-income countries. Reports are increasing on the emergence of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) globally, driven particularly by low- and middle-income countries. The recent unprecedented surge of CAM in India has drawn worldwide attention. More than 28,252 mucormycosis cases are counted and India is the first country where mucormycosis has been declared a notifiable disease. However, misconception of management, diagnosing and treating this infection continue to occur. Thus, European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) and the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) felt the need to address clinical management of CAM in low- and middle-income countries. This article provides a comprehensive document to help clinicians in managing this infection. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and inappropriate (high dose or not indicated) corticosteroid use are the major predisposing factors for this surge. High counts of Mucorales spores in both the indoor and outdoor environments, and the immunosuppressive impact of COVID-19 patients as well as immunotherapy are possible additional factors. Furthermore, a hyperglycaemic state leads to an increased expression of glucose regulated protein (GRP- 78) in endothelial cells that may help the entry of Mucorales into tissues. Rhino-orbital mucormycosis is the most common presentation followed by pulmonary mucormycosis. Recommendations are focused on the early suspicion of the disease and confirmation of diagnosis. Regarding management, glycaemic control, elimination of corticosteroid therapy, extensive surgical debridement and antifungal therapy are the standards for proper care. Due to limited availability of amphotericin B formulations during the present epidemic, alternative antifungal therapies are also discussed.	Diagnosis;Treatment;Prevention
34367780	Two Cases of Post-Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Encephalopathy Associated With Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections can cause many complications, including central nervous system (CNS) complications. One of the most common COVID-19 CNS complications is COVID-19 encephalopathy, a disorder characterized by cognitive impairment, altered consciousness, and even seizures. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is a recently approved mRNA-based vaccine aimed at preventing COVID-19 infections and their complications. Here, we describe two patients with no known neurological or psychiatric history who presented with encephalopathy and seizures that began after part one of their Moderna COVID-19 vaccine series. To our knowledge, there are no other reports of post-Moderna COVID-19 vaccine encephalopathy in the literature. We suggest a mechanism for this complication and thoroughly discuss why the Moderna vaccine is possibly responsible, by addressing confounders in our patients.	Case Report
34217420	Early assessment of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer screening services: The International Cancer Screening Network COVID-19 survey. Screening can decrease the burden of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. The COVID-19 pandemic led many countries to suspend cancer screening services as part of their response to the pandemic. The International Cancer Screening Network (ICSN) carried out an online survey to assess the effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer screening. A 33-item survey was distributed to 834 email addresses to gather information about settings and assess decision-making processes that led to cancer screening suspension. Information about communication, impact on resources, and patient follow-up was collected. Quantitative data was analyzed as frequencies overall and by setting, while a comment section under each survey item captured nuanced details. Responses were recategorized into 66 settings, representing 35 countries. Most settings suspended cancer screening services (n = 60, 90.9%) in March 2020 (n = 45, 68.2%), guided by a government decision (n = 51, 77.3%). Few settings made the decision whether to suspend services based on a preparedness plan (n = 17, 25.8%). In most settings, professionals were reassigned (n = 41, 62.1%) and infrastructure repurposed (n = 35, 53.0%). The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on cancer screening worldwide, including the suspension of services in almost all settings. Most settings were unprepared to deal with the scale of the pandemic but demonstrated flexibility in the response. These results contribute to inform, through experiences and lessons learned, the next steps for the global cancer screening community to further evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and prepare for future disruptions.

34288966	"Coronary artery calcification on low-dose chest CT is an early predictor of severe progression of COVID-19-A multi-center, multi-vendor study. PURPOSE: Cardiovascular comorbidity anticipates severe progression of COVID-19 and becomes evident by coronary artery calcification (CAC) on low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT). The purpose of this study was to predict a patient's obligation of intensive care treatment by evaluating the coronary calcium burden on the initial diagnostic LDCT. METHODS: Eighty-nine consecutive patients with parallel LDCT and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were included from three centers. The primary endpoint was admission to ICU, tracheal intubation, or death in the 22-day follow-up period. CAC burden was represented by the Agatston score. Multivariate logistic regression was modeled for prediction of the primary endpoint by the independent variables ""Agatston score > 0"", as well as the CT lung involvement score, patient sex, age, clinical predictors of severe COVID-19 progression (history of hypertension, diabetes, prior cardiovascular event, active smoking, or hyperlipidemia), and laboratory parameters (creatinine, C-reactive protein, leucocyte, as well as thrombocyte counts, relative lymphocyte count, d-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase levels). RESULTS: After excluding multicollinearity, ""Agatston score >0"" was an independent regressor within multivariate analysis for prediction of the primary endpoint (p<0.01). Further independent regressors were creatinine (p = 0.02) and leucocyte count (p = 0.04). The Agatston score was significantly higher for COVID-19 cases which completed the primary endpoint (64.2 [interquartile range 1.7-409.4] vs. 0 [interquartile range 0-0]). CONCLUSION: CAC scoring on LDCT might help to predict future obligation of intensive care treatment at the day of patient admission to the hospital."	Diagnosis;Treatment
34205311	Agricultural Stakeholders' Perceptions of Occupational Health and Safety in the Southeastern U.S. Coastal States. Agriculture remains a highly dangerous industry for occupational health and safety. This study sought to understand the perspective of agricultural professionals with respect to the current state of the industry, challenges, and opportunities relevant to occupational health and safety. Additional questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in the findings as well. Eleven industry professionals were interviewed, and the transcripts were qualitatively analyzed for emergent themes following a constant comparative method. Three themes emerged in our findings: a description of the current state of occupational health and safety in the agricultural industry, barriers to improving occupational health and safety, and enablers of occupational health and safety. Each theme contained subthemes. The description of the industry encompassed regulations, inherent danger, and attitudes and education. Barriers included education, health care access, logistics, discrimination and cultural competency, economic considerations, and the labor contracting system. Enablers included education, regulations, and health care and prevention. These findings are consistent with existing literature, revealing interconnected and overlapping challenges and opportunities. Further research is recommended with a broader sample of participants, especially farmworkers.	Prevention
34226622	Understanding protection from SARS-CoV-2 using metabolomics. The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging in most countries. Although the recent mass vaccination campaign has opened a new chapter in the battle against SARS-CoV-2, the world is still far from herd immunity. There is an urgent need to identify healthy people at high risk of contracting COVID-19, as well as supplements and nutraceuticals that can reduce the risk of infection or mitigate symptoms. In the present study, a metabolic phenotype that could protect individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection or predispose them to developing COVID-19 was investigated. Untargeted metabolomics was performed on serum samples collected from 51 healthcare workers who were in good health at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, and who were later exposed to the same risk of developing COVID-19. Half of them developed COVID-19 within three weeks of the blood collection. Our results demonstrate the presence of a specific signature associated with protection from SARS-CoV-2. Circulating monolaurin, which has well-known antiviral and antibacterial properties, was higher in protected subjects, suggesting a potential defensive role against SARS-CoV-2 infection; thus, dietary supplements could boost the immune system against this infection. In addition, our data demonstrate that people with higher levels of cholesterol are at higher risk of developing COVID-19. The present study demonstrates that metabolomics can be of great help for developing personalized medicine and for supporting public healthcare strategies. Studies with larger cohorts of subjects are necessary to confirm our findings.	Mechanism;Treatment
34214738	Safety and Immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in Patients after Allogeneic HCT or CD19-based CART therapy-A Single-Center Prospective Cohort Study. Data are scarce regarding both the safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients undergoing immune cell therapy; thus, we prospectively evaluated these two domains in patients receiving this vaccine after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT; n = 66) or after CD19-based chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CART) therapy (n = 14). Overall, the vaccine was well tolerated, with mild non-hematologic vaccine-reported adverse events in a minority of the patients. Twelve percent of the patients after the first dose and 10% of the patients after the second dose developed cytopenia, and there were three cases of graft-versus-host disease exacerbation after each dose. A single case of impending graft rejection was summarized as possibly related. Evaluation of immunogenicity showed that 57% of patients after CART infusion and 75% patients after allogeneic HCT had evidence of humoral and/or cellular response to the vaccine. The Cox regression model indicated that longer time from infusion of cells, female sex, and higher CD19(+) cells were associated with a positive humoral response, whereas a higher CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio was correlated with a positive cellular response, as confirmed by the ELISpot test. We conclude that the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has impressive immunogenicity in patients after allogeneic HCT or CART. Adverse events were mostly mild and transient, but some significant hematologic events were observed; hence, patients should be closely monitored.	Treatment

Moreover, it provides an organizational model for patient preparation and describes the patient pathways in the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative periods. It also describes safety rules for elective surgery and a model for monitoring patients after discharge according to scientific evidence.	Prevention
34282607	Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on Medical Use of Military Hospitals in Korea. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began in December 2019. While it has not yet ended, COVID-19 has already created transitions in health care, one of which is a decrease in medical use for health-related issues other than COVID-19 infection. Korean soldiers are relatively homogeneous in terms of age and physical condition. They show a similar disease distribution pattern every year and are directly affected by changes in government attempts to control COVID-19 with nonpharmaceutical interventions. This study aimed to identify the changes in patterns of outpatient visits and admissions to military hospitals for a range of disease types during a pandemic. METHODS: Outpatient attendance and admission data from all military hospitals in South Korea from January 2016 to December 2020 were analyzed. Only active enlisted soldiers aged 18-32 years were included. Outpatient visits where there was a diagnosis of pneumonia, acute upper respiratory tract infection, infectious conjunctivitis, infectious enteritis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and fractures were analyzed. Admissions for pneumonia, acute enteritis, and fractures were also analyzed. All outpatient visits and admissions in 2020 for each disease were counted on a weekly basis and compared with the average number of visits over the same period of each year from 2016 to 2019. The corrected value was calculated by dividing the ratio of total weekly number of outpatient visits or admissions to the corresponding medical department in 2020 to the average in 2016-2019. RESULTS: A total of 5,813,304 cases of outpatient care and 143,022 cases of admission were analyzed. For pneumonia, the observed and corrected numbers of outpatient visits and admissions in 2020 decreased significantly compared with the average of other years (P < 0.001). The results were similar for outpatient visits for acute upper respiratory tract infection and infectious conjunctivitis (P < 0.001), while the corrected number of outpatient visits for infectious enteritis showed a significant increase in 2020 (P = 0.005). The corrected number of outpatient visits for asthma in 2020 did not differ from the average of the previous 4 years but the number of visits for the other allergic diseases increased significantly (P < 0.001). For fractures, the observed and corrected numbers of outpatient visits and admissions in 2020 decreased significantly compared with the average of other years (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatient visits to military hospitals for respiratory and conjunctival infections and fractures decreased, whereas visits for allergic diseases did not change or increased only slightly. Admissions for pneumonia decreased significantly in 2020, while those for acute enteritis and fractures also decreased, but showed an increased proportion compared with previous years. These results are important because they illustrate the changing patterns in lifestyle as a result of public encouragement to adopt nonpharmaceutical interventions during the pandemic and their effect on medical needs for both infectious and noninfectious diseases in a select group.

34287384	High Effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines in Reducing COVID-19-Related Deaths in over 75-Year-Olds, Ceara State, Brazil. In Brazil, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination program has so far prioritized people over 75 years of age. By the end of March 2021, in Ceara State, a total of 313,328 elderly people had received at least one dose of vaccine (45% Oxford-AstraZeneca/Fiocruz and 55% CoronaVac-Sinovac/Butantan), and 159,970 had received two doses (83% CoronaVac-Sinovac/Butantan and 17% Oxford-AstraZeneca/Fiocruz). After a single dose, there was already a significant reduction in COVID 19-related deaths (protection ratio: 19.31 (95% CI: 18.20-20.48), attributable protection ratio: 94.8%); higher protection ratios were observed after the application of two doses of the vaccine (132.67; 95% CI: 109.88-160.18), with an attributable protection ratio of 99.2%. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are highly effective in reducing the number of COVID-19-related deaths in over 75-year-olds in Brazil, one of the hardest hit countries by the current pandemic.	Treatment

One year after the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), referrals for persistent headache, often defined as ""post-COVID headache,"" have become increasingly common in outpatient headache clinics. However, it is important to take into consideration that this term may include a spectrum of clinically different headache types. We describe three cases of migraine-like headaches in individuals with a history of mild COVID-19 infection to demonstrate some of the different phenotypes of persistent headaches seen. These cases highlight the importance of a careful evaluation when assessing the complexities of ""post-COVID headache"" as well as the need to further investigate the different, underlying, pathophysiological mechanisms."

34332823	Coronavirus Disease 2019-Induced Thyroiditis. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease that presents with acute respiratory symptoms that are well documented and sequelae that are yet to be fully understood. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 51-year old woman, recently diagnosed with COVID-19, who presented with symptoms including chest pain, palpitations, difficulty swallowing, and anterior neck discomfort. We ultimately diagnosed her with COVID-19-induced thyroiditis and discharged her on propranolol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Thyroiditis can present with symptoms similar to other etiologies like pulmonary embolism. We discuss the process of evaluating and treating thyroiditis. We further discuss the risk of administering iodinated contrast media that could further exacerbate thyroid dysfunction.	Case Report
34219952	Longitudinal evaluation for COVID-19 chest CT disease progression based on Tchebichef moments. Blur is a key property in the perception of COVID-19 computed tomography (CT) image manifestations. Typically, blur causes edge extension, which brings shape changes in infection regions. Tchebichef moments (TM) have been verified efficiently in shape representation. Intuitively, disease progression of same patient over time during the treatment is represented as different blur degrees of infection regions, since different blur degrees cause the magnitudes change of TM on infection regions image, blur of infection regions can be captured by TM. With the above observation, a longitudinal objective quantitative evaluation method for COVID-19 disease progression based on TM is proposed. COVID-19 disease progression CT image database (COVID-19 DPID) is built to employ radiologist subjective ratings and manual contouring, which can test and compare disease progression on the CT images acquired from the same patient over time. Then the images are preprocessed, including lung automatic segmentation, longitudinal registration, slice fusion, and a fused slice image with region of interest (ROI) is obtained. Next, the gradient of a fused ROI image is calculated to represent the shape. The gradient image of fused ROI is separated into same size blocks, a block energy is calculated as quadratic sum of non-direct current moment values. Finally, the objective assessment score is obtained by TM energy-normalized applying block variances. We have conducted experiment on COVID-19 DPID and the experiment results indicate that our proposed metric supplies a satisfactory correlation with subjective evaluation scores, demonstrating effectiveness in the quantitative evaluation for COVID-19 disease progression.

34369601	Outcomes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in influenza versus COVID-19 during the first wave of COVID-19. PURPOSE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a refractory treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]). We conducted this study to compare the outcomes of influenza patients treated with veno-venous-ECMO (VV-ECMO) to COVID-19 patients treated with VV-ECMO, during the first wave of COVID-19. METHODS: Patients in our institution with ARDS due to COVID-19 or influenza who were placed on ECMO between August 1, 2010 and September 15, 2020 were included in this comparative, retrospective study. To improve homogeneity, only VV-ECMO patients were analyzed. The clinical characteristics and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 28 COVID-19 patients and 17 influenza patients were identified and included. ECMO survival rates were 68% (19/28) in COVID-19 patients and 94% (16/17) in influenza patients (p = .04). Thirty days survival rates after ECMO decannulation were 54% (15/28) in COVID-19 patients and 76% (13/17) in influenza patients (p = .13). COVID-19 patients spent a longer time on ECMO compared to flu patients (21 vs. 12 days; p = .025), and more COVID-19 patients (26/28 vs. 2/17) were on immunomodulatory therapy before ECMO initiation (p < .001). COVID-19 patients had higher rates of new infections during ECMO (50% vs. 18%; p = .03) and bacterial pneumonia (36% vs. 6%; p = .024). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients who were treated in our institution with VV-ECMO had statistically lower ECMO survival rates than influenza patients. It is possible that COVID-19 immunomodulation therapies may increase the risk of other superimposed infections.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34286221	Family Medicine Residents' Experience During Early Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Background and Objectives: Residents have been thrust onto the front lines of the US medical response to COVID-19. This study aimed to quantify and describe the experiences of family medicine residents nationally during the early phases of the pandemic. Specific areas of interest included training received and the residents' personal sense of safety. The purpose of this study was to look for differences among residents based on geographic location. Method: This May 2020 survey was conducted by the Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) of a random sample of 5,000 resident members of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). Results: The overall response rate for the survey was 5.66% (283/5,000). More than 40% of residents reported having felt in moderate to significant personal danger during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fewer than 20% had been tested for COVID-19 themselves. Among all respondents, 176 (65.7%) of the residents had provided direct patient care for COVID-19-positive patients. Most had been trained on personal protective equipment and the medical aspects of COVID-19, but 16.2% reported no training on how to care for COVID-19 patients. Minority residents, and residents in larger urban areas were less likely to receive timely training. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on family medicine residents' medical education and their sense of safety. Regional variations in residents' educational experiences during the pandemic exist. Training prior to COVID-19 exposure was not universal. In our sample, minority residents were less likely to receive timely training than White residents.	Prevention
34346049	COVID-19 pandemic year in a sample of Polish myasthenia gravis patients: an observational study. AIM OF THE STUDY: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence, mortality, recovery and hospitalisation rates vary in different countries. This study aimed to present the clinical characteristics of a sample of unvaccinated Polish myasthenia gravis (MG) patients during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, taking into account the number of MG exacerbations, a detailed description of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection course, and the need to modify immunosuppressive therapies. Clinical rationale for the study: To assess the impact of the first COVID-19 pandemic year on MG course in a sample of unvaccinated patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study involving 30 unvaccinated Polish MG patients consulted in a neurological outpatient clinic on 11-31 March, 2020 (baseline) and 11-31 March, 2021 (endpoint). RESULTS: During the period of evaluation, exacerbation of MG requiring hospitalisation was reported in 11 patients. Among them, four were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and another six required plasma exchange. In the study group, COVID-19 was identified in 10 patients. Of them, seven experienced a mild course of SARSCoV-2 infection with spontaneous recovery. In the remaining three patients, both MG exacerbation and SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. These patients experienced MG exacerbation in the preceding month or concurrently with COVID-19 and were aged over 50 years. Due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, they required antibiotic and oxygen therapy, and hospitalisation was necessary in the case of two obese patients. None of the patients died due to COVID-19, and nor did any require discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapies during the study period. In total, 12 patients in the study group experienced neither MG exacerbation nor SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: In the presented sample of Polish MG patients, favourable outcomes of COVID-19 were observed. Further studies are needed to evaluate the reliable course of COVID-19 taking into account international differences, the types of treatment applied, and the ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated MG patients.

34217888	An innovative protocol for the artificial speech-directed, contactless administration of laboratory-based comprehensive cognitive assessments: PAAD-2 trial management during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in suspending in-person human subject research across most institutions in the US. Our extensive cognitive assessment for a phase-2 clinical trial, Physical Activity and Alzheimer's Disease-2 (PAAD-2), was also paused in March 2020. It was important to identify strategies to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission during our testing, which initially required substantial human speech and close person-to-person contact for test directions and instant feedback on paper/pencil tests. Given current understanding of the COVID-19 transmission, we dramatically adjusted the testing protocol to minimize the production of speech droplets and allow social distancing while maintaining the integrity of testing. We adopted state-of-the-art speech synthesis and computerization techniques to create an avatar to speak on behalf of the experimenter for all verbal instructions/feedback, used a document camera to observe the paper/pencil tests from the required distances, and automated the testing sequence and timing. This paper aims 1) to describe an innovative laboratory-based cognitive testing protocol for a completely contact-free, computer-speaking, and semi-automated administration; and 2) to evaluate the integrity of the modified protocol (n = 37) compared with the original protocol (n = 32). We have successfully operated the modified protocol since July 2020 with no evidence of COVID-19 transmission during testing, and data support that the modified protocol is robust and captures data identical to the original protocol. This transition of data collection methods has been critical during the pandemic and will be useful in future studies to mitigate the risk of contagious disease transmission and standardize laboratory-based psychological tests.

34201330	A Quantitative Benefit-Risk Analysis of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccine among People under 60 in Italy. The Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is a vaccine against the COVID-19 infection that was granted a conditional marketing authorization by the European Commission in January 2021. However, following a report from the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of European Medicines Agency, which reported an association with thrombo-embolic events (TEE), in particular disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), many European countries either limited it to individuals older than 55-60 years or suspended its use. We used publicly available data to carry out a quantitative benefit-risk analysis of the vaccine among people under 60 in Italy. Specifically, we used data from PRAC, Eudravigilance and ECDC to estimate the excess number of deaths for TEE, DIC and CVST expected in vaccine users, stratified by age groups. We then used data from the National Institute of Health to calculate age-specific COVID-19 mortality rates in Italy. Preventable deaths were calculated assuming a 72% vaccine efficacy over an eight-month period. Finally, the benefit-risk ratio of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination was calculated as the ratio of preventable COVID-19 deaths to vaccine-related deaths, using Monte-Carlo simulations. We found that among subjects aged 20-29 years the benefit-risk (B-R) ratio was not clearly favorable (0.70; 95% Uncertainty Interval (UI): 0.27-2.11). However, in the other age groups the benefits of vaccination largely exceeded the risks (for age 30-49, B-R ratio: 22.9: 95%UI: 10.1-186.4). For age 50-59, B-R ratio: 1577.1: 95%UI: 1176.9-2121.5). Although many countries have limited the use of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the benefits of using this vaccine clearly outweigh the risks in people older than 30 years. Study limitations included risk of underreporting and that we did not provide age-specific estimates. The use of this vaccine should be a strategic and fundamental part of the immunization campaign considering its safety and efficacy in preventing COVID-19 and its complications.	Treatment
34281793	Association of obesity with venous thromboembolism and myocardial injury in COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: Although both obesity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) independently induce inflammation and thrombosis, the association between obesity class and risk of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at a single institution. Patients were categorized based on obesity class. The main outcomes were venous thromboembolism (VTE) and myocardial injury, a marker of microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19. Adjustments were made for sociodemographic variables, cardiovascular disease risk factors and comorbidities. RESULTS: 609 patients with COVID-19 were included. 351 (58%) patients were without obesity, 110 (18%) were patients with class I obesity, 76 (12%) were patients with class II obesity, and 72 (12%) were patients with class III obesity. Patients with class I and III obesity had significantly higher risk-adjusted odds of VTE compared to patients without obesity (OR = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.05-6.14 for class I obesity; and OR = 3.95, 95% CI: 1.40-11.14 for class III obesity). Patients with class III obesity had significantly higher risk-adjusted odds of myocardial injury compared to patients without obesity (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.12-4.12). Both VTE and myocardial injury were significantly associated with greater risk-adjusted odds of mortality. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that both macrovascular and microvascular thromboses may contribute to the elevated morbidity and mortality in patients with obesity and COVID-19.

34345579	Mathematical model of COVID-19 in Nigeria with optimal control. The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by a new strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this work, we proposed a mathematical model of COVID-19. We carried out the qualitative analysis along with an epidemic indicator which is the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) of this model, stability analysis of COVID-19 free equilibrium (CFE) and Endemic equilibrium (EE) using Lyaponuv function are considered. We extended the basic model into optimal control system by incorporating three control strategies. These are; use of face-mask and hand sanitizer along with social distancing; treatment of COVID-19 patients and active screening with testing and the third control is prevention against recurrence and reinfection of humans who have recovered from COVID-19. Daily data given by Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) in Nigeria is used for simulation of the proposed COVID-19 model to see the effects of the control measures. The biological interpretation of this findings is that, COVID-19 can be effectively managed or eliminated in Nigeria if the control measures implemented are capable of taking or sustaining the basic reproductive number R 0 to a value below unity. If the three control strategies are well managed by the government namely; NCDC, Presidential Task Force (PTF) and Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) or policymakers, then COVID-19 in Nigeria will be eradicated.

34221402	No evidence that plasmablasts transdifferentiate into developing neutrophils in severe COVID-19 disease. Objectives: A recent single-cell RNA sequencing study by Wilk et al. suggested that plasmablasts can transdifferentiate into 'developing neutrophils' in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. We explore the evidence for this. Methods: We downloaded the original data and code used by the authors in their study to replicate their findings and explore the possibility that regressing out variables may have led the authors to overfit their data. Results: The lineage relationship between plasmablasts and developing neutrophils breaks down when key features are not regressed out, and the data are not overfitted during the analysis. Conclusion: Plasmablasts do not transdifferentiate into developing neutrophils. The single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful technique for biological discovery and hypothesis generation. However, caution should be exercised in the bioinformatic analysis and interpretation of the data and findings cross-validated by orthogonal techniques.	Mechanism;Treatment
34226878	Does Covera-19 know 'when to hold 'em or 'when to fold 'em? A translational thought experiment. The function of proteins depends on their structure. The structural integrity of proteins is dynamic and depends on interacting nearby neighboring moieties that influence their properties and induce folding and structural changes. The conformational changes induced by these nearby neighbors in the micro-environmental milieu at that moment are guided by chemical or electrical bonding attractions. There are few literature references that describe the potential for environmental milieu changes to disfavor SARS-CoV-2 attachment to a receptor for survival outside of a host. There are many studies on the effects of pH (acid and base balance) supporting its importance for protein structure and function, but few focus on pH role in extracellular or intracellular protein or actionable requirements of Covera-19. 'Fold 'em or Hold 'em' is seen by the various functions and effects of furin as it seeks an acidic milieu for action or compatible amino acid sequences which is currently aided by its histidine component and the structural changes of proteins as they enter or exit the host. Questions throughout the text are posed to focus on current thoughts as reviewing applicable COVID-19 translational research science in order to understand the complexities of Covid-19. The pH needs of COVID-19 players and its journey through the human host and environment as well as some efficacious readily available repurposed drugs and out-of-the box and easily available treatments are reviewed.

34210281	"CariesCare International adapted for the pandemic in children: Caries OUT multicentre single-group interventional study protocol. BACKGROUND: Comprehensive caries care has shown effectiveness in controlling caries progression and improving health outcomes by controlling caries risk, preventing initial-caries lesions progression, and patient satisfaction. To date, the caries-progression control effectiveness of the patient-centred risk-based CariesCare International (CCI) system, derived from ICCMS for the practice (2019), remains unproven. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic a previously planned multi-centre RCT shifted to this ""Caries OUT"" study, aiming to assess in a single-intervention group in children, the caries-control effectiveness of CCI adapted for the pandemic with non-aerosols generating procedures (non-AGP) and reducing in-office time. METHODS: In this 1-year multi-centre single-group interventional trial the adapted-CCI effectiveness will be assessed in one single group in terms of tooth-surface level caries progression control, and secondarily, individual-level caries progression control, children's oral-health behaviour change, parents' and dentists' process acceptability, and costs exploration. A sample size of 258 3-5 and 6-8 years old patients was calculated after removing half from the previous RCT, allowing for a 25% dropout, including generally health children (27 per centre). The single-group intervention will be the adapted-CCI 4D-cycle caries care, with non-AGP and reduced in-office appointments' time. A trained examiner per centre will conduct examinations at baseline, at 5-5.5 months (3 months after basic management), 8.5 and 12 months, assessing the child's CCI caries risk and oral-health behaviour, visually staging and assessing caries-lesions severity and activity without air-drying (ICDAS-merged Epi); fillings/sealants; missing/dental-sepsis teeth, and tooth symptoms, synthetizing together with parent and external-trained dental practitioner (DP) the patient- and tooth-surface level diagnoses and personalised care plan. DP will deliver the adapted-CCI caries care. Parents' and dentists' process acceptability will be assessed via Treatment-Evaluation-Inventory questionnaires, and costs in terms of number of appointments and activities. Twenty-one centres in 13 countries will participate. DISCUSSION: The results of Caries OUT adapted for the pandemic will provide clinical data that could help support shifting the caries care in children towards individualised oral-health behaviour improvement and tooth-preserving care, improving health outcomes, and explore if the caries progression can be controlled during the pandemic by conducting non-AGP and reducing in-office time.

34222140	Similarities and Differences Between COVID-19-Related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children and Kawasaki Disease. In December 2019, the first case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China. As of March 2021, there were more than 120 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2.7 million deaths. The COVID-19 mortality rate in adults is around 1-5%, and only a small proportion of children requires hospitalization and intensive care. Recently, an increasing number of COVID-19 cases in children have been associated with a new multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Its clinical features and laboratory characteristics are similar to those of Kawasaki disease (KD), KD shock syndrome, and toxic shock syndrome. However, this new disorder has some distinct clinical features and laboratory characteristics. This condition, also known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, has been observed mostly in Europe and the United States. This emerging phenomenon has raised the question of whether this disorder is KD triggered by SARS-CoV-2 or a syndrome characterized by multisystem inflammation that mimics KD. This narrative review is to discuss the differences between MIS-C and KD with the aim of increasing pediatricians' awareness of this new condition and guide them in the process of differential diagnosis.

34374096	Dietary foods containing nitric oxide donors can be early curators of SARS-CoV-2 infection: A possible role in the immune system. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) is a lethal virus that causes COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though multiple pharmacological trials are ongoing, there is no proof that any treatment will effectively cure or prevent COVID-19. Currently, COVID-19-infected patients are being managed with non-specific medications to suppress the symptoms and other associated co-morbidities. Nitric oxide is a bio-signaling molecule that has been shown to be effective for treating several viral infections in humans. Household Natural foods rich in nitrites and nitrates (NO donors) have been scientifically proven to have therapeutic benefits against immune-related respiratory tract infections. It was understood that NO could inhibit the early stage of SARS CoV-2 invasion into the human cell. Fruits and vegetables containing nitrites and nitrates have been revised and are now thought to be potential anti-CoV agents for effective control of other associated systemic disorders. The purpose of this review is to highlight some key facts about the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 infection with foods rich in nitric oxide and its donors. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Improving the body's immune system is the early step to be considered as a preventive measure to stop the spreading of COVID-19 infection. Emerging research continues to mount that dietary nitrates/nitrites from plant foods are being healthy as well as keep us away from infectious diseases. They are now incorporated into low-risk adjuvant therapy for various infections and systemic disorders. This concept portrays the regular consuming foods such as fruits and vegetables that are rich in nitric oxide which have the potential to promote health, improve general well-being, and reduce the risk associated with the highly contagious diseases. Hence, we recommend adding nitrates and nitrites-containing food to the regular diet to improve the self-immunity as well as to fight against COVID-19 disease.	Mechanism;Treatment
34200325	Evidence for Biological Age Acceleration and Telomere Shortening in COVID-19 Survivors. The SARS-CoV-2 infection determines the COVID-19 syndrome characterized, in the worst cases, by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary and cardiac fibrosis, inflammatory cytokine release, and immunosuppression. This condition has led to the death of about 2.15% of the total infected world population so far. Among survivors, the presence of the so-called persistent post-COVID-19 syndrome (PPCS) is a common finding. In COVID-19 survivors, PPCS presents one or more symptoms: fatigue, dyspnea, memory loss, sleep disorders, and difficulty concentrating. In this study, a cohort of 117 COVID-19 survivors (post-COVID-19) and 144 non-infected volunteers (COVID-19-free) was analyzed using pyrosequencing of defined CpG islands previously identified as suitable for biological age determination. The results show a consistent biological age increase in the post-COVID-19 population, determining a DeltaAge acceleration of 10.45 +/- 7.29 years (+5.25 years above the range of normality) compared with 3.68 +/- 8.17 years for the COVID-19-free population (p < 0.0001). A significant telomere shortening parallels this finding in the post-COVID-19 cohort compared with COVID-19-free subjects (p < 0.0001). Additionally, ACE2 expression was decreased in post-COVID-19 patients, compared with the COVID-19-free population, while DPP-4 did not change. In light of these observations, we hypothesize that some epigenetic alterations are associated with the post-COVID-19 condition, particularly in younger patients (< 60 years).	Mechanism
34199150	New Heparanase-Inhibiting Triazolo-Thiadiazoles Attenuate Primary Tumor Growth and Metastasis. Compelling evidence ties heparanase, an endoglycosidase that cleaves heparan sulfate side (HS) chains of proteoglycans, with all steps of tumor development, including tumor initiation, angiogenesis, growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Moreover, heparanase levels correlate with shorter postoperative survival of cancer patients, encouraging the development of heparanase inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs. Heparanase-inhibiting heparin/heparan sulfate-mimicking compounds and neutralizing antibodies are highly effective in animal models of cancer progression, yet none of the compounds reached the stage of approval for clinical use. The present study focused on newly synthesized triazolo-thiadiazoles, of which compound 4-iodo-2-(3-(p-tolyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-6-yl)phenol (4-MMI) was identified as a potent inhibitor of heparanase enzymatic activity, cell invasion, experimental metastasis, and tumor growth in mouse models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing a marked decrease in primary tumor growth in mice treated with small molecules that inhibit heparanase enzymatic activity. This result encourages the optimization of 4-MMI for preclinical and clinical studies primarily in cancer but also other indications (i.e., colitis, pancreatitis, diabetic nephropathy, tissue fibrosis) involving heparanase, including viral infection and COVID-19.

34227711	Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: A single-center experience. BACKGROUND: This case series aims to evaluate the presenting symptoms, laboratory data, systemic findings, and response to early treatment in patients who were followed up with the diagnosis of multisystemic inflammatory syndrome associated with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The presentation, laboratory findings, and responses to treatment of patients hospitalized and diagnosed with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients were included in the study. The median age was 90 (1.5-204) months and 62.5% of the patients were male; 59.4% of the cases were non-specific disease, 31.2% typical (complete) Kawasaki, and 9.4% had phenotypic characteristics of atypical (incomplete) Kawasaki. Most of the patients were found to have low albumin and elevated C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, and d-dimer, and all patients had elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and procalcitonin. Lymphopenia was detected in 25 patients (78.1%) and serum ferritin levels were elevated in 25 patients (78.1%). Eleven (34.4%) patients responded well only to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. Twenty patients (62.5%) received intravenous immunoglobulin and steroid therapy (second-line therapy). Only one patient (3.1%) received third-line therapy (intravenous immunoglobulin + steroid +anakinra + plasmapheresis). None of the patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients had mild clinical symptoms and responded well to intravenous immunoglobulin and / or steroid therapies as first- and second-line therapies. Only one of our patients was clinically stabilized after third-line treatment because he did not respond to intravenous immunoglobulin and steroid therapy. We think that all of our patients diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children recovered because we had recommended quickly medical intervention. Treatment should therefore be started immediately in patients diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. If there is no response after 24 h to the initial treatment, the next treatment protocol should be started.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34200028	The Risk of Hospitalization in COVID-19 Patients Can Be Predicted by Lung Ultrasound in Primary Care. BACKGROUND: The usefulness of Lung Ultrasound (LUS) for the diagnosis of interstitial syndrome caused by COVID-19 has been broadly described. The aim of this study was to evaluate if LUS may predict the complications (hospital admission) of COVID-19 pneumonia in primary care patients. METHODS: This observational study collects data from a cohort of 279 patients with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia who attended the Balaguer Primary Health Care Area between 16 March 2020 and 30 September 2020. We collected the results of LUS scans reported by one general practitioner. We created a database and analysed the absolute and relative frequencies of LUS findings and their association with hospital admission. We found that different LUS patterns (diffuse, attenuated diffuse, and predominantly unilateral) were risk factors for hospital admission (p < 0.05). Additionally, an evolutionary pattern during the acute phase represented a risk factor (p = 0.0019). On the contrary, a normal ultrasound pattern was a protective factor (p = 0.0037). Finally, the presence of focal interstitial pattern was not associated with hospital admission (p = 0.4918). CONCLUSION: The lung ultrasound was useful to predict complications in COVID-19 pneumonia and to diagnose other lung diseases such as cancer, tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism, chronic interstitial pneumopathy, pleuropericarditis, pneumonia or heart failure.

34206977	Developing the First Telenursing Service for COVID-19 Patients: The Experience of South Korea. This study aimed to examine the process of establishing a telenursing service for COVID-19 patients with mild or no symptoms admitted to a community treatment center (CTC). The process of establishing the service was reviewed, and the degree of satisfaction with the provided service was investigated based on the medical records the patients submitted at their discharge from the CTC. A total of 113 patients were admitted; the patients themselves entered the self-measured vital signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection to the electronic questionnaires and mobile application. The nurses implemented remote nursing based on the patients' input data. The educational materials, including the video for self-measuring vital signs and the living guidelines, were prepared and arranged in advance. The telenursing protocol regarding the whole process from the patients' admission to their discharge was used and applied to five other CTCs. The non-contact counseling service's satisfaction and convenience scores were 4.65 points and 4.62 points, respectively, out of 5 points. The non-contact nursing counseling service played an important role in monitoring patients' medical conditions during the spread of COVID-19. This experience of establishing telenursing services to the CTC provides a clear direction to innovate healthcare services in future disasters.	Prevention
34226895	A bivalent recombinant vaccine targeting the S1 protein induces neutralizing antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 variants and wild-type of the virus. The emerging variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in pandemic call for the urgent development of universal corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines which could be effective for both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and mutant strains. In the current study, we formulated protein subunit vaccines with AS03 adjuvant and recombinant proteins of S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 (S1-WT) and S1 variant (K417N, E484K, N501Y, and D614G) subunit (S1-Mut), and immunized transgenic mice that express human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The S1 protein-specific antibody production and the neutralization capability for SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.351 variant were measured after immunization in mice. The results revealed that the S1-Mut antigens were more effective in inhibiting the receptor-binding domain and ACE2 binding in B.1.351 variant than in wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the development of a bivalent vaccine exhibited the ideal neutralization properties against wild-type and B.1.351 variant, as well as other variants. Our findings may provide a rationale for the development of a bivalent recombinant vaccine targeting the S1 protein that can induce the neutralizing antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 variants and wild-type of the virus and may be of importance to explore the potential clinical use of bivalent recombinant vaccine in the future.

34212285	Lockdown effects on Parkinson's disease during COVID-19 pandemic: a pilot study. The coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak precipitated prolonged lock-down measures. The subsequent social distancing, isolation, and reduction in mobility increased psychological stress, which may worsen Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, telemedicine has been proposed to provide care to PD patients. To evaluate the effects of lock-down on motor and nonmotor symptoms in PD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and the feasibility of telemedicine. Motor and nonmotor aspects were longitudinally assessed using structured questionnaires at baseline (in-person, February 2020) and at follow-up (remote web-based video, lock-down) evaluation. Of the seventeen PD patients evaluated at baseline, fourteen agreed to participate in, and completed follow-up evaluations. There was an impairment of nonmotor aspects measured with the MDS-UPDRS part I (p < 0.001) during lock-down. Nine patients participated independently in the telemedicine evaluation while five needed help from relatives. Our preliminary findings suggest an impairment of nonmotor symptoms in PD patients and support the feasibility and need for telemedicine in monitoring PD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, to guarantee optimal assistance with reducing the burden of infection. Our findings also suggest that movement disorder clinics should be carefully considering socio-demographics and clinical features when developing telemedicine programs.	Prevention
34288632	Ischemic Lesions in the Brain of a Neonate With SARS-CoV2 Infection. Aim: To describe a term newborn with acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and multisystem involvement including seizures associated to ischemic lesions in the brain. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is predominantly a respiratory infection, but it may affect many other systems. Most pediatric COVID-19 cases range from asymptomatic to mild-moderate disease. There are no specific clinical signs described for neonatal COVID-19 infections. In children, severe central nervous system compromise has been rarely reported. Case Description: We describe a 17-day-old newborn who acquired a SARS-CoV-2 infection in a family meeting that was admitted for fever, seizures and lethargy and in whom consumption coagulopathy, ischemic lesions in the brain and cardiac involvement were documented. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 neonatal infection can be associated with multi-organic involvement. In our patient, significant central nervous system compromise associated to ischemic lesions and laboratory findings of consumption coagulopathy were found. Clinical Significance: Although neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are infrequent, they can be associated with multi-organic involvement. Neonatologists and pediatricians should be aware of this unusual way of presentation of COVID-19 in newborn infants.	Case Report
34216732	Danish citizens' preferences for at-home oropharyngeal/nasal SARS-CoV-2 specimen collection. INTRODUCTION: Diagnostic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 by self-collection of specimens is a reliable method compared with healthcare worker collected samples. Citizens' preferences for collection methods are unknown, but at-home collection could have several advantages. METHODS: This study investigated the preference for guided at-home self-collection versus at-hospital specimen collection by healthcare workers. RESULTS: Among the 3709 participants, at-home swab collection was the preferred setting for 2362 (63.7%) compared with 1347 (36.3%) reporting a preference for an at-hospital swabbing procedure. CONCLUSION: A high preference for guided at-home self-collection of oropharyngeal/nasal SARS-CoV-2 specimens exists and could be a future norm beyond COVID-19.	Diagnosis
34209289	Pathophysiology and Clinical Manifestations of COVID-19-Related Acute Kidney Injury-The Current State of Knowledge and Future Perspectives. The continually evolving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in a vast number of either acute or chronic medical impairments of a pathophysiology that is not yet fully understood. SARS-CoV-2 tropism for the organs is associated with bilateral organ cross-talks as well as targeted dysfunctions, among which acute kidney injury (AKI) seems to be highly prevalent in infected patients. The need for efficient management of COVID-related AKI patients is an aspect that is still being investigated by nephrologists; however, another reason for concern is a disturbingly high proportion of various types of kidney dysfunctions in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. Even though the clinical picture of AKI and COVID-related AKI seems to be quite similar, it must be considered that regarding the latter, little is known about both the optimal management and long-term consequences. These discrepancies raise an urgent need for further research aimed at evaluating the molecular mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2-induced kidney damage as well as standardized management of COVID-related AKI patients. The following review presents a comprehensive and most-recent insight into the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, recommended patient management, treatment strategies, and post-mortem findings in patients with COVID-related AKI.

34336867	Genome Editing Technologies as Cellular Defense Against Viral Pathogens. Viral infectious diseases are significant threats to the welfare of world populations. Besides the widespread acute viral infections (e.g., dengue fever) and chronic infections [e.g., those by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV)], emerging viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pose great challenges to the world. Genome editing technologies, including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), have played essential roles in the study of new treatment for viral infectious diseases in cell lines, animal models, and clinical trials. Genome editing tools have been used to eliminate latent infections and provide resistance to new infections. Increasing evidence has shown that genome editing-based antiviral strategy is simple to design and can be quickly adapted to combat infections by a wide spectrum of viral pathogens, including the emerging coronaviruses. Here we review the development and applications of genome editing technologies for preventing or eliminating infections caused by HIV, HBV, HPV, HSV, and SARS-CoV-2, and discuss how the latest advances could enlighten further development of genome editing into a novel therapy for viral infectious diseases.

34217471	Impact of novel coronavirus infection in patients with uveitis associated with an autoimmune disease: Result of the COVID-19-GEAS patient survey. INTRODUCTION: The objective of these study is to know the characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with uveitis associated with Systemic Autoimmune Disease (SAD) through telematic survey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Internal Medicine Society and Group of Systemic Autoimmune disease conducted a telematic survey of patients with SAD to learn about the characteristics of COVID-19 in this population. RESULTS: A total of 2,789 patients answered the survey, of which 28 had a diagnosis of uveitis associated with SAE. The majority (82%) were female and caucasian (82%), with a mean age of 48 years. The most frequent SAEs were Behcet's disease followed by sarcoidosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. 46% of the patients were receiving corticosteroid treatment at a mean prednisone dose of 11 mg/day. Regarding infection, 14 (50%) patients reported symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RT-PCR was performed on the nasopharyngeal smear in two patients and in one of them (4%) it was positive. CONCLUSIONS: Both asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients with ASD-associated UNI had received similar immunosuppressive treatment.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34281735	Pilot study to evaluate safety culture perception in the operating theatres of an acute NHS Trust using the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) App. An area critical to safety in an organisation is the perceived and actual culture. National Air Traffic Services (NATS) work closely with large safety-critical industries including various aviation companies to enable them to identify strengths and vulnerabilities with the aim of improving safe practice. NATS have developed a simple free downloadable self-assessment App that individuals can use to assess their own culture perception in their organisation. The App has 16 questions arranged in four domains but to our knowledge it has not been used to date in healthcare. As part of the initiatives to improve staff culture, we evaluated operating theatre colleagues' safety perception in our large acute NHS Trust in a pilot study using the NATS safety App. Staff downloaded the App to their smart device before completing it. Responses were sent anonymously through the App and collated by NATS. A total of 146 colleagues downloaded and completed the questionnaire. One hundred and seventeen staff (80%) felt encouraged to report safety concerns, but 86% (n=126) confirmed a lack of available support from healthcare managers. Only 43% of respondents (n=63) would find it easy to challenge colleagues if they observed unsafe behaviour. This pilot study has identified positive indicators of an evolving NHS safety culture, and some concerns about speaking up, support, and challenging colleagues without fear. These issues are known to occur across healthcare. Further work is needed in the NHS to provide a supportive environment to improve patient safety, and lower hierarchy in surgical teams.	Prevention
34287238	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Diagnostic Tools: A Focus on Detection Technologies and Limitations. The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a severe threat to human health and the global economy and has resulted in overwhelming stress on health care systems worldwide. Despite the global health catastrophe, especially in the number of infections and fatalities, the COVID-19 pandemic has also revolutionized research and discovery with remarkable success in diagnostics, treatments, and vaccine development. The use of many diagnostic methods has helped establish public health guidelines to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. However, limited information has been shared about these methods, and there is a need for the scientific community to learn about these technologies, in addition to their sensitivity, specificity, and limitations. This review article is focused on providing insights into the major methods used for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We describe in detail the core principle of each method, including molecular and serological approaches, along with reported claims about the rates of false negatives and false positives, the types of specimens needed, and the level of technology and the time required to perform each test. Although this study will not rank or prioritize these methods, the information will help in the development of guidelines and diagnostic protocols in clinical settings and reference laboratories.

34226584	"Accurate long-range forecasting of COVID-19 mortality in the USA. The need for improved models that can accurately predict COVID-19 dynamics is vital to managing the pandemic and its consequences. We use machine learning techniques to design an adaptive learner that, based on epidemiological data available at any given time, produces a model that accurately forecasts the number of reported COVID-19 deaths and cases in the United States, up to 10 weeks into the future with a mean absolute percentage error of 9%. In addition to being the most accurate long-range COVID predictor so far developed, it captures the observed periodicity in daily reported numbers. Its effectiveness is based on three design features: (1) producing different model parameters to predict the number of COVID deaths (and cases) from each time and for a given number of weeks into the future, (2) systematically searching over the available covariates and their historical values to find an effective combination, and (3) training the model using ""last-fold partitioning"", where each proposed model is validated on only the last instance of the training dataset, rather than being cross-validated. Assessments against many other published COVID predictors show that this predictor is 19-48% more accurate."	Epidemic Forecasting
34363275	Mesenchymal stem cells and their derived exosomes to combat Covid-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Effective therapies are required for the treatment of patients with severe stages of the disease. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been evaluated in numerous clinical trials, but present challenges, such as carcinogenic risk and special storage conditions, coupled with insufficient data about their mechanism of action. The majority of unique properties of MSCs are related to their paracrine activity and especially to their exosomes. The impact of MSCs-derived exosomes (MSC-Es) on complications of Covid-19 has been investigated in several studies. MSC-Es may improve some complications of Covid-19 such as cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI). Additionally, these exosomes can be evaluated as an applicable nano-size carrier for antiviral therapeutic agents. Herein, we consider several potential applications of MSCs and their derived exosomes in the treatment of Covid-19.	Treatment
34218402	Pharmacists' involvement in COVID-19 vaccination across Europe: a situational analysis of current practice and policy. One year since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid response measures have been implemented internationally to mitigate the spread of the virus. Following rapid and successful pre-clinical and human trials, several vaccines have been authorised for use across Europe through the European Medicines Agency and national regulatory authorities. Clinical trials have shown promising results including important reductions in disease severity, hospitalisation and mortality. In order to maximise the public health benefit of available vaccines, there is a pressing need to vaccinate a large proportion of the population. Internationally, this has prompted coordination of existing services at enormous scale, and development and implementation of novel vaccination strategies to ensure maximum inoculation over the shortest possible timeframe. Pharmacists are being promoted as healthcare professionals that enhance roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination programmes. This paper aims to summarise current policy and practice in relation to pharmacists' involvement in COVID-19 vaccination in 13 countries across Europe.	Prevention
34211656	Love in the time of COVID-19: a scoping review on male sexual health. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak constitutes an unparalleled socioeconomic burden on the global scale. In critically ill COVID-19 patients, the disease manifests as a state of hyper inflammation causing the 'cytokine storm', which leads to various pulmonary, cardiovascular, and spurious manifestations. One such reported sequelae of COVID-19 is sexual dysfunction in males even after recovery from the disease. Various mechanisms have been proposed regarding the erectile dysfunction a patient suffers after COVID-19. Most important is the hypothesis of endothelial dysregulation, subclinical hypogonadism, psychosocial misery, and pulmonary impairment contributing to erectile dysfunction. Assessment of testicular function and hormonal axis is needed to assess the novel association of COVID-19 with sexual and reproductive health issues in males.	Mechanism
34202098	"How Do Enveloped Viruses Exploit the Secretory Proprotein Convertases to Regulate Infectivity and Spread? Inhibition of the binding of enveloped viruses surface glycoproteins to host cell receptor(s) is a major target of vaccines and constitutes an efficient strategy to block viral entry and infection of various host cells and tissues. Cellular entry usually requires the fusion of the viral envelope with host plasma membranes. Such entry mechanism is often preceded by ""priming"" and/or ""activation"" steps requiring limited proteolysis of the viral surface glycoprotein to expose a fusogenic domain for efficient membrane juxtapositions. The 9-membered family of Proprotein Convertases related to Subtilisin/Kexin (PCSK) serine proteases (PC1, PC2, Furin, PC4, PC5, PACE4, PC7, SKI-1/S1P, and PCSK9) participate in post-translational cleavages and/or regulation of multiple secretory proteins. The type-I membrane-bound Furin and SKI-1/S1P are the major convertases responsible for the processing of surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses. Stefan Kunz has considerably contributed to define the role of SKI-1/S1P in the activation of arenaviruses causing hemorrhagic fever. Furin was recently implicated in the activation of the spike S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and Furin-inhibitors are being tested as antivirals in COVID-19. Other members of the PCSK-family are also implicated in some viral infections, such as PCSK9 in Dengue. Herein, we summarize the various functions of the PCSKs and present arguments whereby their inhibition could represent a powerful arsenal to limit viral infections causing the present and future pandemics."

34209705	COVID-19-Associated Cardiovascular Complications. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported to cause cardiovascular complications such as myocardial injury, thromboembolic events, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Multiple mechanisms-some overlapping, notably the role of inflammation and IL-6-potentially underlie these complications. The reported cardiac injury may be a result of direct viral invasion of cardiomyocytes with consequent unopposed effects of angiotensin II, increased metabolic demand, immune activation, or microvascular dysfunction. Thromboembolic events have been widely reported in both the venous and arterial systems that have attracted intense interest in the underlying mechanisms. These could potentially be due to endothelial dysfunction secondary to direct viral invasion or inflammation. Additionally, thromboembolic events may also be a consequence of an attempt by the immune system to contain the infection through immunothrombosis and neutrophil extracellular traps. Cardiac arrhythmias have also been reported with a wide range of implicated contributory factors, ranging from direct viral myocardial injury, as well as other factors, including at-risk individuals with underlying inherited arrhythmia syndromes. Heart failure may also occur as a progression from cardiac injury, precipitation secondary to the initiation or withdrawal of certain drugs, or the accumulation of des-Arg(9)-bradykinin (DABK) with excessive induction of pro-inflammatory G protein coupled receptor B1 (BK1). The presenting cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain, dyspnoea, and palpitations. There is currently intense interest in vaccine-induced thrombosis and in the treatment of Long COVID since many patients who have survived COVID-19 describe persisting health problems. This review will summarise the proposed physiological mechanisms of COVID-19-associated cardiovascular complications.	Mechanism;Treatment
34208191	Full-Length Computational Model of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and Its Implications for a Viral Membrane Fusion Mechanism. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has now become one of the greatest causes of infectious death and morbidity since the 1918 flu pandemic. Substantial and unprecedented progress has been made in the elucidation of the viral infection process in a short time; however, our understanding of the structure-function dynamics of the spike protein during the membrane fusion process and viral uptake remains incomplete. Employing computational approaches, we use full-length structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein integrating Cryo-EM images and biophysical properties, which fill the gaps in our understanding. We propose a membrane fusion model incorporating structural transitions associated with the proteolytic processing of the spike protein, which initiates and regulates a series of events to facilitate membrane fusion and viral genome uptake. The membrane fusion mechanism highlights the notable role of the S1 subunit and eventual mature spike protein uptake through the host membrane. Our comprehensive view accounts for distinct neutralizing antibody binding effects targeting the spike protein and the enhanced infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 variant.	Mechanism;Treatment
34336562	Stochastic modelling of the dynamics of infections caused by the SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 under various conditions of lockdown, quarantine, and testing. We develop a mathematical model for the transmission and spread of infections caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease that has since been classified, by the World Health Organization, as a global pandemic. We focus attention on virus transmissions in a closed population and hence use a compartmental epidemic model to study the inherent dynamics of infections between the various subgroups of the population. We assume random interactions between members from different subgroups and hence we employ stochastic modelling techniques. In the absence of a vaccine for this novel coronavirus, governments worldwide have put in place various intervention strategies, including travel bans, lockdowns, screening, testing, quarantine, etc. in order to reduce and hopefully eliminate the transmission and spread of the COVID-19 virus. These interventions are built into our model and we investigate their effects and effectiveness. In particular, we observe that the two subgroups containing infectious individuals, namely; the subgroup comprising of unidentified asymptomatic individuals as well as; the subgroup comprising of un-quarantined symptomatic individuals; pose the greatest risk of the transmission and spread of infections. We therefore also observe from our results that; rapid (realtime) mass testing as well as effective (or mandatory) quarantine of all infected individuals are the fundamentally critical and necessary steps in reducing the internal transmissions and spread of the COVID-19 virus. In particular, our results indicate that lockdowns are only important to the extent that, if implemented effectively, they help in reducing the rate of transmissions (i.e. help to 'flatten' the transmission curves) and hence allow policy makers and healthcare practitioners to put in place the important processes of realtime mass testing and mandatory quarantine, including hospitalization and treatment. Our results are presented over a single wave (or part of a single wave) of COVID-19 infections in a given population. If conditions are repeated, the results would correspondingly extend to multiple waves of infection.	Prevention;Transmission
34353284	Dynamic profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospitalized patients in Kuwait: a descriptive study. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan (China) in December 2019 is currently spreading rapidly worldwide. This study aimed to analyze the dynamic profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospitalized patients that would characterize the period of viral shedding and detection among patients. METHODS: Retrospectively, 103 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients hospitalized at Jaber hospital in Kuwait were included. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were collected. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained at different time intervals and analyzed by Real-Time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Of 103 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the median age was 41 years, and 64% were male. The median period from admission to the positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was 19 days (IQR, 13-22). The median period from admission to active negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result was 22 days (IQR, 16-26). Older patients, patients with comorbidities, and patients with symptoms were more likely to have extended viral shedding. CONCLUSION: For the first time, this descriptive study conducted in Kuwait on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results from 103 patients positive for SARS-provided solid proof and a good understanding of the dynamic profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients in Kuwait. This information will further enrich the global knowledge on the emerging SARS-CoV-2.	Diagnosis
34217106	Rapid antigen tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2: A narrative review. The rapid identificationand isolation of COVID-19 patients has become the cornerstone for the control of the recent outbreak. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction is routinely used to confirm COVID-19 diagnosis and is considered the gold standard due to high sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, it usually takes several days and a relatively higher cost. Antigen tests based have emerged to cope with such disadvantages, by offering rapid results, an easy-to-use procedure, and low costs. The objective of the narrative review was to provide up-to-date data about CE-marked rapid antigen tests (RATs) for COVID-19. Given their large number, the study only focused on representative and widely used in Spain (Standard Q, Nadal, Panbio, CerTest, and Wondfo). RATs have become a very useful and validated tool for controlling the spread of COVID-19 allowing the rapid identification of active infection and isolation of positive patients. The present revision of the literature has demonstrated that sensitivity and specificity of all available RATs in Spain are high and accomplish European regulations and WHO recommendations.	Diagnosis
34207378	Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines and Monoclonal Antibodies Facing Viral Variants. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is genetically variable, allowing it to adapt to various hosts including humans. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 has accumulated around two mutations per genome each month. The first relevant event in this context was the occurrence of the mutant D614G in the Spike gene. Moreover, several variants have emerged, including the well-characterized 20I/501Y.V1, 20H/501Y.V2, and 20J/501Y.V3 strains, in addition to those that have been detected within clusters, such as 19B/501Y or 20C/655Y in France. Mutants have also emerged in animals, including a variant transmitted to humans, namely, the Mink variant detected in Denmark. The emergence of these variants has affected the transmissibility of the virus (for example, 20I/501Y.V1, which was up to 82% more transmissible than other preexisting variants), its severity, and its ability to escape natural, adaptive, vaccine, and therapeutic immunity. In this respect, we review the literature on variants that have currently emerged, and their effect on vaccines and therapies, and, in particular, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants must be examined to allow effective preventive and curative control strategies to be developed.	Mechanism;Treatment
34132811	COVID-19 related mortality in kidney transplant and hemodialysis patients: a comparative, prospective registry based study. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has exposed hemodialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients to an unprecedented life-threatening infectious disease raising concerns about kidney replacement therapy (KRT) strategy during the pandemic. The present study investigated the association of type of KRT with COVID-19 severity adjusting for differences in individual characteristics. METHODS: Data on kidney transplant recipients and hemodialysis patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 1st and December 1st 2020 were retrieved from ERACODA. Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, frailty and comorbidities were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for 28-day mortality risk in all patients and in the subsets who were tested because of symptoms. RESULTS: In total, 1,670 patients (496 functional kidney transplant and 1,174 hemodialysis) were included. 16.9% of kidney transplant and 23.9% of hemodialysis patients died within 28 days of presentation. The unadjusted 28-day mortality risk was 33% lower in kidney transplant recipients compared with hemodialysis patients (HR: 0.67, 95%CI: 0.52-0.85). In a fully adjusted model, the risk was 78% higher in kidney transplant recipients (HR: 1.78, 95%CI: 1.22-2.61) compared with hemodialysis patients. This association was similar in patients tested because of symptoms (fully adjusted model HR: 2.00, 95%CI: 1.31-3.06). This risk was dramatically increased during the first post-transplant year. Results were similar for other endpoints (e.g. hospitalization, ICU admission, mortality beyond 28 days) and across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients had a greater risk of a more severe course of COVID-19 compared with hemodialysis patients; they therefore require specific infection mitigation strategies.

34222414	Surgery for pancreatic tumors in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in 2020 has had a significant impact on the treatment of cancer worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the biggest challenge for pancreatic surgeons is the difficulty in providing oncological care. In this review article, from the standpoint of surgeons, we explain the concept of triaging of patients with pancreatic tumors under the COVID-19 pandemic, and the actual impact of COVID-19 on the treatment of patients with pancreatic tumors. The most vital points in selecting the best therapeutic approach for patients with pancreatic tumors during this pandemic are (1) Oncologists need to tailor the treatment plan based on the COVID-19 phase, tumor malignant potential, and patients' comorbidities; and (2) Optimal treatment for pancreatic cancer should be planned according to the condition of each patient and tumor resectability based on national comprehensive cancer network resectability criteria. To choose the best therapeutic approach for patients with pancreatic tumors during this pandemic, we need to tailor the treatment plan based on elective surgery acuity scale (ESAS). Newly established ESAS for pancreatic tumor and flowchart indicating the treatment strategy of pancreatic cancer, are feasible to overcome this situation.	Prevention
34214071	Characteristics of the coronavirus disease 2019: A review of emerging literature. Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19) spread rapidly around the world. The extent and ultimate effect are still unclear, as it is an ongoing and constantly evolving pandemic. Aims: To compile the literature and synthesize in Spanish-Latin American language the available international information describing the etiological, pathophysiological, epidemiological and management aspects of COVID-19. Methods: Narrative review, using specific sections created in the databases. The criteria for selecting studies depended on the specific area addressed: etiological, pathophysiological, epidemiological aspects, treatment alternatives, etc. References in Spanish and English were included. Results: The World Health Organization reports that COVID-19 is a disease of zoonotic origin that was transmitted to a human host. The first cases were identified in late 2019 and January 2020, in Wuhan city, China. It was categorized as highly contagious and transmissible between humans, which is attributed to the structural features of this novel coronavirus. The clinical presentation is variable and nonspecific, as well as its severity. With a clear tropism for the respiratory system, the most severe cases may develop pneumonia, respiratory failure, multiorgan failure and thus death. It occurs in all age groups, with a lower percentage in children under 19 years of age (2.4%). Mortality varies between countries and regions (between 1.5 to 9.3% over the total of reported cases). Associated risk factors are the presence of comorbidities, advanced age, and immunosuppression. Conclusions: To date there have been thousands of scientific articles that attempt to explain the onset, progression, possible treatment options and global impact of the disease. There is still no certainty about the level or quality of this evidence. It is essential to generate documents synthesized and translated into Spanish or other languages that can bring this information to all the places and countries that are being impacted by this disease.

34287999	Structural insights into the distinctive RNA recognition and therapeutic potentials of RIG-I-like receptors. RNA viruses, including the coronavirus, develop a unique strategy to evade the host immune response by interrupting the normal function of cytosolic retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs). RLRs rapidly detect atypical nucleic acids, thereby triggering the antiviral innate immune signaling cascade and subsequently activates the interferons transcription and induction of other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Nonetheless, these receptors are manipulated by viral proteins to subvert the host immune system and sustain the infectivity and replication potential of the virus. RIG-I senses the single-stranded, double-stranded, and short double-stranded RNAs and recognizes the key signature, a 5'-triphosphate moiety, at the blunt end of the viral RNA. Meanwhile, the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) is triggered by longer double stranded RNAs, messenger RNAs lacking 2'-O-methylation in their 5'-cap, and RNA aggregates. Therefore, structural insights into the nucleic-acid-sensing and downstream signaling mechanisms of these receptors hold great promise for developing effective antiviral therapeutic interventions. This review highlights the critical roles played by RLRs in viral infections as well as their ligand recognition mechanisms. In addition, we highlight the crosstalk between the toll-like receptors and RLRs and provide a comprehensive overview of RLR-associated diseases as well as the therapeutic potential of RLRs for the development of antiviral-drugs. Moreover, we believe that these RLR-based antivirals will serve as a step toward countering the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.	Mechanism;Treatment
34378952	SARS-CoV-2 Isolates Show Impaired Replication in Human Immune Cells but Differential Ability to Replicate and Induce Innate Immunity in Lung Epithelial Cells. The primary target organ of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is the respiratory tract. Currently, there is limited information on the ability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to infect and regulate innate immunity in human immune cells and lung epithelial cells. Here, we compared the ability of four Finnish isolates of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients to replicate and induce interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines in different human cells. All isolates failed to replicate in dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, and lymphocytes, and no induction of cytokine gene expression was seen. However, most of the isolates replicated in Calu-3 cells, and they readily induced type I and type III IFN gene expression. The hCoV-19/Finland/FIN-25/2020 isolate, originating from a traveler from Milan in March 2020, showed better ability to replicate and induce IFN and inflammatory responses in Calu-3 cells than other isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Our data increase the knowledge on the pathogenesis and antiviral mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cell systems. IMPORTANCE With the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, information on the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and regulation of innate immunity in human immune cells and lung epithelial cells is needed. In the present study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 failed to productively infect human immune cells, but different isolates of SARS-CoV-2 showed differential ability to replicate and regulate innate interferon responses in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. These findings will open up the way for further studies on the mechanisms of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells.	Mechanism;Treatment
34351807	Preoperative chest computed tomography in emergency surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic challenges the recommendations for patients' preoperative assessment for preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 transmission and COVID-19-associated postoperative complications and morbidities. PURPOSE: To evaluate the contribution of chest computed tomography for preoperatively assessing patients who are not suspected of being infected with COVID-19 at the time of referral. METHODS: Candidates for emergency surgery screened via chest computed tomography from 8 to 27 April 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Computed tomography images were analysed for the presence of COVID-19-associated intrapulmonary changes. When applicable, laboratory and recorded clinical symptoms were extracted. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients underwent preoperative chest computed tomography; 24% were rated as moderately suspicious and 11% as highly suspicious on computed tomography. Subsequent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed for seven patients, all of whom tested negative for COVID-19. Seven patients showed COVID-19-associated clinical symptoms, and most were classified as being mildly to moderately severe as per the clinical classification grading system. Only one case was severe. Four cases underwent RT-PCR with negative results. CONCLUSION: In a cohort without clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection upon referral, preoperative computed tomography during the COVID-19 pandemic can yield a high suspicion of infection, even if the patient lacks clinical symptoms and is RT-PCR-negative. No recommendations can be made based on our results but contribute to the debate.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34205861	Reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus after Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Seven immunocompetent patients aged > 50 years old presented with herpes zoster (HZ) infection in a median of 9 days (range 7-20) after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The occurrence of HZ within the time window 1-21 days after vaccination defined for increased risk and the reported T cell-mediated immunity involvement suggest that COVID-19 vaccination is a probable cause of HZ. These cases support the importance of continuing assessment of vaccine safety during the ongoing massive vaccination for the COVID-19 pandemic and encourage reporting and communication of any vaccination-associated adverse event.

34346306	COVID-19 in South Korea: Proper timing for Easing Mask mandates after COVID-19 Vaccination. As of 25 July 2021, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 1,422 new COVID-19 cases, 188,848 total cases, and 2.073 total deaths (1.10% fatality rates). Since the first SARS-CoV-2 case was reported, efforts to find a treatment and vaccine against COVID-19 have been widespread. Four vaccines are on the WHO's emergency use listing and are approved of their usage; BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, AZD1222, and Ad26.COV2.S. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 need at least 14 days to achieve effectiveness. Thus, people should abide by prevention and control measures, including wearing masks, washing hands, and social distancing. However, a lot of new cases were reported after vaccinations, as many people did not follow the prevention control measures before the end of the 14 days period. There is no doubt we need to break free from mask mandates. But let us not decide the timing in haste. Even if the mask mandates are eased, they should be changed depending on the number of reported cases, vaccinations, as well as prevention and control measures on how circumstances are changing under the influence of mutant coronavirus.

34207056	Assessment of Knowledge, Practice and Attitude about Biomedical Waste Management among Healthcare Professionals during COVID-19 Crises in Al-Ahsa. Biomedical waste (BMW) management is an essential practice of healthcare professionals (HCPs) for preventing health and also environmental hazards. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, posing significant challenges for healthcare sectors. A cross-sectional study was performed to assess the knowledge, practice, and attitude on BMW management among HCPs when taking care of patients with COVID-19 and associated with demographic variables. From Al-Ahsa healthcare sectors, 256 HCPs were selected randomly, of which 105 (41%) had excellent knowledge, 87 (34%) had good knowledge, and 64 (25%) had poor knowledge with a mean score of 13.1 +/- 3.6. A higher mean score was (14.4 +/- 3.2) obtained by physicians, and (13.6 +/- 3.8) nurses than the other HCPs. Regarding practice, 72 (28.1%) HCPs used and discarded PPE while handling biomedical wastes. Additionally, 88 (34.4%) followed proper hand hygiene before and after each procedure and whenever needed. Physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists had a more favorable attitude than other HCPs. There was a statistically significant association found among knowledge level and educational qualification (p < 0.0001), gender (p < 0.001), and work experience (p < 0.05). Emphasis is needed to train all HCPs regarding proper BMW management during this pandemic to prevent infection transmission.	Prevention
34292110	Communicable Illness Mitigation Strategies for Traveling Elite Sporting Organizations. CONTEXT: Transmission of communicable diseases observed in sporting organizations is often preventable. Early detection, isolation, and treatment can significantly diminish time lost. Until recently, there has been a paucity of standardized guidelines outlining feasible, preventable measures to protect both athletes and staff from contagious illnesses. Therefore, the purpose of this narrative was to highlight optimal prevention practices for transmission mitigation, with a particular focus on hygiene activity and travel considerations in professional sporting organizations. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and peer-reviewed journals. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 5. RESULTS: Communicable illness prevention strategies begin at the level of sufficient personal hygiene practices. Common area surface cleaning recommendations, including shared equipment sanitization between usage as well as designated equipment use to specific athletes, should be considered to minimize cross-contamination, in particular, for liked-position players. Intelligent design for shared areas can include redistributing the layout of communal spaces, most feasibly, spreading locker designation a minimum distance of 6 ft from one another. Travel considerations can include placing most susceptible passengers closest to window seating, boarding last and exiting first. Team physicians should have knowledge of essential personnel medical histories in an effort to risk stratify staff members and players in the setting of communicable disease. CONCLUSION: Providing a framework for illness management and prevention is important when considering the effects on player health, missed time, performance, and overall cost. Containment of commonly observed communicable illnesses can be optimized with sufficient personal hygiene practices, common area surface cleaning recommendations, intelligent design for shared areas, travel and hotel considerations, as well as appropriate screening tools and isolation techniques.

34283183	Effect of Canakinumab vs Placebo on Survival Without Invasive Mechanical Ventilation in Patients Hospitalized With Severe COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Effective treatments for patients with severe COVID-19 are needed. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of canakinumab, an anti-interleukin-1beta antibody, in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial was conducted at 39 hospitals in Europe and the United States. A total of 454 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, hypoxia (not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]), and systemic hyperinflammation defined by increased blood concentrations of C-reactive protein or ferritin were enrolled between April 30 and August 17, 2020, with the last assessment of the primary end point on September 22, 2020. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a single intravenous infusion of canakinumab (450 mg for body weight of 40-<60 kg, 600 mg for 60-80 kg, and 750 mg for >80 kg; n = 227) or placebo (n = 227). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was survival without IMV from day 3 to day 29. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19-related mortality, measurements of biomarkers of systemic hyperinflammation, and safety evaluations. Results: Among 454 patients who were randomized (median age, 59 years; 187 women [41.2%]), 417 (91.9%) completed day 29 of the trial. Between days 3 and 29, 198 of 223 patients (88.8%) survived without requiring IMV in the canakinumab group and 191 of 223 (85.7%) in the placebo group, with a rate difference of 3.1% (95% CI, -3.1% to 9.3%) and an odds ratio of 1.39 (95% CI, 0.76 to 2.54; P = .29). COVID-19-related mortality occurred in 11 of 223 patients (4.9%) in the canakinumab group vs 16 of 222 (7.2%) in the placebo group, with a rate difference of -2.3% (95% CI, -6.7% to 2.2%) and an odds ratio of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.30 to 1.50). Serious adverse events were observed in 36 of 225 patients (16%) treated with canakinumab vs 46 of 223 (20.6%) who received placebo. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, treatment with canakinumab, compared with placebo, did not significantly increase the likelihood of survival without IMV at day 29.

34221359	Macro level factors influencing strategic responses to emergent pandemics: A scoping review. Background: Strategic planning is critical for successful pandemic management. This study aimed to identify and review the scope and analytic depth of situation analyses conducted to understand their utility, and capture the documented macro-level factors impacting pandemic management. Methods: To synthesise this disparate body of literature, we adopted a two-step search and review process. A systematic search of the literature was conducted to identify all studies since 2000, that have 1) employed a situation analysis; and 2) examined contextual factors influencing pandemic management. The included studies are analysed using a seven-domain systems approach from the discipline of strategic management. Results: Nineteen studies were included in the final review ranging from single country (6) to regional, multi-country studies (13). Fourteen studies had a single disease focus, with 5 studies evaluating responses to one or more of COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Influenza A (H1N1), Ebola virus disease, and Zika virus disease pandemics. Six studies examined a single domain from political, economic, sociological, technological, ecological or wider industry (PESTELI), 5 studies examined two to four domains, and 8 studies examined five or more domains. Methods employed were predominantly literature reviews. The recommendations focus predominantly on addressing inhibitors in the sociological and technological domains with few recommendations articulated in the political domain. Overall, the legislative domain is least represented. Conclusions: Ex-post analysis using the seven-domain strategic management framework provides further opportunities for a planned systematic response to pandemics which remains critical as the current COVID-19 pandemic evolves.

34205044	Type-2 Diabetes as a Risk Factor for Severe COVID-19 Infection. The current outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has generated a notable challenge for diabetic patients. Overall, people with diabetes have a higher risk of developing different infectious diseases and demonstrate increased mortality. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a significant risk factor for COVID-19 progression and its severity, poor prognosis, and increased mortality. How diabetes contributes to COVID-19 severity is unclear; however, it may be correlated with the effects of hyperglycemia on systemic inflammatory responses and immune system dysfunction. Using the envelope spike glycoprotein SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, a key protein expressed in metabolic organs and tissues such as pancreatic islets. Therefore, it has been suggested that diabetic patients are more susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, as glucose metabolism impairments complicate the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease in these patients. In this review, we provide insight into the COVID-19 disease complications relevant to diabetes and try to focus on the present data and growing concepts surrounding SARS-CoV-2 infections in T2DM patients.

34077795	The progress of chemokines and chemokine receptors in autism spectrum disorders. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders and the main symptoms of ASD are impairments in social communication and abnormal behavioral patterns. Studies have shown that immune dysfunction and neuroinflammation play a key role in ASD patients and experimental models. Chemokines are groups of small proteins that regulate cell migration and mediate inflammation responses via binding to chemokine receptors. Thus, chemokines/chemokine receptors may be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders and associated with ASD. In this review, we summarize the research progress of chemokine aberrations in ASD and also review the recent progress of clinical treatment of ASD and pharmacological research related to chemokines/chemokine receptors. This review highlights the possible connection between chemokines/chemokine receptors and ASD, and provides novel potential targets for drug discovery of ASD.	Mechanism;Treatment
34209110	Identification of 13 Guanidinobenzoyl- or Aminidinobenzoyl-Containing Drugs to Potentially Inhibit TMPRSS2 for COVID-19 Treatment. Positively charged groups that mimic arginine or lysine in a natural substrate of trypsin are necessary for drugs to inhibit the trypsin-like serine protease TMPRSS2 that is involved in the viral entry and spread of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Based on this assumption, we identified a set of 13 approved or clinically investigational drugs with positively charged guanidinobenzoyl and/or aminidinobenzoyl groups, including the experimentally verified TMPRSS2 inhibitors Camostat and Nafamostat. Molecular docking using the C-I-TASSER-predicted TMPRSS2 catalytic domain model suggested that the guanidinobenzoyl or aminidinobenzoyl group in all the drugs could form putative salt bridge interactions with the side-chain carboxyl group of Asp435 located in the S1 pocket of TMPRSS2. Molecular dynamics simulations further revealed the high stability of the putative salt bridge interactions over long-time (100 ns) simulations. The molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area-binding free energy assessment and per-residue energy decomposition analysis also supported the strong binding interactions between TMPRSS2 and the proposed drugs. These results suggest that the proposed compounds, in addition to Camostat and Nafamostat, could be effective TMPRSS2 inhibitors for COVID-19 treatment by occupying the S1 pocket with the hallmark positively charged groups.

34226769	The Effect of Social Distancing on the Early Spread of the Novel Coronavirus. This article quantifies the effect of individual social distancing on the spread of the novel coronavirus. To do so, we use data on time spent by individuals on activities that would potentially expose them to crowds from the American Time Use Survey linked with state-level data on positive tests from the COVID Tracking Project. We estimate count data specifications of observed COVID-19 infections at the state level as a function of control demographic variables, and a measure of social distance that captures the amount of time individuals across the states spend in activities that potentially expose them to crowds. Parameter estimates reveal that the number of state-level novel coronavirus infections decrease with respect to our measure of individual social distance. From a practical perspective, our parameter estimates suggest that if the typical individual in a U.S. state were to spend eight hours away from crowds completely, this would translate into approximately 240,000 fewer COVID-19 infections across the states. Our results suggest that, at least in the United States, social distancing policies are effective in slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus.	Prevention
34340970	Clinical coding of long COVID in English primary care: a federated analysis of 58 million patient records in situ using OpenSAFELY. BACKGROUND: Long COVID describes new or persistent symptoms at least 4 weeks after onset of acute COVID-19. Clinical codes to describe this phenomenon were recently created. AIM: To describe the use of long-COVID codes, and variation of use by general practice, demographic variables, and over time. DESIGN AND SETTING: Population-based cohort study in English primary care. METHOD: Working on behalf of NHS England, OpenSAFELY data were used encompassing 96% of the English population between 1 February 2020 and 25 May 2021. The proportion of people with a recorded code for long COVID was measured overall and by demographic factors, electronic health record software system (EMIS or TPP), and week. RESULTS: Long COVID was recorded for 23 273 people. Coding was unevenly distributed among practices, with 26.7% of practices having never used the codes. Regional variation ranged between 20.3 per 100 000 people for East of England (95% confidence interval [CI] = 19.3 to 21.4) and 55.6 per 100 000 people in London (95% CI = 54.1 to 57.1). Coding was higher among females (52.1, 95% CI = 51.3 to 52.9) than males (28.1, 95% CI = 27.5 to 28.7), and higher among practices using EMIS (53.7, 95% CI = 52.9 to 54.4) than those using TPP (20.9, 95% CI = 20.3 to 21.4). CONCLUSION: Current recording of long COVID in primary care is very low, and variable between practices. This may reflect patients not presenting; clinicians and patients holding different diagnostic thresholds; or challenges with the design and communication of diagnostic codes. Increased awareness of diagnostic codes is recommended to facilitate research and planning of services, and also surveys with qualitative work to better evaluate clinicians' understanding of the diagnosis.

34282552	"Thyroid surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a systematic review. PURPOSE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, elective thyroid surgery is experiencing delays. The problem is that the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing. The research purposes were to systematically collect the literature data on the characteristics of those thyroid operations performed and to assess the safety/risks associated with thyroid surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We used all the procedures consistent with the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive literature in MEDLINE (PubMed) and Scopus was made using ''Thyroid'' and ""coronavirus"" as search terms. RESULTS: Of a total of 293 articles identified, 9 studies met the inclusion criteria. The total number of patients undergoing thyroid surgery was 2217. The indication for surgery was malignancy in 1347 cases (60.8%). Screening protocols varied depending on hospital protocol and maximum levels of personal protection equipment were adopted. The hospital length of stay was 2-3 days. Total thyroidectomy was chosen for 1557 patients (1557/1868, 83.4%), of which 596 procedures (596/1558, 38.3%) were combined with lymph node dissections. Cross-infections were registered in 14 cases (14/721, 1.9%), of which three (3/721, 0.4%) with severe pulmonary complications of COVID-19. 377 patients (377/1868, 20.2%) had complications after surgery, of which 285 (285/377, 75.6%) hypoparathyroidism and 71 (71/377, 18.8%) recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. CONCLUSION: The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission after thyroid surgery is relatively low. Our study could promote the restart of planned thyroid surgery due to COVID-19. Future studies are warranted to obtain more solid data about the risk of complications after thyroid surgery during the COVID-19 era."	Prevention
34347340	Environmental Contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan, China, 2020. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused high number of infections and deaths of healthcare workers globally. Distribution and possible transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital environment should be clarified. We herein collected 431 environmental (391 surface and 40 air) samples in the intensive care unit (ICU) and general wards (GWs) of three hospitals in Wuhan, China from February 21 to March 4, 2020, and detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time quantitative PCR. The viral positive rate in the contaminated areas was 17.8% (28/157) whereas there was no virus detected in the clean areas. Higher positive rate (22/59, 37.3%) was found in ICU than that in GWs (3/63, 4.8%). The surfaces of computer keyboards and mouse in the ICU were the most contaminated (8/10, 80.0%), followed by the ground (6/9, 66.7%) and outer glove (2/5, 40.0%). From 17 air samples in the contaminated areas, only one sample collected at a distance of around 30 cm from the patient was positive. Enhanced surface disinfection and hand hygiene effectively decontaminated the virus from the environment. This finding might help understand the transmission route and contamination risk of SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures in healthcare facilities.

34219992	Investigating the effect of air conditioning on the distribution and transmission of COVID-19 virus particles. The effect of indoor airflow has been confirmed on the diffusion and transmission of droplets generated when talking or sneezing by a person with a viral respiratory infection such as COVID-19. The present study to investigate the effect of airflow in an indoor environment (a classroom) on the distribution and transmission of droplets emitted from speaking and cough by an infected person. A numerical analysis to investigate the persistence and deposition of particles on the surfaces of desks and the faces of residents (teacher and students) under various scenarios, including the opening of windows. This study puts forward two types of conditions while the teacher is speaking and the cough of some students for the distribution of pathogenic particles. Computational Fluid Dynamics used to conduct the study, using the Euler-Lagrange approach to capture the transport of the particles, and the RANS equations to compute the airflow field in the classroom. The results indicate the significant effect of air conditioning and open window close to the infected person in reducing environmental pathogens. Moreover, the concentrations of virus particles increase greatly near the output; hence, the presence of people in these areas increases the risk of contracting the disease. Furthermore, when all the windows are closed, due to the low output capacity, the particles spread in all areas of the domain and increase the risk of infection. Therefore, it is recommended that the window be open in indoors environment especially the window next to the speaker.	Prevention;Transmission
34226776	War Against COVID-19: How Is National Identification Linked With the Adoption of Disease-Preventive Behaviors in China and the United States? Fighting the COVID-19 pandemic requires large numbers of citizens to adopt disease-preventive practices. We contend that national identification can mobilize and motivate people to engage in preventive behaviors to protect the collective, which in return would heighten national identification further. To test these reciprocal links, we conducted studies in two countries with diverse national tactics toward curbing the pandemic: (1) a two-wave longitudinal survey in China (Study 1, N = 1200), where a national goal to fight COVID-19 was clearly set, and (2) a five-wave longitudinal survey in the United States (Study 2, N = 1001), where the national leader, President Trump, rejected the severity of COVID-19 in its early stage. Results revealed that national identification was associated with an increase in disease-preventive behaviors in both countries in general. However, higher national identification was associated with greater trust in Trump's administration among politically conservative American participants, which then was associated with slower adoption of preventive behaviors. The reciprocal effect of disease-preventive behaviors on national identification was observed only in China. Overall, our findings suggest that although national identification may serve as a protective factor in curbing the pandemic, this beneficial effect was reduced in some political contexts.	Prevention
34204239	Decline in Motor Function during the COVID-19 Pandemic Restrictions and Its Recovery in a Child with Cerebral Palsy: A Case Report. Children with cerebral palsy (CP) experience various restrictions owing to their underdeveloped mobility. Home confinement due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic may further increase these restrictions. We report the case of a 7-year-old boy with CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System level IV) whose motor function declined during the period when physical therapy was discontinued due to lockdown, approximately four months. At the end of the home confinement, the patient's ability to maintain a sitting posture and weight-bearing capacity of the lower extremities decreased. His Gross Motor Function Measure total score also decreased from 34.5% to 31.9%. After resuming physical therapy, the patient recovered the function status seen before the discontinuation of physical therapy, but this took almost twice as long as the confinement period. We reaffirm that frequent physical therapy is crucial for maintaining motor function in non-ambulatory children with CP. As a countermeasure for the future, urgent efforts are needed for the development of telerehabilitation.	Case Report
34220307	Multi-biomarker is an early-stage predictor for progression of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread widely in the communities in many countries. Although most of the mild patients could be cured by their body's ability to self-heal, many patients quickly progressed to severe disease and had to undergo treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). Thus, it is very important to effectively predict which patients with mild disease are more likely to progress to severe disease. A total of 72 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Shandong Provincial Public Health Clinical Center and 1141 patients included in the published papers were enrolled in this study. We determined that the combination of interleukin-6 (IL-6), Neutrophil (NEUT), and Natural Killer (NK) cells had the highest prediction accuracy (with 75% sensitivity and 95% specificity) for progression of COVID-19 infection. A binomial regression equation that accounted for a multiple risk score for the combination of IL-6, NEUT, and NK was also established. The multiple risk score is a good indicator for early stratification of mild patients into risk categories, which is very important for adjusting the treatment plan and preventing death.

34362053	Hospitalisation for Drug Infusion Did Not Increase Levels of Anxiety and the Risk of Disease Relapse in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease during COVID-19 Outbreak. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, immunomodulatory therapies and hospital admission were suspected to increase the risk of infection. Nevertheless, patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) treated with intravenous (i.v.) biologics had to move to hospitals for drug infusion. We investigated the impact of hospitalisation in patients with IBD. We conducted a survey including consecutive IBD patients initially in clinical and biochemical remission treated with biologics at the end of the first lockdown period. Patients underwent the normally scheduled clinical visits, performed at hospital for i.v.-treated patients or at home for patients treated with s.c. drugs. We administered to all patients the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire and other 12 questions, specifically related to COVID-19 and its implications. A total of 189 IBD patients were recruited, 112 (59.3%) treated with i.v. drugs and 77 (40.7%) with s.c. ones. No relapses were recorded in either group (hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized, p = ns), as well as which, COVID-19 infections were not demonstrated in patients in contact with people with suspected symptoms or directly experiencing them. The total HADS score obtained by the sum of all items was also almost identical between groups (37.1 +/- 2.8 vs. 37.2 +/- 2.8; p = 0.98). In patients treated with i.v. drugs receiving a televisit (n = 17), the rate of satisfaction with telemedicine (58.8%) was significantly lower compared with those treated with s.c. drugs (94.8%; p < 0.0005). Our results suggest that hospitalisation during the COVID-19 outbreak does not increase the risk of COVID-19 infection as well as the risk of IBD relapse; moreover, the similar levels of anxiety in both groups could confirm that there is no need to convert patients from i.v. to s.c. therapy.

34290914	Clinical Outcome of COVID-19 Patients Presenting With Gastrointestinal Symptoms. Background Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) usually have fever and respiratory tract complaints; however, many report gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. The frequency of GI symptoms ranges from 16% to 61%. Although COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are related to pulmonary disease, poor outcomes have been linked to GI symptoms. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the outcomes of COVID-19 patients who presented with GI symptoms. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Isra University Hospital in Hyderabad, Pakistan, from April 2020 to October 2020. Results In total, 395 polymerase chain reaction-positive individuals were included. No differences in age or comorbidities were found. Of the 84 patients who needed intensive care unit admission, 17 had GI symptoms (P= 0.357). Moreover, GI symptoms were reported in 9/42 patients who required mechanical ventilation (P = 0.674) and 35/184 patients who required non-invasive ventilation (P = 0.029). GI symptoms were reported in 47/206 patients discharged on room air (without supplemental oxygen) (P= 0.549), 11/77 who died (P = 0.025), 2/11 who were referred elsewhere due to financial issues (P = 0.999), 7/32 who left against medical advice (P = 0.764), and 28/69 who were discharged requiring oxygen at home (P = 0.001). Conclusions Patients with GI symptoms had reduced odds of mortality, and increased odds of discharge requiring supplemental oxygen.	Diagnosis;Treatment

34224292	Disproportionate COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate among healthcare professionals on the eve of nationwide vaccine distribution in Bangladesh. BACKGROUND: : Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine by the target groups would play a crucial role in stemming the pandemic. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are the priority group for vaccination due to them having the highest risk of exposure to infection. This survey aimed to assess their acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in Bangladesh. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using an online questionnaire was conducted between January 3 to 25, 2021, among HCPs (n=834) in Bangladesh. The main outcome measures were vaccine acceptance by HCPs if one was available. RESULTS: Less than 50% of HCPs would receive the vaccine against COVID-19 if available and 54% were willing to take the vaccine at some stage in the future. Female participants (OR:1.64;95%CI:1.172-2.297), respondents between 18-34 years old (OR:2.42; 95% CI:1.314-4.463), HCPs in the public sector (OR:2.09; 95% CI:1.521-2.878), and those who did not receive a flu vaccine in the previous year (OR:3.1; 95% CI:1.552-6.001) were more likely to delay vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that, if available, less than half of the HCPs would accept a COVID-19 vaccine in Bangladesh. To ensure the broader success of the vaccination drive, tailored strategies and vaccine promotion campaigns targeting HCPs and the general population are needed.	Treatment
34218767	Time to review how injectable medicines are prepared and administered in European hospitals. It has been known, for decades, that the use of injectable medicines in European hospitals has been associated with frequent medication errors, some of which cause preventable severe harms and deaths. There have been national and European inquiries and reports concerning improving patient safety by recommending greater use of pharmacy aseptic preparation services and provision of ready-to administer injectables, which have not been widely implemented.In England experience of treating patients with COVID-19 infections has brought into focus other benefits of significantly extending pharmacy aseptic preparation services. These benefits include saving nursing time, having systems in place which have resilience and capacity, reducing variation in practice, improving clinical staff and patient experience, and enabling more injectable medicines to be administered to patients at home. It has also been recognised that more action is required to standardise policies and procedures for injectable medicines and mplement the use of smart infusion devices with dose error reduction software, to help minimise drug administration errors.Hospital pharmacists have a key role in developing these services to bring European hospitals more in line with those provided by hospital pharmacies in North America.

34334968	A fractional-order model for CoViD-19 dynamics with reinfection and the importance of quarantine. Coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among many symptoms, cough, fever and tiredness are the most common. People over 60 years old and with associated comorbidities are most likely to develop a worsening health condition. This paper proposes a non-integer order model to describe the dynamics of CoViD-19 in a standard population. The model incorporates the reinfection rate in the individuals recovered from the disease. Numerical simulations are performed for different values of the order of the fractional derivative and of reinfection rate. The results are discussed from a biological point of view.

34224196	COVID-19 response by New Zealand general surgical departments in tertiary metropolitan hospitals. BACKGROUND: Worldwide, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly challenged the delivery of healthcare. New Zealand (NZ) faced similar potential challenges despite being geographically isolated. Given the rapid change in the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals in NZ were tasked with formulating their own COVID-19 responses based on the Ministry of Health's (MoH) recommendations. METHODS: This paper evaluates how six metropolitan general surgical departments in NZ had responded to COVID-19 in terms of changes made to rosters, theatres, clinics, acute admissions as well as additional measures taken to reduce the risk of staff exposure. It also explores how NZ fared in comparison with international guidelines and recommendations. Data from each centre were provided by an appointed clinician. RESULTS: All centres had adapted new rosters and a restructuring of teams. Handovers, multidisciplinary team meetings and educational sessions were held virtually. Different strategies were implemented to ration hospital resources and reduce the risk of staff exposure. Non-urgent operations, endoscopies and clinics were deferred with allocation of dedicated COVID-19 operating theatres. Potential COVID-19 suspects were screened prior to admission and treated separately. Various admission and imaging pathways were utilised to increase efficiency. CONCLUSION: General surgical departments in NZ had implemented a comprehensive COVID-19 response but there is room to work towards a more unified national response. Our analysis shows that these centres across NZ had taken a similar approach which was aligned with international practices.	Prevention
34291385	Computational predictions for protein sequences of COVID-19 virus via machine learning algorithms. The rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic and affected more than 15 million patients reported in 27 countries. Therefore, the computational biology carrying this virus that correlates with the human population urgently needs to be understood. In this paper, the classification of the human protein sequences of COVID-19, according to the country, is presented based on machine learning algorithms. The proposed model is based on distinguishing 9238 sequences using three stages, including data preprocessing, data labeling, and classification. In the first stage, data preprocessing's function converts the amino acids of COVID-19 protein sequences into eight groups of numbers based on the amino acids' volume and dipole. It is based on the conjoint triad (CT) method. In the second stage, there are two methods for labeling data from 27 countries from 0 to 26. The first method is based on selecting one number for each country according to the code numbers of countries, while the second method is based on binary elements for each country. According to their countries, machine learning algorithms are used to discover different COVID-19 protein sequences in the last stage. The obtained results demonstrate 100% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 90% specificity via the country-based binary labeling method with a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Furthermore, with significant infection data, the USA is more prone to correct classification compared to other countries with fewer data. The unbalanced data for COVID-19 protein sequences is considered a major issue, especially as the US's available data represents 76% of a total of 9238 sequences. The proposed model will act as a prediction tool for the COVID-19 protein sequences in different countries.	Mechanism
34211601	Developmental dysplasia of the hip screening during the lockdown for COVID-19: experience from Northern Italy. Purpose: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) ultrasound screening (USS), which is usually performed in Italy as an outpatient, was halted for an indefinite period in most centres during lockdown. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of COVID-19 on DDH-USS, in two paediatric orthopaedic centres in one of the most critical areas of the western World. Methods: An academic teaching hospital and paediatric trauma centre (T) and a University hospital and DDH referral centre (H), classified as national COVID-19 hubs, were involved. Graf's method was applied in both centres. In T, paediatricians directly referred only patients with delayed DDH-USS or suspicious unstable hips; in H, paediatricians or parents could directly refer to the screening service. Results: The mean age of the 95 patients (190 hips) who were referred for DDH-USS in T, was 3.85 months (0.1 to 7.4); 175 were type I, nine were type IIa (+ and -), five type D and one type IV. In H, the screened patients in 2020 were only 78% of the same period in 2019. A total of 28 patients with 32 hips (8 IIb, 5 IIc, 8 D, 11 III) had late diagnosis at a mean age of 114 days (96 to 146). In the same period in 2019 only eight patients with 11 hips (8 IIb, 1 D, 1 III, 1 IV) at a mean age of 142 days (92 to 305) had late diagnosis. Conclusion: DDH-USS was the only screening in newborns which halted during lockdown. Few centres, which still performed diagnosis and treatment, were overloaded causing a delay in DDH management. Level of evidence: IV.	Prevention

34222436	Mesenteric ischemia in COVID-19 patients: A review of current literature. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus has affected all the systems of the body, defying all impressions of it being a respiratory virus only. AIM: To see the association of mesenteric ischemia with COVID-19. METHODS: After initial screening and filtering of the titles on PubMed and Google Scholar, 124 articles were selected. Articles were read in full, and the references were skimmed for relevance. Twenty-six articles (case reports and case series) were found to eligible for inclusion. References of these 26 articles were checked for any additional cases. Two more publications were found, and a total of 28 articles (22 case reports and 6 case series) have been included for review in this manuscript. RESULTS: A total of 41 cases of acute mesenteric ischemia in COVID-19 patients have been reported in the literature since the outbreak of this pandemic. Most of them include patients with comorbidities. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, based on this literature review and precise published knowledge regarding acute mesenteric ischemia in patients with COVID-19, it is essential to understand its relevance in all patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. The threshold for the diagnostic investigations should also be kept low for the timely diagnosis and management of this disorder.	Diagnosis
34220289	Deep learning empowered COVID-19 diagnosis using chest CT scan images for collaborative edge-cloud computing platform. The novel coronavirus outbreak has spread worldwide, causing respiratory infections in humans, leading to a huge global pandemic COVID-19. According to World Health Organization, the only way to curb this spread is by increasing the testing and isolating the infected. Meanwhile, the clinical testing currently being followed is not easily accessible and requires much time to give the results. In this scenario, remote diagnostic systems could become a handy solution. Some existing studies leverage the deep learning approach to provide an effective alternative to clinical diagnostic techniques. However, it is difficult to use such complex networks in resource constraint environments. To address this problem, we developed a fine-tuned deep learning model inspired by the architecture of the MobileNet V2 model. Moreover, the developed model is further optimized in terms of its size and complexity to make it compatible with mobile and edge devices. The results of extensive experimentation performed on a real-world dataset consisting of 2482 chest Computerized Tomography scan images strongly suggest the superiority of the developed fine-tuned deep learning model in terms of high accuracy and faster diagnosis time. The proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 96.40%, with approximately ten times shorter response time than prevailing deep learning models. Further, McNemar's statistical test results also prove the efficacy of the proposed model.	Diagnosis
34219476	COVID-19 global pandemic planning: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 fomites in a university hospital setting. As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has surged across the globe, great effort has been expended to understand mechanisms of transmission and spread. From a hospital perspective, this topic is critical to limit and prevent SARS-CoV-2 iatrogenic transmission within the healthcare environment. Currently, the virus is believed to be transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets, but a growing body of evidence suggests that spread is also possible through aerosolized particles and fomites. Amidst a growing volume of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through fomites. Samples collected from the exposed skin of clinicians (n = 42) and high-touch surfaces (n = 40) were collected before and after encounters with COVID-19 patients. Samples were analyzed using two assays: the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time Reverse Transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay, and a SYBR Green assay that targeted a 121 bp region within the S-gene of SARS-CoV-2. None of the samples tested positive with the CDC assay, while two high-touch surface areas tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using the Spike assay. However, viral culture did not reveal viable SARS-CoV-2 from the positive samples. Overall, the results from this study suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RNA were not widely present either on exposed skin flora or high-touch surface areas in the hospital locations tested. The inability to recover viable virus from samples that tested positive by the molecular assays, however, does not rule out the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through fomites.

34207394	Evaluation of Side Effects Associated with COVID-19 Vaccines in Saudi Arabia. BACKGROUND: Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca are recently introduced vaccines to combat COVID-19 pandemic. During clinical trials, mild to moderate side effects have been associated with these vaccines. Thus, we aimed to evaluate short-term post-vaccination side effects. METHODS: Cross-sectional, retrospective study using an online questionnaire was conducted among COVID-19 vaccines recipients in Saudi Arabia. General and demographic data were collected, and vaccine-associated side effects after receiving at least one dose of each vaccine were evaluated. RESULTS: Our final sample consisted of 515 participants with a median age of 26 years. Most of the study participants were female (57%). Nearly 13% of the study subjects have reported previous infections with SARS-CoV-2. Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines have been received by 75% and 25% of the study participants, respectively. Side effects associated with COVID-19 vaccines have been reported by 60% of the study subjects, and most of them reported fatigue (90%), pain at the site of the injections (85%). CONCLUSION: Side effects that are reported post Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines among our study participants are not different from those that were reported in the clinical trials, indicating safe profiles for both vaccines. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the current vaccines in protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfections.	Treatment
34348482	The MAVS Immune Recognition Pathway in Viral Infection and Sepsis. SIGNIFICANCE: It is estimated that close to 50 million cases of sepsis result in over 11 million annual fatalities worldwide. The pathognomonic feature of sepsis is a dysregulated inflammatory response arising from viral, bacterial, or fungal infections. Immune recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is a hallmark of the host immune defense to combat microbes and to prevent the progression to sepsis. MAVS is a ubiquitous adaptor protein located at the outer mitochondrial membrane, which is activated by the cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), RIG-I and MDA5, following binding of viral RNA agonists. Recent Advances: Substantial progress has been made in deciphering the activation of the MAVS pathway with its interacting proteins, down-stream signaling events (IRFs, NFkappaB) and context dependent type I/III interferon response. CRITICAL ISSUES: In the evolutionary race between pathogens and the host, viruses have developed immune evasion strategies for cleavage, degradation, or blockade of proteins in the MAVS pathway. For example, SARS-CoV-2 M protein and ORF9b protein antagonize MAVS signaling and a protective type I interferon response. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The role of MAVS as a sensor for non-viral pathogens, host cell injury and metabolic perturbations awaits better characterization in the future. New technical advances in multi-dimensional single-cell analysis and single-molecule methods will accelerate the rate of new discoveries. The ultimate goal is to manipulate MAVS activities in the form of immune-modulatory therapies to combat infections and sepsis.	Mechanism;Treatment
34366609	Dysregulated liver function in SARS-CoV-2 infection: Current understanding and perspectives. Since it was first reported in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has spread rapidly around the world to cause the ongoing pandemic. Although the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are predominantly in the respiratory system, liver enzyme abnormalities exist in around half of the cases, which indicate liver injury, and raise clinical concern. At present, there is no consensus whether the liver injury is directly caused by viral replication in the liver tissue or indirectly by the systemic inflammatory response. This review aims to summarize the clinical manifestations and to explore the underlying mechanisms of liver dysfunction in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Treatment
34292683	Role of lungs in the hemostasis system (review of literature). The lung tissue contains various hemostatic system elements, which can be released from the lungs, both under physiological and pathological conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the number of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in intensive care units worldwide. When the lungs are damaged, coagulation disorders are mediated by tissue factor (TF) - factor VIIa (F VIIa), and inhibition of this pathway completely eliminates intrapulmonary fibrin deposition. A tissue factor pathway inhibitor TFPI also contributes to pulmonary coagulationdisturbance in ARDS. Pulmonary coagulationdisturbance caused by pneumonia can worsen the damage to the lungs and thus contribute to the progression of the disease. Cytokines are the main linking factors between inflammation and changes in blood clotting and fibrinolysis. The sources of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs are probably alveolar macrophages. The activation of alveolar macrophages occurs through the nuclear factor kappa-bi (NF-kappaB), which controls thetranscription of the expression of immune response genes, cell apoptosis, which leads to the development of inflammation and autoimmune diseases as a result of direct stimulation of TF activation. Conversely,coagulation itself can affect bronchoalveolar inflammation. Coagulation leads to the formation of proteases that interact with specific cellular receptors, activating intracellular signaling pathways. The use of anticoagulant therapy, which also has an anti-inflammatory effect, perhaps one of the therapeutic targets for coronavirus infection.The difficulty here is that it seems appropriate to study anticoagulant interventions' influence on clinically significant cardio-respiratory parameters.

34219720	Supporting and Protecting People with Dementia in the COVID-19 Pandemic. We aimed to explore the awareness and preparedness of dementia caregivers and people with mild cognitive deficits on how to prevent COVID-19 infection and cope with the indirect consequences of the pandemic. A total of 139 patient-caregiver dyads received a telephone survey and 109 completed the survey. The majority of respondents reported having a moderate-to-good knowledge of the typical manifestations of COVID-19. Conversely, only few of them were informed of the atypical presentations and on how to recognize emergency warning signs. Filling the knowledge gaps on COVID-19 in the most vulnerable people may represent a significant resource to tackle the pandemic.	Prevention
34287098	A systematic review on efficacy, safety, and treatment-durability of low-dose rituximab for the treatment of Pemphigus: special focus on COVID-19 pandemic concerns. BACKGROUND: Rituximab is a FDA-approved monoclonal antibody for adults with moderate to severe potentially life-threatening pemphigus vulgaris. Recent studies have focused on assessments of efficacy and safety of low-dose rituximab (<2 gram in each cycle). METHOD: Databases were searched from 2010 to 2020 (last update: 1 June 2020). RESULT: Nine studies were entered; including180 cases (92: women, 88: men, age range: 9-83 years). The dosages of each Rituximab cycle varied between ultra-low-dose (</=500 mg for a cycle, either multiple infusions or a single infusion), low-dose (2 x 375 mg/m(2) or 2 x 500 mg) and modified-dose (3 x 375 mg/m(2) or 3 x 500 mg). The efficacy and safety of Rituximab in the studies are known by the recovery time, relapse time, and side events. According to the studies, 2 x 500 can lead to complete remission in a broad range, from 35 to 82%. These differences might be explained by different end-points and variable cumulative corticosteroid dosage after RTX administration. Although the studies showed that low dose RTX is efficient, there are some controversies regarding the choosing low-dose for severe patients. CONCLUSION: Considering the effectiveness of low-dose, intermediate dose, and ultra-low-dose protocols of Rituximab in inducing remission in pemphigus disease and considering factors such as cost of therapy, and the need to induce a minimum of immunosuppression for a minimum duration in the COVID-19 pandemic, suggested to use low-dose Rituximab protocol (2 infusions of 500 mg Rituximab: interval of 2 weeks) to induce the remission in mild-to-moderate pemphigus patients.

It addresses the physical changes that cause vascular and arterial damage to limbs, laboratory management of coagulation, and management of anticoagulation. COVID-19's relationship with deep venous thrombosis and arterial thrombosis is also emphasized. The main thromboembolic events described in the literature are illustrated with examples from our experience with COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34293641	SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibody titres after vaccination with BNT162b2 in naive and previously infected individuals. Great expectations are placed in vaccines against COVID-19 to control the pandemic. We reviewed the antibody titres in a cohort of healthcare workers (HCWs) vaccinated with BNT162b2 to assess the influence of a previous infection on them. We stratified the results according to the individual history of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and symptoms. Among 3475 HCWs the highest titres were recorded among those infected more than 6 months before vaccination, independently of symptoms, followed by those infected less than 6 months before vaccination, especially in those with symptoms, and by uninfected HCWs. Vaccination with BNT162b2 can boost immunity acquired through infection, particularly in those infected more than 6 months before vaccination.	Treatment
34223908	Support policies that foster a healthy food environment and incentivize healthy food purchases to mitigate cancer inequities. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the inequitable access to resources, leading to a disproportionate burden of disease in vulnerable communities in the USA. However, these inequities in health outcomes are not limited to COVID-19. Approximately 18% of cancers are related to dietary behaviors and excess body weight. Underserved communities, such as minority racial/ethnic groups living in neighborhoods of low socioeconomic status, experience barriers to healthy eating including lack of access to high-quality healthy foods and higher availability of unhealthy foods and beverages in local retail food outlets. Strikingly, these same populations are more likely to die from cancers related to dietary intake and obesity like colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers. To reduce cancer inequities, policy makers can act by supporting programs that incentivize healthy food purchases and improve the local food environment in underserved communities.	Prevention
34199357	Titers, Prevalence, and Duration of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in a Local COVID-19 Outbreak and Following Vaccination. Information concerning the development of neutralizing antibodies and their duration will be critical to establishing herd immunity for COVID-19. We sought to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies, their duration, and capacity for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in volunteers while the pandemic spread within our community starting in March 2020. Those participants with the highest starting titers had the longest-lasting response, up to 12 months post-diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacity was correlated with anti-RBD antibody levels. The majority of our participants with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis had very mild or asymptomatic infections. We also detected low and largely non-neutralizing anti-RBD IgG titers in a few participants with no known COVID-19 diagnosis. Finally, we found that antibody responses induced by vaccination were significantly higher than those induced by natural infection. Thus, our study suggests that vaccination is still critical even for those naturally infected or diagnosed with COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34293217	Post-SARS-CoV-2-vaccination cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: an analysis of cases notified to the European Medicines Agency. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) has been described after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The clinical characteristics of 213 post-vaccination CVST cases notified to the European Medicines Agency are reported. METHODS: Data on adverse drug reactions after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination notified until 8 April 2021 under the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Term 'Central nervous system vascular disorders' were obtained from the EudraVigilance database. Post-vaccination CVST was compared with 100 European patients with CVST from before the COVID-19 pandemic derived from the International CVST Consortium. RESULTS: In all, 213 CVST cases were identified: 187 after AstraZeneca/Oxford (ChAdOx1 nCov-19) vaccination and 26 after a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination (25 with Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b2, and one with Moderna, mRNA-1273). Thrombocytopenia was reported in 107/187 CVST cases (57%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 50%-64%) in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group, in none in the mRNA vaccine group (0%, 95% CI 0%-13%) and in 7/100 (7%, 95% CI 3%-14%) in the pre-COVID-19 group. In the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group, 39 (21%) reported COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction tests were performed within 30 days of CVST symptom onset, and all were negative. Of the 117 patients with a reported outcome in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group, 44 (38%, 95% CI 29%-47%) had died, compared to 2/10 (20%, 95% CI 6%-51%) in the mRNA vaccine group and 3/100 (3%, 95% CI 1%-8%) in the pre-COVID-19 group. Mortality amongst patients with thrombocytopenia in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group was 49% (95% CI 39%-60%). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis occurring after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination has a clinical profile distinct from CVST unrelated to vaccination. Only CVST after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination was associated with thrombocytopenia.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34362150	Correlation between the Level of Social Distancing and Activity of Influenza Epidemic or COVID-19 Pandemic: A Subway Use-Based Assessment. Social distancing is an effective measure to mitigate the spread of novel viral infections in the absence of antiviral agents and insufficient vaccine supplies. Subway utilization density may reflect social activity and the degree of social distancing in the general population.; This study aimed to evaluate the correlations between subway use density and the activity of the influenza epidemic or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic using a time-series regression method. The subway use-based social distancing score (S-SDS) was calculated using the weekly ridership of 11 major subway stations. The temporal association of S-SDS with influenza-like illness (ILI) rates or the COVID-19 pandemic activity was analyzed using structural vector autoregressive modeling and the Granger causality (GC) test. During three influenza seasons (2017-2020), the time-series regression presented a significant causality from S-SDS to ILI (p = 0.0484). During the COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020, S-SDS had been suppressed at a level similar to or below the average of the previous four years. In contrast to the ILI rate, there was a negative correlation between COVID-19 activity and S-SDS. GC analysis revealed a negative causal relationship between COVID-19 and S-SDS (p = 0.0098).; S-SDS showed a significant time-series association with the ILI rate but not with COVID-19 activity. When public transportation use is sufficiently suppressed, additional social mobility restrictions are unlikely to significantly affect COVID-19 pandemic activity. It would be more important to strengthen universal mask-wearing and detailed public health measures focused on risk activities, particularly in enclosed spaces.	Prevention
34356617	COVID-19: Unmasking Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants, Vaccines and Therapeutic Strategies. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has been a topic of major concern for global human health. The challenge to restrain the COVID-19 pandemic is further compounded by the emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants viz. B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta), which show increased transmissibility and resistance towards vaccines and therapies. Importantly, there is convincing evidence of increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals with dysregulated immune response and comorbidities. Herein, we provide a comprehensive perspective regarding vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with underlying medical comorbidities. We discuss ongoing vaccine (mRNA, protein-based, viral vector-based, etc.) and therapeutic (monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, plasma therapy, etc.) modalities designed to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss in detail, the challenges posed by different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) identified across the globe and their effects on therapeutic and prophylactic interventions.

As an emerging disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, its potential transmissibility via aerosols has caused heated debate. This work summarizes the current research findings on virus aerosol generation, aerodynamic properties, and environmental influencing factors on their survivability in order to elucidate coronavirus transmission via aerosols. The occurrence and distinction of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV in real atmospheric environments are summarized. The deficiencies of existing research and directions for necessary future research on confirming the airborne transmission mechanism of coronavirus as well as the need for multidisciplinary research are discussed.

34202678	Post-Mortem Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Long-Buried Lung Samples. The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unexpected death toll worldwide. Even though several guidelines for the management of infectious corpses have been proposed, the limited number of post-mortem analyses during the pandemic has led to inaccuracies in the counting of COVID-19 deaths and contributed to a lack of important information about the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Due to the impossibility of carrying out autopsies on all corpses, the scientific community has raised the question of whether confirmatory analyses could be performed on exhumed bodies after a long period of burial to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Post-mortem lung samples were collected from 16 patients who died from COVID-19 infection and were buried for a long period of time. A custom RNA extraction protocol was developed to enhance extraction of viral RNA from degraded samples and highly sensitive molecular methods, including RT-qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), were used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The custom extraction protocol developed allowed us to extract total RNA effectively from all lung samples collected. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was effectively detected in all samples by both RT-qPCR and ddPCR, regardless of the length of burial. ddPCR results confirmed the persistence of the virus in this anatomical niche and revealed high viral loads in some lung samples, suggesting active infection at the time of death. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the lung even after a long post-mortem interval (up to 78 days). The extraction protocol herein described, and the highly sensitive molecular analyses performed, could represent the standard procedures for SARS-CoV-2 detection in degraded lung specimens. Finally, the innovative results obtained encourage post-mortem confirmatory analyses even after a long post-mortem interval.	Diagnosis
34285035	Pleomorphic liposarcoma of the male breast: lessons from a rare malignancy during COVID-19 pandemic. A 52-year-old man presented with a recurrent right side breast lump. He had undergone excision of a lump on the right breast followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy 1 year ago for a diagnosis of pleomorphic liposarcoma. Imaging revealed a 47x36 mm lesion on the right side of the chest wall involving the pectoralis muscle. The patient underwent right radical mastectomy. Histology of the specimen showed an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma infiltrating into the underlying skeletal muscle. Therefore, he was planned for chemoradiotherapy. But due to lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, he was lost to follow-up and later presented with malignant pleural effusion. This case emphasises the impact of COVID-19 pandemic over such rare malignancies.	Case Report

Background: This was a phase 1, dose-escalation open-label trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901, a SARS-CoV-2 S-2P protein vaccine adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide and CpG 1018. Methods: Between September 28 and November 13 2020, 77 participants were screened. Of these, 45 healthy adults from 20 to 49 years of age were to be administered two doses of MVC-COV1901 in doses of 5 mug, 15 mug, or 25 mug of spike protein at 28 days apart. There were 15 participants in each dose group; all were followed for 28 days after the second dose at the time of the interim analysis. Adverse events and laboratory data were recorded for the safety evaluation. Blood samples were collected for humoral, and cellular immune response at various time points. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04487210. Findings: Solicited adverse events were mostly mild and similar. No subject experienced fever. After the second dose, the geometric mean titers (GMTs) for SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific immunoglobulin G were 7178.2, 7746.1, 11,220.6 in the 5 mug, 15 mug, and 25 mug dose groups, respectively. The neutralizing activity were detected in both methods. (Day 43 GMTs, 538.5, 993.1, and 1905.8 for pseudovirus; and 33.3, 76.3, and 167.4 for wild-type virus). The cellular immune response induced by MVC-COV1901 demonstrated substantially higher numbers of IFN-gamma- producing cells, suggesting a Th1-skewed immune response. Interpretation: The MVC-COV1901 vaccine was well tolerated and elicited robust immune responses and is suitable for further development. Funding: Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation.	Treatment
34208878	Learning from and Leveraging Multi-Level Changes in Responses to the COVID 19 Pandemic to Facilitate Breast Cancer Prevention Efforts. The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has had multilevel effects on non-COVID-19 health and health care, including deferral of routine cancer prevention and screening and delays in surgical and other procedures. Health and health care use has also been affected by pandemic-related loss of employer-based health insurance, food and housing disruptions, and heightened stress, sleep disruptions and social isolation. These disruptions are projected to contribute to excess non-COVID-19 deaths over the coming decades. At the same time municipalities, health systems and individuals are making changes in response to the pandemic, including modifications in the environmental to promote health, implementation of telehealth platforms, and shifts towards greater self-care and using remote platforms to maintain social connections. We used a multi-level biopsychosocial model to examine the available literature on the relationship between COVID-19-related changes and breast cancer prevention to identify current gaps in knowledge and identify potential opportunities for future research. We found that COVID-19 has impacted several aspects of social and economic life, through a variety of mechanisms, including unemployment, changes in health care delivery, changes in eating and activity, and changes in mental health. Some of these changes should be reduced, while others should be explored and enhanced.	Prevention
34359926	Antiviral Activity of Influenza A Virus Defective Interfering Particles against SARS-CoV-2 Replication In Vitro through Stimulation of Innate Immunity. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in late 2019 and resulted in a devastating pandemic. Although the first approved vaccines were already administered by the end of 2020, worldwide vaccine availability is still limited. Moreover, immune escape variants of the virus are emerging against which the current vaccines may confer only limited protection. Further, existing antivirals and treatment options against COVID-19 show only limited efficacy. Influenza A virus (IAV) defective interfering particles (DIPs) were previously proposed not only for antiviral treatment of the influenza disease but also for pan-specific treatment of interferon (IFN)-sensitive respiratory virus infections. To investigate the applicability of IAV DIPs as an antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19, we conducted in vitro co-infection experiments with cell culture-derived DIPs and the IFN-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells. We show that treatment with IAV DIPs leads to complete abrogation of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was dependent on janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. Further, our results suggest boosting of IFN-induced antiviral activity by IAV DIPs as a major contributor in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, we propose IAV DIPs as an effective antiviral agent for treatment of COVID-19, and potentially also for suppressing the replication of new variants of SARS-CoV-2.	Mechanism;Treatment
34222675	Establishment of a novel triage system for SARS-CoV-2 among trauma victims in trauma centers with limited facilities. Objectives: The triage of trauma patients with potential COVID-19 remains a major challenge given that a significant number of patients may be asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. This study aimed to compare the specificity and sensitivity of available triage systems for COVID-19 among trauma patients. Furthermore, it aimed to develop a novel triage system for SARS-CoV-2 detection among trauma patients in centers with limited resources. Methods: All patients referred to our center from February to May 2020 were enrolled in this prospective study. We evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 triage protocols from the WHO, the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME), and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) for their effectiveness in finding COVID-19 infected individuals among trauma patients. We then used these data to design a stepwise triage protocol to detect COVID-19 positive patients among trauma patients. Results: According to our findings, the WHO protocol showed 100% specificity and 13.3% sensitivity. The MOHME protocol had 99% specificity and 23.3% sensitivity. While the ECDC protocol showed 93.3% sensitivity and 89.5% specificity, it did not prioritize patients based on traumatic injuries and unstable conditions. Our stepwise triage protocol, which prioritizes traumatic injuries, had 93.3% sensitivity and 90.3% specificity. Conclusion: Our study shows that the triage protocols from the WHO, MOHME and ECDC are not best equipped to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals among trauma patients. In our proposed stepwise triage system, patients are triaged according to their hemodynamic conditions, COVID-19 related clinical states, and COVID-19 related laboratory findings. Our triage model can lead to more accurate and resource-effective management of trauma patients with potential COVID-19 infection. Level of evidence: Level .	Diagnosis
34213728	In silico analysis and identification of antiviral coumarin derivatives against 3-chymotrypsin-like main protease of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic viral disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that generated serious damages for both the human population and the global economy. Therefore, it is currently considered as one of the most important global health problems of human societies and there is an urgent need for potent drugs or vaccines which can effectively combat this virus. The chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role in the viral replication inside the host and thus is a promising drug target to design and develop effective antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronaviruses. This study evaluated some antiviral coumarin phytochemicals as potential inhibitors of coronaviruses 3CLpro by in silico approaches such as molecular docking, ADMET prediction, molecular dynamics simulation, and MM-PBSA binding energy calculation. Natural coumarin derivatives were docked to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and for further investigation, docked to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The docking scores of these natural compounds were compared with 3CLpro referenced inhibitors (ritonavir and lopinavir) and co-crystal inhibitor N3. Molecular docking studies suggested more than half of the coumarin phytochemicals had favorable interaction at the binding pocket of the coronaviruses 3CLpro and exhibited better binding affinities toward 3CLpro than ritonavir and lopinavir. Most antiviral phytochemicals interact strongly with one or both the catalytic dyad residues (His41 and Cys145) and the other key residues of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Further, MD simulation and binding free energy calculations using MM-PBSA were carried out for three 3CLpro-coumarin complexes and 3CLpro-N3/lopinavir. The results confirmed that the 3CLpro-glycycoumarin, 3CLpro-oxypeucedanin hydrate, and 3CLpro-inophyllum P complexes were highly stable, experience fewer conformation fluctuations and share a similar degree of compactness. Also, the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness studies showed good results for the selected coumarin phytochemicals.Therefore, the coumarin phytochemicals could be used as antiviral agents in the treatment of COVID-19 after further studies.

34201926	Coronaviruses in Bats: A Review for the Americas. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is the focus of attention as it has caused more than three million human deaths globally. This and other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, have been suggested to be related to coronaviruses that are hosted in bats. This work shows, through a bibliographic review, the frequency of detection of coronavirus in bats species of the Americas. The presence of coronavirus in bats has been examined in 25 investigations in 11 countries of the Americas between 2007 and 2020. Coronaviruses have been explored in 9371 individuals from 160 species of bats, and 187 coronavirus sequences have been deposited in GenBank distributed in 43 species of bats. While 91% of the coronaviruses sequences identified infect a single species of bat, the remainder show a change of host, dominating the intragenera change. So far, only Mex-CoV-6 is related to MERS-CoV, a coronavirus pathogenic for humans, so further coronavirus research effort in yet unexplored bat species is warranted.	Mechanism;Diagnosis;Transmission

Purpose: To detail the rationale behind recommendations recently published by the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) outlining best practices for safety of vitreoretinal surgeons and staff while performing vitreoretinal surgery during the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic. Methods: The committee for ASRS Best Practices for Retinal Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic reviewed existing evidence and information on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and risk factors during vitreoretinal surgery. Recommendations were based on best available published data, cumulative clinical experiences, and recommendations and policies from other organizations. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the strength of recommendations and confidence in the evidence. These serve as interim recommendations which are routinely updated given gaps of knowledge and lack of high-quality data on this evolving subject. Results: Relevant existing literature related to methods of transmission, and ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. The data and clinical experiences driving recommendations for pre-operative, intraoperative and post-operative surgical considerations, anesthesia choice, as well as considerations for intravitreal injections are provided. Conclusion: Recommendations are provided with the goal of protecting vitreoretinal surgeons and associated personnel from exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during interventional vitreoretinal procedures. This is a rapidly evolving topic with numerous remaining gaps in our current knowledge. As such, recommendations will evolve and the current manuscript is intended to serve as a foundation for continued dialogue on best practices.	Prevention
34215453	Relationship between pre-existing allergies and anaphylactic reactions post mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administration. Two mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, are approved for emergency use in the United States. After their approval and dosing in millions of recipients, reports of anaphylaxis began to appear in the Vaccine Adverse Reporting System (VAERS). Here we provide an analysis of the relationship between prior history of allergy and/or anaphylaxis and anaphylaxis rates following the administration of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Overall reported incidence of anaphylaxis was estimated to be rare at 4.2 cases per million doses. It appeared that the relative incidence of anaphylaxis following administration of these COVID-19 vaccines was two and seven times higher for recipients with a prior history of allergies and/or anaphylaxis, respectively. This report provides valuable metrics to make evidence-based decisions for subjects with pre-existing allergic conditions receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.	Treatment
34222851	Major cardiac concerns in therapy and vaccinations for COVID-19. The necessity and impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the world's health have led to the development and production of practical and useful vaccines for this deadly respiratory virus. Since April 2020, a vaccine for the virus has been developed. Given that comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease are more prone to viruses and the risk of infection, vaccines should be designed to protect against high-risk respiratory illnesses. In this review, we discussed the cardiovascular alteration in SARS-CoV-2 treatment, and we also reviewed the vaccination information and studies that have been done to primary considerations for cardiac patients.

34228712	Detection of significant antiviral drug effects on COVID-19 with reasonable sample sizes in randomized controlled trials: A modeling study. BACKGROUND: Development of an effective antiviral drug for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health priority. Although several candidate drugs have been identified through in vitro and in vivo models, consistent and compelling evidence from clinical studies is limited. The lack of evidence from clinical trials may stem in part from the imperfect design of the trials. We investigated how clinical trials for antivirals need to be designed, especially focusing on the sample size in randomized controlled trials. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A modeling study was conducted to help understand the reasons behind inconsistent clinical trial findings and to design better clinical trials. We first analyzed longitudinal viral load data for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) without antiviral treatment by use of a within-host virus dynamics model. The fitted viral load was categorized into 3 different groups by a clustering approach. Comparison of the estimated parameters showed that the 3 distinct groups were characterized by different virus decay rates (p-value < 0.001). The mean decay rates were 1.17 d-1 (95% CI: 1.06 to 1.27 d-1), 0.777 d-1 (0.716 to 0.838 d-1), and 0.450 d-1 (0.378 to 0.522 d-1) for the 3 groups, respectively. Such heterogeneity in virus dynamics could be a confounding variable if it is associated with treatment allocation in compassionate use programs (i.e., observational studies). Subsequently, we mimicked randomized controlled trials of antivirals by simulation. An antiviral effect causing a 95% to 99% reduction in viral replication was added to the model. To be realistic, we assumed that randomization and treatment are initiated with some time lag after symptom onset. Using the duration of virus shedding as an outcome, the sample size to detect a statistically significant mean difference between the treatment and placebo groups (1:1 allocation) was 13,603 and 11,670 (when the antiviral effect was 95% and 99%, respectively) per group if all patients are enrolled regardless of timing of randomization. The sample size was reduced to 584 and 458 (when the antiviral effect was 95% and 99%, respectively) if only patients who are treated within 1 day of symptom onset are enrolled. We confirmed the sample size was similarly reduced when using cumulative viral load in log scale as an outcome. We used a conventional virus dynamics model, which may not fully reflect the detailed mechanisms of viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. The model needs to be calibrated in terms of both parameter settings and model structure, which would yield more reliable sample size calculation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that estimated association in observational studies can be biased due to large heterogeneity in viral dynamics among infected individuals, and statistically significant effect in randomized controlled trials may be difficult to be detected due to small sample size. The sample size can be dramatically reduced by recruiting patients immediately after developing symptoms. We believe this is the first study investigated the study design of clinical trials for antiviral treatment using the viral dynamics model.	Treatment
34291022	Weight Status and Body Composition Dynamics in Children and Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Introduction: The preventive measures taken in attempt to prevent COVID-19 spread lead to closure of schools and leisure time activities. The impact of the pandemic on pediatric weight status is unclear, reports from around the world predict grave consequences with increasing obesity. We aimed to examine the change in body composition parameters of children and adolescents during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: An observational study of 220 pediatric subjects (109 boys; mean current age 11.8 +/- 3.3 years; 37 with underweight, 123 with normal weight, and 60 with overweight/obesity) who underwent height and body composition measurements by bioelectrical impedance analysis, Tanita MC-780MA, GMON Professional Software before and during the pandemic. Height, body mass index (BMI) and muscle-to-fat ratio (MFR) z-scores were calculated. Data collected from the participants' medical files included home address for socioeconomic position calculation, pubertal stage, and self-reported sleep duration and physical activity performance. Results: The vast majority of the cohort (81.8%) had stable or improved MFR z-scores during the pandemic. MFR z-scores significantly increased in subjects with underweight (p = 0.05) and normal weight (p = 0.008), but not in subjects with overweight/obesity (p = 0.169). There were significant associations in BMI z-scores (r = 0.961, p < 0.001) and MFR z-scores (r = 0.854, p < 0.001) before and during the pandemic. A multivariate linear regression model identified socioeconomic position, pre-pandemic BMI z-scores, pre-pandemic MFR z-scores, and physical activity levels during the pandemic as predictors for delta MFR z-scores (F = 12.267, p < 0.001). Age, sex, pre-pandemic physical activity, and the time that had elapsed between initiation of the first nationwide lockdown and the BIA assessment during the pandemic did not emerge as predictors for delta MFR z-score. Conclusions: Our encouraging findings demonstrate improvement in body composition parameters of subjects with underweight and normal weight and stability in subjects with overweight/obesity. Engagement in physical activity during the pandemic predicted improvement, while lower socioeconomic position predicted deterioration.	Prevention
34200327	Green Tea Polyphenol Catechins Inhibit Coronavirus Replication and Potentiate the Adaptive Immunity and Autophagy-Dependent Protective Mechanism to Improve Acute Lung Injury in Mice. Effective antiviral therapeutics are urgently required to fight severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Because polyphenol catechins could confer antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antimicrobial activities, we assessed the therapeutic effects of catechins against SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells, the preventive effect of catechins on CD25/CD69/CD94/CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes-mediated adaptive immunity, and the protective effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. We found that catechins containing 32.8% epigallocatechin gallate, 15.2% epicatechin gallate, 13.2 epicatechin, 10.8% epigallocatechin, 10.4% gallocatechin, and 4.4% catechin directly inhibited SARS-CoV replication at sub-micromolecular concentrations. Four-week catechins ingestion increased CD8(+) T cell percentage, upregulated CD69(+)/CD25(+)/CD94-NKG2A/CD8(+) T lymphocytes-mediated adaptive immunity, and increased type I cytokines release responding to ovalbumin/alum. Catechins significantly reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine storm and oxidative stress and ALI by inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling to upregulate Beclin-1/Atg5-Atg12/LC3-II-mediated autophagy mechanism. Pretreatment of autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine reversed the inhibiting effects of catechins on the cytokines and oxidative stress levels and ALI. In conclusion, our data indicated that catechins directly inhibited SARS-CoV replication, potentiated the CD25/CD69/CD94/CD8(+) T lymphocytes-mediated adaptive immunity and attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI and cytokine storm by PI3K/AKT/mTOR-signaling-mediated autophagy, which may be applied to prevent and/or treat SARS-CoV infection.

34133825	Myopericarditis in a previously healthy adolescent male following COVID-19 vaccination: A case report. We report the case of a previously healthy 16-year-old male who developed myopericarditis following the second dose of his Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, with no other identified triggers. Adolescents and young adults experiencing chest pain after COVD-19 vaccination should seek emergent medical care, and emergency providers should have a low threshold to consider and evaluate for myopericarditis. More data are needed to better understand the potential association between COVID-19 vaccines and myopericarditis. If a true causal link is identified, the risk must also be viewed in context with the millions of patients who have been safely vaccinated and the known morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection. As we see widespread vaccine rollout, it is important that all potential adverse reactions are reported as we continue to monitor for more rare but potentially serious side effects not identified in vaccination trials.

34287202	Challenges for pregnant women seeking institutional care during the COVID-19 lockdown in India: A content analysis of online news reports. India's nationwide lockdown to curtail the transmission of Covid-19 has given rise to concerns over the health system's response to maternal and child health (MCH) services. This paper aims to understand the challenges faced by pregnant women seeking institutional care during the lockdown. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of 54 online news reports, published in English and Hindi, between 25 March 2020 and 31 May 2020. They covered cases across 17 states in India and 16 maternal deaths. Three broad thematic categories of challenges for pregnant women emerged from the analysis: 1) physical access to health facilities, 2) admission to health facilities, and 3) lack of respectful maternity care during the lockdown. In conclusion, strengthening health systems and incorporating MCH into the Covid-19 response is imperative. Failure to provide quality MCH services during the lockdown has implications for the continuum of women's care, maternal mortality, and human rights.	Prevention
34342366	Comparability of six different immunoassays measuring SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with neutralising antibody levels in convalescent plasma: from utility to prediction. BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy for COVID-19 provides virus neutralising antibodies that may ameliorate the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The effectiveness of CP likely depends on its antiviral neutralising potency and is determined using in vitro neutralising antibody assays. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated abilities of three immunoassays for anti-spike antibodies (EUROimmun, Ortho, Roche), a pseudotype-based neutralisation assay and two assays that quantify ACE2 binding of spike protein (GenScript and haemagglutination-based HAT assay) to predict neutralising antibody titres in 113 convalescent plasma donations. Assay outputs were analysed through linear regression and calculation of sensitivities and specificities by ROC analysis. RESULTS: Median values of plasma samples containing neutralising antibodies produced conversion factors for assay unitage of x6.5 (pseudotype), x19 (GenScript), x3.4 (HAT assay), x0.08 (EUROimmun), x1.64 (Roche) and x0.10 (Ortho). All selected assays were sufficient in identifying the high titre donations based on ROC analysis; area over curve ranged from 91.7% for HAT and GenScript assay to 95.6% for pseudotype assay. However, their ability to predict the actual neutralising antibody levels varied substantially as shown by linear regression correlation values (from 0.27 for Ortho to 0.61 for pseudotype assay). DISCUSSION: Combined, the study data demonstrates that all selected assays were effective in identifying donations with high neutralising antibody levels and are potentially suitable as surrogate assays for donation selection for convalescent plasma therapy.

34211540	Acute upper limb arterial ischemia in patients diagnosed with COVID-19: case series. Infection by coronavirus 2, cause of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in humans, was detected for the first time in Wuhan, China, in 2019, and spread globally over the course of 2020. Its different clinical manifestations are challenging, with a wide spectrum of presentations, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe forms that can result in death. The objective of this study is to describe a series of four cases of acute arterial ischemia involving the upper limbs in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, which were managed clinically with anticoagulation, platelet antiaggregation, and prostanoids. Two patients were discharged from hospital with regression and delimitation of the ischemic zone, without needing surgical intervention, while two patients died from pulmonary complications. Adequate understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease could support better clinical management of its complications.	Case Report
34368429	"Emergency Department Patient Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Emergency department (ED) utilization changed notably during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States. The purpose of the study was to gain a more thorough understanding of ED patient experience during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study used the consensual qualitative approach to analyze open-ended responses from post-ED patient experience surveys from February through July 2020. Comments were included in the analysis if they pertained to care during the pandemic (eg, mentioned ""the virus,"" ""masks,"" ""PPE""). A total of 242 COVID-specific comments from 192 unique patients were analyzed (median age 49 years; 69% female). Six themes were identified: visually observed changes, experiences of process changes, expressions of understanding or appreciation, sense of security, COVID-19 disease-specific comments, and ""classic"" satisfaction comments that align with previous literature on patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health care systems across the world in unique and unprecedented ways. This study identified six themes that better elucidate ED patient experience during an unprecedented public health crisis."	Prevention
34368752	Epidemiological and spatio-temporal characteristics of COVID-19 in Rwanda. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has taken millions of lives and disrupted living standards at individual, societal, and worldwide levels, causing serious consequences globally. Understanding its epidemic curve and spatio-temporal dynamics is crucial for the development of effective public health plans and responses and the allocation of resources. Thus, we conducted this study to assess the epidemiological dynamics and spatio-temporal patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic in Rwanda. Methods: Using the surveillance package in R software version 4.0.2, we implemented endemic-epidemic multivariate time series models for infectious diseases to analyze COVID-19 data reported by Rwanda Biomedical Center under the Ministry of Health from March 15, 2020 to January 15, 2021. Results: The COVID-19 pandemic occurred in two waves in Rwanda and showed a heterogenous spatial distribution across districts. The Rwandan government responded effectively and efficiently through the implementation of various health measures and intervention policies to drastically reduce the transmission of the disease. Analysis of the three components of the model showed that the most affected districts displayed epidemic components within the area, whereas the effect of epidemic components from spatial neighbors were experienced by the districts that surround the most affected districts. The infection followed the disease endemic trend in other districts. Conclusion: The epidemiological and spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19 in Rwanda show that the implementation of measures and interventions contributed significantly to the decrease in COVID-19 transmission within and between districts. This accentuates the critical call for continued intra- and inter- organization and community engagement nationwide to ensure effective and efficient response to the pandemic.	Prevention

34288747	Review of a paediatric inflammatory bowel disease service during the pandemic and the impact of the CNS role. BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing and remitting condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted provision of medical care across the world. IBD clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) played a pivotal role in the care of children with IBD during the pandemic national lockdown and in the recovery phase. This article aims to look at the impact of COVID-19 on the paediatric IBD service in one children's hospital and the effect on the IBD CNSs' workload. METHOD: A retrospective review of clinical notes and the service's IBD database from January 2019 to September 2020. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the number of email and telephone contacts to the IBD CNS team during lockdown. There was an increase in virtual clinics, and an increase in new IBD patients coming to the service, but a reduction in the number of face-to-face consultant clinics. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has disrupted medical services to children with IBD and led to a reduction in face-to-face activities but has also led to a significant increase in virtual activities. CNSs have taken up a wider role to cover patient care during a time of both medical and nursing redeployment.	Prevention
34344771	Preterm birth and stillbirth rates during the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based cohort study. BACKGROUND: Conflicting reports have emerged for rates of preterm births and stillbirths during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of these reports did not account for natural variation in these rates. We aimed to evaluate variations in preterm birth and stillbirth rates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked population health administrative databases of pregnant people giving birth in any hospital in Ontario between July 2002 and December 2020. We calculated preterm birth and stillbirth rates. We assessed preterm birth at 22-28, 29-32 and 33-36 weeks' gestation, and stillbirths at term and preterm gestation. We used Laney control P' charts for the 18-year study period (6-mo observation periods) and interrupted time-series analyses for monthly rates for the most recent 4 years. RESULTS: We evaluated 2 465 387 pregnancies, including 13 781 that resulted in stillbirth. The mean preterm birth rate for our cohort was 7.96% (range 7.32%-8.59%). From January to December 2020, we determined that the preterm birth rate in Ontario was 7.87%, with no special cause variation. The mean stillbirth rate for the cohort was 0.56% (range 0.48%-0.70%). From January to December 2020, the stillbirth rate was 0.53%, with no special cause variation. We did not find any special cause variation for preterm birth or stillbirth subgroups. We found no changes in slope or gap between prepandemic and pandemic periods using interrupted time-series analyses. INTERPRETATION: In Ontario, Canada, we found no special cause variation (unusual change) in preterm birth or stillbirth rates, overall or by subgroups, during the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the previous 17.5 years.

34205401	Detection of COVID-19 Virus on Surfaces Using Photonics: Challenges and Perspectives. The propagation of viruses has become a global threat as proven through the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, the quick detection of viral diseases and infections could be necessary. This study aims to develop a framework for virus diagnoses based on integrating photonics technology with artificial intelligence to enhance healthcare in public areas, marketplaces, hospitals, and airfields due to the distinct spectral signatures from lasers' effectiveness in the classification and monitoring of viruses. However, providing insights into the technical aspect also helps researchers identify the possibilities and difficulties in this field. The contents of this study were collected from six authoritative databases: Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar. This review includes an analysis and summary of laser techniques to diagnose COVID-19 such as fluorescence methods, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, surface plasmon resonance, and integration of Raman scattering with SPR techniques. Finally, we select the best strategies that could potentially be the most effective methods of reducing epidemic spreading and improving healthcare in the environment.	Diagnosis
34336948	Review of COVID-19 Myocarditis in Competitive Athletes: Legitimate Concern or Fake News? Since the first reported case of COVID-19 in December 2019, the global landscape has shifted toward an unrecognizable paradigm. The sports world has not been immune to these ramifications; all major sports leagues have had abbreviated seasons, fan attendance has been eradicated, and athletes have opted out of entire seasons. For these athletes, cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 are particularly concerning, as myocarditis has been implicated in a significant portion of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in athletes (up to 22%). Multiple studies have attempted to evaluate post-COVID myocarditis and develop consensus return-to-play (RTP) guidelines, which has led to conflicting information for internists and primary care doctors advising these athletes. We aim to review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of viral myocarditis, discuss the heterogeneity regarding incidence of COVID myocarditis among athletes, and summarize the current expert recommendations for RTP. The goal is to provide guidance for practitioners who will be managing and advising athletes in the COVID era.	Diagnosis
34226876	Safety practices for in-office laryngology procedures during clinical reintroduction amidst COVID-19. Objective: Describe safety practices for performing in-office laryngology procedures during clinical re-introduction amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: An anonymous survey in Qualtrics was created to evaluate demographics, preprocedure testing, practice settings, anesthesia, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use for five procedure categories (non-mucosal-traversing injections, mucosal-traversing injections, endoscopy without suction, endoscopy with suction/mucosal intervention via working channel, and laser via working channel). The survey was emailed to the Fall Voice Community on Doc Matter and to members of the American Broncho-Esophagological Association (ABEA) from May to June 2020. Results: Eighty-two respondents were analyzed (response rate: 10%). Respondents represented diverse locations, including international. Most reported academic (71%) or private practices (16%), laryngology fellowship training (76%), and a significant practice devotion to laryngology and broncho-esophagology. During the early re-introduction, most continued to perform all procedure categories. The office was preferred to the OR setting for most, though 36% preferred the OR for laser procedures. There was a preference for preprocedural SARS-Cov2 testing for procedures involving a working channel (>67%), and these procedures had the highest proportion of respondents discontinuing the procedure due to COVID-19. Various types of topical anesthesia were reported, including nebulizer treatments. The most common forms of personal protective equipment utilized were gloves (>95%) and N95 masks (>67%). Powered-air purifying respirators and general surgical masks were used infrequently. Conclusions: During the early re-introduction, respondents reported generally continuing to perform office laryngology procedures, while greater mucosal manipulation affected decisions to stop procedures due to COVID-19, perform preprocedural SARS-Cov2 testing, and alter topical anesthesia. Gloves and N95 masks were the predominate PPE. Level of Evidence: N/A.	Prevention
34285823	Diagnosis of Anosmia and Hyposmia: A Systematic Review. Background: Anosmia and hyposmia have many etiologies, including trauma, chronic sinusitis, neoplasms, and respiratory viral infections such as rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to systematically review the literature on the diagnostic evaluation of anosmia/hyposmia. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for articles published since January 1990 using terms combined with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). We included articles evaluating diagnostic modalities for anosmia, written in the English language, used original data, and had two or more patients. Results: A total of 2065 unique titles were returned upon the initial search. Of these, 226 abstracts were examined, yielding 27 full-text articles meeting inclusion criteria (Level of evidence ranging from 1 to 4; most level 2). The studies included a total of 13,577 patients. The most utilized diagnostic tools were orthonasal smell tests (such as the Sniffin' Sticks and the UPSIT, along with validated abridged smell tests). Though various imaging modalities (including MRI and CT) were frequently mentioned in the workup of olfactory dysfunction, routine imaging was not used to primarily diagnose smell loss. Conclusion: The literature includes several studies on validity and reliability for various smell tests in diagnosing anosmia. Along with a thorough history and physical, validated orthonasal smell tests should be part of the workup of the patient with suspected olfactory dysfunction. The most widely studied modality was MRI, but criteria for the timing and sequence of imaging modalities was heterogenous.	Diagnosis
34367930	Hypotheses and facts for genetic factors related to severe COVID-19. Genome-wide association analysis allows the identification of potential candidate genes involved in the development of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hence, it seems that genetics matters here, as well. Nevertheless, the virus's nature, including its RNA structure, determines the rate of mutations leading to new viral strains with all epidemiological and clinical consequences. Given these observations, we herein comment on the current hypotheses about the possible role of the genes in association with COVID-19 severity. We discuss some of the major candidate genes that have been identified as potential genetic factors associated with the COVID-19 severity and infection susceptibility: HLA, ABO, ACE2, TLR7, ApoE, TYK2, OAS, DPP9, IFNAR2, CCR2, etc. Further study of genes and genetic variants will be of great benefit for the prevention and assessment of the individual risk and disease severity in different populations. These scientific data will serve as a basis for the development of clinically applicable diagnostic and prognostic tests for patients at high risk of COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34288227	Comparison of electrocardiograms (ECG) waveforms and centralized ECG measurements between a simple 6-lead mobile ECG device and a standard 12-lead ECG. BACKGROUND: Interval duration measurements (IDMs) were compared between standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and 6-lead ECGs recorded with AliveCor's KardiaMobile 6L, a hand-held mobile device designed for use by patients at home. METHODS: Electrocardiograms were recorded within, on average, 15 min from 705 patients in Mayo Clinic's Windland Smith Rice Genetic Heart Rhythm Clinic. Interpretable 12-lead and 6-lead recordings were available for 685 out of 705 (97%) eligible patients. The most common diagnosis was congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS, 343/685 [50%]), followed by unaffected relatives and patients (146/685 [21%]), and patients with other genetic heart diseases, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (36 [5.2%]), arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (23 [3.4%]), and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (14 [2.0%]). IDMs were performed by a central ECG laboratory using lead II with a semi-automated technique. RESULTS: Despite differences in patient position (supine for 12-lead ECGs and sitting for 6-lead ECGs), mean IDMs were comparable, with mean values for the 12-lead and 6-lead ECGs for QTcF, heart rate, PR, and QRS differing by 2.6 ms, -5.5 beats per minute, 1.0 and 1.2 ms, respectively. Despite a modest difference in heart rate, intervals were close enough to allow a detection of clinically meaningful abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: The 6-lead hand-held device is potentially useful for a clinical follow-up of remote patients, and for a safety follow-up of patients participating in clinical trials who cannot visit the investigational site. This technology may extend the use of 12-lead ECG recordings during the current COVID-19 pandemic as remote patient monitoring becomes more common in virtual or hybrid-design clinical studies.

34282816	Immunoassay of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins using novel red emission-enhanced carbon dot-based silica spheres. It is imminent to develop a new type of rapid COVID-19 detection method with high sensitivity. Here, we used novel red emission-enhanced carbon dot (CD)-based silica (RCS) spheres as the signals of lateral flow immunochromatography (LFI) to ultrasensitively detect novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleocapsid proteins (SARS-CoV-2 NPs). The red emission of CDs can be enhanced and enriched in silica spheres by a simple way. The amino ends of the N-beta-(aminoethyl)-gamma-aminopropyltrimethoxy anchor carboxyl-rich CDs and enhance the red emission, while the other end is embedded in the silica carrier. Then, the composite silica spheres werecoated with 3-(triethylsilyl) propylamine to protect the CDs, promote bioconjugation and obtain RCS spheres. The optimal emission peaks of the aqueous solution and the solid state of RCS spheres were at 634 nm and 638 nm, respectively, with quantum yields (QYs) of 48.5% and 35.7%, respectively. Their red emission has a wide excitation range (from the ultraviolet region to the red region), and the best excitation wavelength is about 580 nm. Two fluorescence detection modes of the RCS-LFI technology for the SARS-CoV-2 NP assay are available: the simple mode of observation under ultraviolet light has a sensitivity of 100 pg mL-1; the advanced mode of detection under a fluorescence microscope has a sensitivity of 10 pg mL-1. This assay also exhibits the advantages of fast detection speed, high specificity, and simple operation. In addition, the feasibility of this method in actual sample detection was verified in human serum by the standard-addition method, and the results show that the method has excellent practicability. We believe that this method will be a valuable supplement for the diagnosis of COVID-19.	Diagnosis
34133062	Efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in SARS-CoV2 patients on hemodialysis. BACKGROUND: The passive immunization of patients with SARS-CoV2 with convalescent plasma (CP) is theoretically beneficial in patients with end-stage renal disease who are immunosuppressed and unable to mount an adequate immune response. Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CP in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with moderate-to-severe SARS-CoV2 infection. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted in consecutive 68 moderate-to-severe SARS-CoV2 infected patients who were on maintenance hemodialysis or with acute worsening of chronic kidney disease which required initiation of hemodialysis. Patients who received CP were compared with those who did not. The primary outcome was death during hospitalization. Clinical characteristics, duration of hospitalization and inflammatory parameters were compared between the two groups. A subgroup analysis was done to find whether early initiation of plasma was associated with better outcome. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (44%) in the plasma group and 14 (45%) patients in the control group died during hospitalization (p = 0.95). The median duration of hospitalization was 9 (6-14) days in the plasma group and 9 (6-16) in the control group (p = 0.60). There was no difference in mortality or duration of hospitalization with respect to early initiation of CP (p = 0.29). Fistula thrombosis occurred in two patients (11.1%) in the plasma group. CONCLUSION: Therapy with CP does not appear to confer any clinical benefit in moderate-to-severe SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis.	Treatment
34132421	Natural products and phytochemicals as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. The current pandemic responsible for the crippling of the health care system is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 and leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus enters into humans by attachment of its Spike protein (S) to the ACE receptor present on the lung epithelial cell surface followed by cleavage of S protein by the cellular transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2). After entry, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome is released into the cytosol, where it highjacks host replication machinery for viral replication, assemblage, as well as the release of new viral particles. The major drug targets that have been identified for SARS-CoV-2 through host-virus interaction studies include 3CLpro, PLpro, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and S proteins. Several reports of natural compounds along with synthetic products have displayed promising results and some of them are Tripterygium wilfordii, Pudilan Xiaoyan Oral Liquid, Saponin derivates, Artemisia annua, Glycyrrhiza glabra L., Jinhua Qinggan granules, Xuebijing, and Propolis. This review attempts to disclose the natural products identified as anti-SARS-CoV-2 based on in silico prediction and the effect of a variety of phytochemicals either alone and/or in combination with conventional treatments along with their possible molecular mechanisms involved for both prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 disease.

34227801	A Rolling Circle-Amplified G-Quadruplex/Hemin DNAzyme for Chemiluminescence Immunoassay of the SARS-CoV-2 Protein. Sensitive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 protein remains a great research interest in clinical screening and diagnosis owing to the coronavirus epidemic. Here, an ultrasensitive chemiluminescence (CL) imaging strategy was developed through proximity hybridization to trigger the formation of a rolling circle-amplified G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 protein. The target protein was first recognized by a pair of DNA-antibody conjugates, Ab-1 and Ab-2, to form a proximity-ligated complex, Ab-1/SARS-CoV-2/Ab-2, which contained a DNA sequence complemental to block DNA and thus induced a strand displacement reaction to release the primer from a block/primer complex. The released primer then triggered a rolling circle amplification to form abundant DNAzyme units in the presence of hemin, which produced a strong chemiluminescent signal for the detection of the target protein by catalyzing the oxidation of luminol by hydrogen peroxide. The proposed assay showed a detectable concentration range over 5 orders of magnitude with the detection limit down to 6.46 fg/mL. The excellent selectivity, simple procedure, acceptable accuracy, and intrinsic high throughput of the imaging technique for analysis of serum samples demonstrated the potential applicability of the proposed detection method in clinical screening and diagnosis.

34209188	Structure-Based Virtual Screening Reveals Ibrutinib and Zanubrutinib as Potential Repurposed Drugs against COVID-19. Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is the leading global health threat to date caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Recent clinical trials reported that the use of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors to treat COVID-19 patients could reduce dyspnea and hypoxia, thromboinflammation, hypercoagulability and improve oxygenation. However, the mechanism of action remains unclear. Thus, this study employs structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) to repurpose BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib, dasatinib, evobrutinib, fostamatinib, ibrutinib, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, spebrutinib, XL418 and zanubrutinib against SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking is conducted with BTK inhibitors against structural and nonstructural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and host targets (ACE2, TMPRSS2 and BTK). Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are then carried out on the selected complexes with high binding energy. Ibrutinib and zanubrutinib are found to be the most potent of the drugs screened based on the results of computational studies. Results further show that ibrutinib and zanubrutinib could exploit different mechanisms at the viral entry and replication stage and could be repurposed as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

34339626	Post-viral effects of COVID-19 in the olfactory system and their implications. BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which any upper respiratory virus, including SARS-CoV-2, impairs chemosensory function are not known. COVID-19 is frequently associated with olfactory dysfunction after viral infection, which provides a research opportunity to evaluate the natural course of this neurological finding. Clinical trials and prospective and histological studies of new-onset post-viral olfactory dysfunction have been limited by small sample sizes and a paucity of advanced neuroimaging data and neuropathological samples. Although data from neuropathological specimens are now available, neuroimaging of the olfactory system during the acute phase of infection is still rare due to infection control concerns and critical illness and represents a substantial gap in knowledge. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: The active replication of SARS-CoV-2 within the brain parenchyma (ie, in neurons and glia) has not been proven. Nevertheless, post-viral olfactory dysfunction can be viewed as a focal neurological deficit in patients with COVID-19. Evidence is also sparse for a direct causal relation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and abnormal brain findings at autopsy, and for trans-synaptic spread of the virus from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb. Taken together, clinical, radiological, histological, ultrastructural, and molecular data implicate inflammation, with or without infection, in either the olfactory epithelium, the olfactory bulb, or both. This inflammation leads to persistent olfactory deficits in a subset of people who have recovered from COVID-19. Neuroimaging has revealed localised inflammation in intracranial olfactory structures. To date, histopathological, ultrastructural, and molecular evidence does not suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is an obligate neuropathogen. WHERE NEXT?: The prevalence of CNS and olfactory bulb pathosis in patients with COVID-19 is not known. We postulate that, in people who have recovered from COVID-19, a chronic, recrudescent, or permanent olfactory deficit could be prognostic for an increased likelihood of neurological sequelae or neurodegenerative disorders in the long term. An inflammatory stimulus from the nasal olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulbs and connected brain regions might accelerate pathological processes and symptomatic progression of neurodegenerative disease. Persistent olfactory impairment with or without perceptual distortions (ie, parosmias or phantosmias) after SARS-CoV-2 infection could, therefore, serve as a marker to identify people with an increased long-term risk of neurological disease.

The clinical picture of the fungal disease, Pneumocystis pneumonia, resembles the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presenting a diagnostic challenge in the pandemic era. We discuss the concern of Pneumocystis jirovecii and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coinfection, their similarities, and the impact of immunosuppression, with a suggested diagnostic pathway for their suspected coinfection.

34359111	Absence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Natural Environment Exposure in Sheep in Close Contact with Humans. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the zoonotic causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has caused a pandemic situation with millions of infected humans worldwide. Among domestic animals, there have been limited studies regarding the transmissibility and exposure to the infection in natural conditions. Some animals are exposed and/or susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as cats, ferrets and dogs. By contrast, there is no information about the susceptibility of ruminants to SARS-CoV-2. This study tested the antibody response in 90 ovine pre-pandemic serum samples and 336 sheep serum samples from the pandemic period (June 2020 to March 2021). In both cases, the animals were in close contact with a veterinary student community composed of more than 700 members. None of the serum samples analyzed was seroreactive based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike antigen. In this sense, no statistical difference was observed compared to the pre-pandemic sheep. Our results suggest that it seems unlikely that sheep could play a relevant role in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is the first study to report the absence of evidence of sheep exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in natural conditions.	Transmission
34291625	Changes in the presentation of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes in children during the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary center in Southern Turkey. OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to investigate patients who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during the pandemic and evaluate the effect of the pandemic on the clinical findings of these patients by comparing them with findings from a year prior. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus between 2019 and 2021 were separated into two groups: Patients diagnosed prepandemic and those diagnosed during the pandemic. RESULTS: The number of newly diagnosed diabetes cases increased from 46 in the prepandemic period to 74 in the pandemic period. The number of cases diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the clinic increased from 58.7 to 91.9%. We found that moderate and severe DKA rates from 18.5 and 14.8% to 23.5 and 22.1%, respectively. Besides, the average HbA1c was higher, while the average bicarbonate was lower in cases diagnosed during the pandemic period compared to the prepandemic period (p=0.048 and p<0.001, respectively). We found that celiac autoantibody positivity antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti GAD) positivity, and islet cell antibodies (ICA), ICA and anti GAD positivity coexistence were higher (p=0.045, p=0.008, and p=0.007, respectively) among the patients diagnosed during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We observed an increase in the number of patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus, an increase in autoantibody positivity, and higher rates and severity of DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic period compared to the prepandemic period.

34213580	COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease: an interview-based survey. Patients with a systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (AIRD) are vulnerable to SARS Cov-2 infection. Vaccination against this infection can prevent the patients from developing severe disease. But vaccine hesitancy in this group can emerge as a hurdle. So there is a need to understand the perception regarding vaccination in AIRD patients. The study is an interview-based survey done in AIRD patients and a control group from the general population. The questionnaire included the subject's demographic details, duration, diagnosis, the activity of AIRD, and questions regarding the perception of the vaccination. The survey included 280 patients with AIRD and 102 control subjects. 54% (152/280) of the patients and 67% (68/102) of the controls were willing to get vaccinated (p = 0.03). Patients > 45-years of age were more willing to vaccinate than those with age </= 45-years (61.9% vs. 44.8%; p = 0.001). Patients with lower education had more vaccine hesitancy than those with graduation and above (38% vs. 69%; p < 0.001). The common reason for vaccine hesitancy was not-yet-decided, fear related to vaccine side-effects, and disease worsening. 29% (82/280) patients were already vaccinated, out of which 35% (35/82) had mild events (fever/myalgia/headache). AIRD patients had fewer side effects than controls, and disease flare was seen in only one patient. Thus, educating AIRD patients regarding the pros and cons of vaccination, particularly concerning immunological disease, can help us overcome vaccine hesitancy. The message should clearly penetrate that there is a negligible risk of AIRD-flares with the COVID-19 immunization and the side effects are mild and manageable.	Treatment
34367760	Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 Pneumonia. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is the collection of air within the mediastinal cavity, which is commonly described in the literature for mechanical ventilation and perforation of hollow viscera. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rare but salient etiology of this complication in the current pandemic. Here, we are narrating a case of a 46-year-old male, in whom COVID-19 pneumonia was complicated by SPM. The complication was identified on chest computed tomography (CT) and was managed conservatively, leading to a favorable outcome. SPM has undemanding management, but timely identification and appropriate treatment institution are crucial in this milieu. A literature search revealed similar cases of SPM in COVID-19 with different outcomes and the important ones are included in this report.	Case Report
34287572	Social control and nursing performance in defense of life in the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: to reflect on social control in health and the contributions that nursing can make to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: this is a theoretical reflection, elaborated from discussions based on literature and the experience of authors' performance in social control and in Primary Care. It is divided into two topics: the first, related to aspects of institutionalized social control; the second, related to the perspectives for nursing in this space. RESULTS: limits and relevant aspects for nurses' role in social control are presented, contributing to a perspective of praxis in health based on their ethical-political commitment and their technical competence in the coordination and management of care to face the pandemic. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: nurses' role in social control favors the strengthening of the struggle for the right to life above profits, especially through popular participation in the community context in Primary Care.

34287031	Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by Simulated Sunlight on Contaminated Surfaces. We studied the stability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) under different simulated outdoor conditions by changing the temperature (20 degrees C and 35 degrees C), the illuminance (darkness, 10 klx, and 56 klx), and/or the cleanness of the surfaces at 50% relative humidity (RH). In darkness, the loss of viability of the virus on stainless steel is temperature dependent, but this is hidden by the effect of the sunlight from the first minutes of exposure. The virus shows a sensitivity to sunlight proportional to the illuminance intensity of the sunlight. The presence of interfering substances has a moderate effect on virus viability even with an elevated illuminance. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly inactivated by simulated sunlight in the presence or absence of high levels of interfering substances at 20 degrees C or 35 degrees C and 50% relative humidity. IMPORTANCE Clinical matrix contains high levels of interfering substances. This study is the first to reveal that the presence of high levels of interfering substances had little impact on the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on stainless steel following exposure to simulated sunlight. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 should be rapidly inactivated in outdoor environments in the presence or absence of interfering substances. Our results indicate that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to occur through outdoor surfaces, dependent on illuminance intensity. Moreover, most studies are interested in lineage S of SARS-CoV-2. In our experiments, we studied the stability of L-type strains, which comprise the majority of strains isolated from worldwide patients. Nevertheless, the effect of sunlight seems to be similar regardless of the strain studied, suggesting that the greater spread of certain variants is not correlated with better survival in outdoor conditions.

34224449	COVID-19 and Cardiometabolic Disease. Cardiometabolic disease describes a combination of metabolic abnormalities that increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including pathological changes such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, and hypertension (HTN), and environmental risk factors such as smoking, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and poverty. As the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients continues to rise, T2DM, CVD, HTN, and obesity, all components of, or sequelae of cardiometabolic disease, were identified among others as key risk factors associated with increased mortality in these patients. Numerous studies have been done to further elucidate this relationship between COVID-19 and cardiometabolic disease. Cardiometabolic disease is associated with both increased susceptibility to COVID-19 and worse outcomes of COVID-19, including intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and death. The proinflammatory state of cardiometabolic disease specifically obesity, has been associated with a worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. There has been no evidence to suggest that antihypertensives and antidiabetic medications should be discontinued in COVID-19 patients but these patients should be closely monitored to ensure that their blood pressure and blood glucose levels are stable. Assessment of vaccination efficacy in cardiometabolic disease patients is also discussed.	Treatment
34224635	The COVID-19 pandemic and reproductive genetic counseling: Changes in access and service delivery at an academic medical center in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic widely disrupted the delivery of healthcare services, including genetic counseling. To ensure continuity of care, the reproductive genetic counselors at a large academic medical center in the United States rapidly transitioned their practice from 90% in-person patient consultations to a predominantly telehealth model. The present study describes this transition in regard to patient access to genetic counseling and genetic screening. A chart review of patients seen by the reproductive genetic counselors from January 2020 to August 2020 was completed. The time frame included the three months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the first five months during COVID-19. Patient demographics and clinical and appointment data were compared between the pre-COVID-19 and during-COVID-19 timeframes. Overall, 88.6% of patients were seen via telehealth during COVID-19 and there was no significant difference based upon patient age (p = .20), indication for appointment (p = .06), or gestational age (p = .06). However, non-English speaking patients were more often seen in-person than by telehealth (p < .001), and more patients residing farther from the clinic were seen via telehealth (p = .004). During-COVID-19 results for prenatal cell-free DNA screening and expanded carrier screening were delayed (p < .001). Additionally, after consenting to screening, patients seen during COVID-19 were more likely to not complete a sample collection for their intended screening when compared to those seen pre-COVID-19 (OR = 6.15, 95% CI = 1.43-26.70, p = .015). Overall, this study supports that access to genetic counseling services and genetic screening can be maintained during a global pandemic like COVID-19. Genetic counselors are well-equipped to pivot swiftly during challenging times; however, they must continue to work to address other barriers to accessing genetic services, especially for non-English speaking populations. Future studies are needed to pose solutions to the obstacles confronted in this service delivery model during a global pandemic.	Prevention
34204735	Hyperactivated RAGE in Comorbidities as a Risk Factor for Severe COVID-19-The Role of RAGE-RAS Crosstalk. The receptor for advanced glycation-end products (RAGE) is a multiligand receptor with a role in inflammatory and pulmonary pathologies. Hyperactivation of RAGE by its ligands has been reported to sustain inflammation and oxidative stress in common comorbidities of severe COVID-19. RAGE is essential to the deleterious effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which participates in infection and multiorgan injury in COVID-19 patients. Thus, RAGE might be a major player in severe COVID-19, and appears to be a useful therapeutic molecular target in infections by SARS-CoV-2. The role of RAGE gene polymorphisms in predisposing patients to severe COVID-19 is discussed.&nbsp.	Mechanism;Treatment

34287589	[Profiles of epidemiological-nutritional transition and burden of morbimortality from COVID-19 in Argentina: an ecological study]. The study aimed to identify epidemiological-nutritional profiles in Argentina and to compare the burden of morbimortality from COVID-19. A multigroup ecological study was conducted with 24 geographic units in Argentina. We estimated the percent change from 2005 to 2018 in indicators of the epidemiological-nutritional transition and sociodemographic indicators according to geographic unit. We performed principal components analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis to identify geographic groupings to define profiles in the epidemiological-nutritional transition. By group, we calculated summary measures of COVID-19 cumulative incidence (CI), mortality, and case fatality (epidemiological week 50), establishing comparisons via Student's t test. Three profiles were identified: (1) reemergence of infectious diseases, (2) persistence of cardiovascular diseases despite social, health, and lifestyle improvements, and (3) consolidation of the triad obesity-sedentarism-cardiometabolic diseases. Mean COVID-19 cumulative incidence and mortality were higher in provinces with profile 1 compared to profile 2 (CI: p = 0.0159; mortality: p = 0.0187) and profile 3 (CI: p = 0.0205). Case-fatality was higher in profile 3, which includes provinces with more unfavorable socioeconomic conditions, showing significant differences from profile 2 (p=0.0307). In conclusion, there are distinct epidemiological-nutritional profiles in Argentina which tend to differ in terms of their COVID-19 epidemiological situation. Strategies to fight COVID-19 should consider the underlying epidemiological, nutritional, and sociodemographic characteristics.	Prevention
34375133	"Repurposing Psychotropic Agents for Viral Disorders: Beyond Covid. Recent reports have highlighted the possible role of the antipsychotic chlorpromazine and the antidepressant fluvoxamine as anti-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) agents. The objective of this narrative review is to explore what is known about the activity of psychotropic medications against viruses in addition to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). PubMed was queried for ""drug repurposing, antiviral activity,"" and for ""antiviral activity"" with ""psychotropic drugs"" and individual agents, through November 2020. Of more than 100 psychotropic agents, 37 drugs, including 27 with a history of pediatric use were identified, which had been studied in the preclinical setting and found to have activity against viruses which are human pathogens. Effects were evaluated by type of virus and by category of psychotropic agent. Activity was identified both against viruses known to cause epidemics such as SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola and against those that are the cause of rare disorders such as Human Papillomatosis Virus-related respiratory papillomatosis. Individual drugs and classes of psychotropics often had activity against multiple viruses, with promiscuity explained by shared viral or cellular targets. Safety profiles of psychotropics may be more tolerable in this context than when they are used long-term in the setting of psychiatric illness. Nonetheless, translation of in vitro results to the clinical arena has been slow. Psychotropic medications as a class deserve further study, including in clinical trials for repurposing as antiviral drugs for children and adults."	Treatment
34346604	[Multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19: Not just a pediatric disease]. BACKGROUND: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a hyperinflammatory syndrome has appeared which develops weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. This multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described mainly in children (MIS-C), but lately has also been found in adults (MIS-A). CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a woman with MIS-A. She had fever, diarrhoea, hypotension, laboratory abnormalities with high inflammatory markers, coagulation parameters, troponin-T, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Her electrocardiogram had marked diffuse ST-depressions. She was diagnosed in an early stage of MIS-A and treated successfully with immune suppression, antiaggregants and anticoagulants. CONCLUSION: MIS-A and MIS-C are similar, potentially life-threatening inflammatory syndromes which can lead to severe cardiac dysfunction and cardiovascular failure. For effective treatment and prevention of complications, timely recognition is essential. Clinicians should therefore be mindful of this multisystem inflammatory syndrome, not just in children but also in adults.	Case Report
34132579	Evaluation of Self-Collected Mid-Turbinate Nasal Swabs and Saliva for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Rapid and accurate diagnostic testing is essential to bring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to an end. As the demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing continues to increase amid supply shortages, many laboratories have investigated the use of sources other than nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. Saliva and mid-turbinate nasal swabs are attractive alternatives as they allow for self-collection and are well-accepted by patients. Saliva also requires limited consumables. We compared the performance of health care provider-collected NP swabs, patient-collected mid-turbinate (MT) swabs, and patient-collected saliva specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection using a laboratory developed PCR assay that had received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. Of 281 total evaluable samples, 33 (11.7%) NP swabs, 33 (11.7%) MT swabs, and 32 (11.4%) saliva specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 following resolution of discordant results. When compared to NP swabs, saliva exhibited a sensitivity of 90.9% (30/33) and specificity of 99.2% (246/248), while patient-collected MT swabs exhibited a sensitivity of 93.9% (31/33) and specificity of 99.2% (246/248). When comparing to the consensus standard, the sensitivity was 100% (31/31) for both NP and MT swabs and 96.8% (30/31) for saliva specimens, while specificity was the same in both NP swabs and saliva specimens (98.8% [247/250]) and 99.2% (248/250) for MT swabs. Pre-treatment of saliva with proteinase K and heating for 15 minutes prior to extraction reduced the invalid rate from 26.7% (52/195) to 0% (0/195). These data show that patient-collected mid-turbinate nasal swabs and saliva are suitable sources for self-collection in individuals who require routine monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Diagnosis
34198973	SARS-CoV-2 Portrayed against HIV: Contrary Viral Strategies in Similar Disguise. SARS-CoV-2 and HIV are zoonotic viruses that rapidly reached pandemic scale, causing global losses and fear. The COVID-19 and AIDS pandemics ignited massive efforts worldwide to develop antiviral strategies and characterize viral architectures, biological and immunological properties, and clinical outcomes. Although both viruses have a comparable appearance as enveloped viruses with positive-stranded RNA and envelope spikes mediating cellular entry, the entry process, downstream biological and immunological pathways, clinical outcomes, and disease courses are strikingly different. This review provides a systemic comparison of both viruses' structural and functional characteristics, delineating their distinct strategies for efficient spread.	Mechanism
34347570	Novel malaria vaccines. Malaria vaccines hold significant promise for life-saving benefit, especially to children who bear the major burden of malaria mortality. The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine provides moderate efficacy and is being tested in implementation studies. In parallel, multiple strategies are being advanced to test next-generation malaria vaccines, including novel approaches that build on principles learned from RTS,S development, vaccination with radiation-attenuated sporozoites, and development of monoclonal antibodies targeting immunogenic peptides. Novel vaccine delivery approaches are also being advanced, including self-amplifying RNA vaccine delivery, self-assembling protein nanoparticle methods, circumsporozoite protein-based approaches, and whole organism vaccination. Techniques employed for COVID-19 vaccine development should also be considered for malaria vaccination, including sustained release polymer nanoparticle hydrogel vaccination and charge-altering releasable transporters. As vaccine science advances and new approaches optimize knowledge gained, highly effective malaria vaccines that provide sustained protection are within reach.	Treatment
34199070	COVID-19 Mortality Rate and Its Incidence in Latin America: Dependence on Demographic and Economic Variables. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has left millions infected and dead around the world, with Latin America being one of the most affected areas. In this work, we have sought to determine, by means of a multiple regression analysis and a study of correlations, the influence of population density, life expectancy, and proportion of the population in vulnerable employment, together with GDP per capita, on the mortality rate due to COVID-19 in Latin American countries. The results indicated that countries with higher population density had lower numbers of deaths. Population in vulnerable employment and GDP showed a positive influence, while life expectancy did not appear to significantly affect the number of COVID-19 deaths. In addition, the influence of these variables on the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was analyzed. It can be concluded that the lack of resources can be a major burden for the vulnerable population in combating COVID-19 and that population density can ensure better designed institutions and quality infrastructure to achieve social distancing and, together with effective measures, lower death rates.

34284639	National Early Warning Score 2 and laboratory predictors correlate with clinical deterioration in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Aim: We aimed to determine the prognostic values of the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) and laboratory parameters during the first week of COVID-19. Materials & methods: All adult patients who were hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19 between 11 March and 11 May 2020 were retrospectively included. Results: Overall, 611 patients were included. Our results showed that NEWS2, procalcitonin, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and albumin at D0, D3, D5 and D7 were the best predictors for clinical deterioration defined as a composite of ICU admission during hospitalization or in-hospital death. Procalcitonin had the highest odds ratio for clinical deterioration on all days. Conclusion: This study provides a list of several laboratory parameters correlated with NEWS2 and potential predictors for clinical deterioration in patients with COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34379700	COVID-19 and cause of pregnancy loss during the pandemic: A systematic review. INTRODUCTION: The association between Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and abortion has been debated since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to conduct this systematic review to understand better the potential effects of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on fetal loss in infected mothers presented with abortion following this infection. METHODS: We included articles published in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, and Embase databases in 2019 and 2020 through a comprehensive search via appropriate keywords, including COVID-19 and abortion synonyms. All studies with the abortion data in COVID-19 confirmed pregnant females were collected. RESULTS: Out of 208 potentially relevant articles, 11 articles were eligible to include in the systematic review. The included reports were published because of the following reasons: (1) First-trimester miscarriage; (2) Late miscarriage; (3) complication of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy; (4) COVID-19 disease in artificial pregnancy. First-trimester abortion was found in 5 studies, and second-trimester abortion in 7 studies. Two patients acquired infection during the hospital stay while they were referred for abortion. Reports related to abortion in pregnant females with COVID-19 show that most miscarriages due to COVID-19 in the first trimester were due to placental insufficiency. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of abortion in mothers with a positive test result of SARS-CoV-2, which several case reports and case series have identified during the pandemic. Placental inflammation during the viral infection may result in fetal growth retardation and induce abortion. There has not been any consistent evidence of vertical transmission of the virus from mother to fetus, which requires further investigation.	Transmission
34332652	Risk of acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke following COVID-19 in Sweden: a self-controlled case series and matched cohort study. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a complex disease targeting many organs. Previous studies highlight COVID-19 as a probable risk factor for acute cardiovascular complications. We aimed to quantify the risk of acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke associated with COVID-19 by analysing all COVID-19 cases in Sweden. METHODS: This self-controlled case series (SCCS) and matched cohort study was done in Sweden. The personal identification numbers of all patients with COVID-19 in Sweden from Feb 1 to Sept 14, 2020, were identified and cross-linked with national inpatient, outpatient, cancer, and cause of death registers. The controls were matched on age, sex, and county of residence in Sweden. International Classification of Diseases codes for acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke were identified in causes of hospital admission for all patients with COVID-19 in the SCCS and all patients with COVID-19 and the matched control individuals in the matched cohort study. The SCCS method was used to calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for first acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke following COVID-19 compared with a control period. The matched cohort study was used to determine the increased risk that COVID-19 confers compared with the background population of increased acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke in the first 2 weeks following COVID-19. FINDINGS: 86 742 patients with COVID-19 were included in the SCCS study, and 348 481 matched control individuals were also included in the matched cohort study. When day of exposure was excluded from the risk period in the SCCS, the IRR for acute myocardial infarction was 2.89 (95% CI 1.51-5.55) for the first week, 2.53 (1.29-4.94) for the second week, and 1.60 (0.84-3.04) in weeks 3 and 4 following COVID-19. When day of exposure was included in the risk period, IRR was 8.44 (5.45-13.08) for the first week, 2.56 (1.31-5.01) for the second week, and 1.62 (0.85-3.09) for weeks 3 and 4 following COVID-19. The corresponding IRRs for ischaemic stroke when day of exposure was excluded from the risk period were 2.97 (1.71-5.15) in the first week, 2.80 (1.60-4.88) in the second week, and 2.10 (1.33-3.32) in weeks 3 and 4 following COVID-19; when day of exposure was included in the risk period, the IRRs were 6.18 (4.06-9.42) for the first week, 2.85 (1.64-4.97) for the second week, and 2.14 (1.36-3.38) for weeks 3 and 4 following COVID-19. In the matched cohort analysis excluding day 0, the odds ratio (OR) for acute myocardial infarction was 3.41 (1.58-7.36) and for stroke was 3.63 (1.69-7.80) in the 2 weeks following COVID-19. When day 0 was included in the matched cohort study, the OR for acute myocardial infarction was 6.61 (3.56-12.20) and for ischaemic stroke was 6.74 (3.71-12.20) in the 2 weeks following COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 is a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke. This indicates that acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke represent a part of the clinical picture of COVID-19, and highlights the need for vaccination against COVID-19.

34226884	Physician Satisfaction With Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mayo Clinic Florida Experience. Objective: To evaluate physician perceptions and attitudes toward telemedicine use at a tertiary care academic institution in northeast Florida during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Patients and Methods: An anonymous 38-question cross-sectional survey was developed using Qualtrics survey software (Qualtrics) and e-mailed to all staff physicians from all specialty disciplines at Mayo Clinic in Florida. The survey was open from August 17, 2020, through September 1, 2020. Collected data included general demographic characteristics and employment information, attitude and experience with telemedicine use before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, perception of patients' experience, and the effect of telemedicine on burnout. Results: The survey was distributed to 529 eligible physicians at our institution, with 103 physicians responding (20%). The distribution of specialties was 22% primary care specialties, 41% other internal medicine subspecialties, and 18% surgical specialties. Collectively, 63% found comparable quality of care when provided virtually (vs in-person) whereas 80% perceived telemedicine as cost-effective. A total of 76% of physicians felt that telemedicine increased flexibility and control over patient care activities, with 36% reporting improved work-life balance and 30% reporting improved burnout symptoms. Overall, 42% preferred using telemedicine over in-person visits when possible. Conclusion: Physicians generally had positive attitudes regarding the adoption of telemedicine and perceived that the quality of health care delivery as generally comparable to in-person care. Future studies are needed to explore attitudes regarding telemedicine after the pandemic and how this virtual technology may be further used to improve physicians' professional and personal well-being.

34284218	Knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among Indonesian migrant workers in the Greater China Region. OBJECTIVES: Migrant workers are one of the most vulnerable population groups during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study investigated knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among Indonesian migrant workers (IMWs) in Macao (SAR), Hong Kong (SAR), and Taiwan. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey in February and March 2020 to gain information on (1) participants' sociodemographic characteristics, (2) experience and awareness regarding COVID-19 information, and (3) knowledge and understanding of COVID-19. A series of Chi-squared, t-test, and logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 491 participants (92.1% female). Knowledge of COVID-19 was obtained from multiple sources, including a large proportion from online social media. However, participants who obtained information from their employer, local social networks, and migrant organisations answered a greater number of questions correctly. One-third of participants reported receiving hoax, fake news, and incorrect information and obtained information from unverified sources. Participants were most interested in information about how to cure COVID-19, and 57.8% knew that no specific drug or vaccine was currently available. Almost all participants correctly identified fever and wearing a facemask as the main COVID-19 symptom and prevention strategy, respectively. Participants with senior high school or higher education and who worked as domestic or care workers had a greater knowledge of COVID-19 than their counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Public health communication strategies using multiple channels, including employers and community organisations, would help to minimise COVID-19 knowledge gaps. In addition, it is recommended that digital literacy content is added to public health campaigns.	Prevention
34356924	Risk Factors for Fungal Co-Infections in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients, with a Focus on Immunosuppressants. Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) managed in the intensive care unit are prone to complications, including secondary infections with opportunistic fungal pathogens. Systemic fungal co-infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients may exacerbate COVID-19 disease severity, hamper treatment effectiveness and increase mortality. Here, we reiterate the role of fungal co-infections in exacerbating COVID-19 disease severity as well as highlight emerging trends related to fungal disease burden in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we provide perspectives on the risk factors for fungal co-infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and highlight the potential role of prolonged immunomodulatory treatments in driving fungal co-infections, including COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), COVID-19-associated candidiasis (CAC) and mucormycosis. We reiterate the need for early diagnosis of suspected COVID-19-associated systemic mycoses in the hospital setting.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34351990	Questioning the sex-specific differences in the association of smoking on the survival rate of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. INTRODUCTION: In the absence of a universally accepted association between smoking and COVID-19 health outcomes, we investigated this relationship in a representative cohort from one of the world's highest tobacco consuming regions. This is the first report from the Middle East and North Africa that tackles specifically the association of smoking and COVID-19 mortality while demonstrating a novel sex-discrepancy in the survival rates among patients. METHODS: Clinical data for 743 hospitalized COVID-19 patients was retrospectively collected from the leading centre for COVID-19 testing and treatment in Lebanon. Logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age and stratified by sex were used to assess the association between the current cigarette smoking status of patients and COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: In addition to the high smoking prevalence among our hospitalized COVID-19 patients (42.3%), enrolled smokers tended to have higher reported ICU admissions (28.3% vs 16.6%, p<0.001), longer length of stay in the hospital (12.0 +/- 7.8 vs 10.8 days, p<0.001) and higher death incidences as compared to non-smokers (60.5% vs 39.5%, p<0.001). Smokers had an elevated odds ratio for death (OR = 2.3, p<0.001) and for ICU admission (OR = 2.0, p<0.001) which remained significant in a multivariate regression model. Once adjusted for age and stratified by sex, our data revealed that current smoking status reduces survival rate in male patients ([HR] = 1.9 [95% (CI), 1.029-3.616]; p = 0.041) but it does not affect survival outcomes among hospitalized female patients([HR] = 0.79 [95% CI = 0.374-1.689]; p = 0.551). CONCLUSION: A high smoking prevalence was detected in our hospitalized COVID-19 cohort combined with worse prognosis and higher mortality rate in smoking patients. Our study was the first to highlight potential sex-specific consequences for smoking on COVID-19 outcomes that might further explain the higher vulnerability to death from this disease among men.

34286215	Safety and immunogenicity evaluation of inactivated whole-virus-SARS-COV-2 as emerging vaccine development in Egypt. Background: Current worldwide pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with high numbers of mortality rates and huge economic problems require an urgent demand for safe and effective vaccine development. Inactivated SARS-CoV2 vaccine with alum. Hydroxide can play an important role in reducing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, vaccine efficacy was evaluated through the detection of the neutralizing antibodies that protect mice from challenge with SARS-CoV 2 3 weeks after the second dose. We conclude that the vaccine described here has safety and desirable properties, and our data support further development and plans for clinical trials. Methods: Characterized SARS-COV-2 strain, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolates (SARS-CoV-2/human/EGY/Egy-SERVAC/2020) with accession numbers; MT981440; MT981439; MT981441; MT974071; MT974069; and MW250352 at GenBank were isolated from Egyptian patients SARS-CoV-2-positive. Development of inactivated vaccine was carried out in a BSL-3 facilities and the immunogenicity was determined in mice at two doses (55 and 100 mug per dose). Results: The distinct cytopathic effect induced by SARS-COV-2 propagation on Vero cell monolayers and the viral particles were identified as Coronaviridae by transmission electron microscopy and RT-PCR on infected cells cultures. Immunogenicity of the developed vaccine indicated the high antigen-binding and neutralizing antibody titers, regardless of the dose concentration, with excellent safety profiles and no deaths or clinical symptoms in mice groups. The efficacy of the inactivated vaccine formulation was tested by the wild virus challenge of the vaccinated mice and viral replication detection in lung tissues. Conclusions: Vaccinated mice recorded complete protection from challenge infection via inhibition of SARS-COV-2 replication in the lung tissues of mice following virus challenge, regardless of the level of serum neutralizing antibodies. This finding will support future trials for the evaluation of an applicable SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.	Treatment
34226870	Outcome of Hospitalized Parkinson's Disease Patients with and without COVID-19. Background: The Parkinson's disease (PD) patient population, with an already reduced life expectancy, is rendered particularly vulnerable by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objectives: We determined the risk factors that increase the risk of death in patients with Parkinson's disease who are infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of PD admitted to Montefiore Hospital (Bronx, New York) and tested for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. Retrospective review of electronic medical records confirmed the diagnosis; patients were classified by severity of PD. PD severity, demographic, socioeconomic factors, and co-morbidities were correlated with mortality rates in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Results: We identified 162 patients meeting criteria; chart review confirmed a diagnosis of PD in 70 patients. Of the 70 patients, 53 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 17 were negative. PD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had a higher mortality rate (35.8%) compared to PD patients without the infection (5.9%, P = 0.028). PD patients older than 70 years of age, those with advanced Parkinson's disease, those with reductions in their medications, and non-Hispanics (largely comprised of Black/African- Americans) had a statistically significant higher mortality rate, if infected. Conclusions: PD did not increase mortality rates from SARS-CoV-2 infection when age was controlled. However, certain unalterable factors (advanced disease and age greater than 70 years) and alterable ones (reductions in PD medications) placed PD patients at increased risk for mortality. Also several socioeconomic factors contributed to mortality, for example, non-Hispanic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection fared worse, likely driven by poorer outcomes in the Black/African-American cohort.

34205807	Clinical Performance of Paraoxonase-1-Related Variables and Novel Markers of Inflammation in Coronavirus Disease-19. A Machine Learning Approach. SARS-CoV-2 infection produces a response of the innate immune system causing oxidative stress and a strong inflammatory reaction termed 'cytokine storm' that is one of the leading causes of death. Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) protects against oxidative stress by hydrolyzing lipoperoxides. Alterations in PON1 activity have been associated with pro-inflammatory mediators such as the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), and the glycoprotein galectin-3. We aimed to investigate the alterations in the circulating levels of PON1, CCL2, and galectin-3 in 126 patients with COVID-19 and their interactions with clinical variables and analytical parameters. A machine learning approach was used to identify predictive markers of the disease. For comparisons, we recruited 45 COVID-19 negative patients and 50 healthy individuals. Our approach identified a synergy between oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrogenesis in positive patients that is not observed in negative patients. PON1 activity was the parameter with the greatest power to discriminate between patients who were either positive or negative for COVID-19, while their levels of CCL2 and galectin-3 were similar. We suggest that the measurement of serum PON1 activity may be a useful marker for the diagnosis of COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
34210893	SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion by the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant of concern. A novel variant of concern (VOC) named CAL.20C (B.1.427/B.1.429), which was originally detected in California, carries spike glycoprotein mutations S13I in the signal peptide, W152C in the N-terminal domain (NTD), and L452R in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Plasma from individuals vaccinated with a Wuhan-1 isolate-based messenger RNA vaccine or from convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers that were reduced 2- to 3.5-fold against the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative to wild-type pseudoviruses. The L452R mutation reduced neutralizing activity in 14 of 34 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The S13I and W152C mutations resulted in total loss of neutralization for 10 of 10 NTD-specific mAbs because the NTD antigenic supersite was remodeled by a shift of the signal peptide cleavage site and the formation of a new disulfide bond, as revealed by mass spectrometry and structural studies.

34225789	Hormonal intervention for the treatment of veterans with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization (HITCH): a multicenter, phase 2 randomized controlled trial of best supportive care vs best supportive care plus degarelix: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Therapeutic targeting of host-cell factors required for SARS-CoV-2 entry is an alternative strategy to ameliorate COVID-19 severity. SARS-CoV-2 entry into lung epithelium requires the TMPRSS2 cell surface protease. Pre-clinical and correlative data in humans suggest that anti-androgenic therapies can reduce the expression of TMPRSS2 on lung epithelium. Accordingly, we hypothesize that therapeutic targeting of androgen receptor signaling via degarelix, a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonist, will suppress COVID-19 infection and ameliorate symptom severity. METHODS: This is a randomized phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in 198 patients to compare efficacy of degarelix plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care on improving the clinical outcomes of male Veterans who have been hospitalized due to COVID-19. Enrolled patients must have documented infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction result performed on a nasopharyngeal swab and have a severity of illness of level 3-5 (hospitalized but not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation). Patients stratified by age, history of hypertension, and severity are centrally randomized 2:1 (degarelix: placebo). The composite primary endpoint is mortality, ongoing need for hospitalization, or requirement for mechanical ventilation at 15 after randomization. Important secondary endpoints include time to clinical improvement, inpatient mortality, length of hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation, time to achieve a normal temperature, and the maximum severity of COVID-19 illness. Exploratory analyses aim to assess the association of cytokines, viral load, and various comorbidities with outcome. In addition, TMPRSS2 expression in target tissue and development of anti-viral antibodies will also be investigated. DISCUSSION: In this trial, we repurpose the FDA approved LHRH antagonist degarelix, commonly used for prostate cancer, to suppress TMPRSS2, a host cell surface protease required for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. The objective is to determine if temporary androgen suppression with a single dose of degarelix improves the clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19.

34290785	Exploring Reproductive Health Impact of COVID 19 pandemic: In Depth Interviews with key stakeholders in Pakistan. Objective: To explore the effects of COVID 19 on reproductive and child health services and gender relations. Methods: This is a Qualitative Exploratory Research. Due to lockdown, setting was online interviews on Zoom. Sampling was purposive. Five in-depth interviews were conducted in June 2020 followed by compilation of results and manuscript writing in July and August 2020. Results: Maternal Neonatal morbidity and mortality will rise as part of collateral damage of C19. As all routine services of maternity care, family planning, post abortion care and vaccination were also in lockdown. Baby boom, unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions and violence against women will be the secondary consequences of C19. Conclusion: Some critical services should never stop which include maternal and neonatal essential services. MNCH service continuity has to be maintained to optimize maternal neonatal health, prevent unwanted pregnancy and abortion. With appropriate standard operating procedures, and protective equipments, health facilities need to open. LHWs and community mobilisers with PPEs should continue services.	Prevention

34291736	L-SIGN is a receptor on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells for SARS-CoV-2 virus. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a pandemic. Severe disease is associated with dysfunction of multiple organs, but some infected cells do not express ACE2, the canonical entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report that the C-type lectin receptor L-SIGN interacted in a Ca2+-dependent manner with high-mannose-type N-glycans on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that L-SIGN was highly expressed on human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and lymph node lymphatic endothelial cells but not on blood endothelial cells. Using high-resolution confocal microscopy imaging, we detected SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins within the LSECs from liver autopsy samples from patients with COVID-19. We found that both pseudo-typed virus enveloped with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus infected L-SIGN-expressing cells relative to control cells. Moreover, blocking L-SIGN function reduced CoV-2-type infection. These results indicate that L-SIGN is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. LSECs are major sources of the clotting factors vWF and factor VIII (FVIII). LSECs from liver autopsy samples from patients with COVID-19 expressed substantially higher levels of vWF and FVIII than LSECs from uninfected liver samples. Our data demonstrate that L-SIGN is an endothelial cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 that may contribute to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy.	Mechanism
34288294	Transplantation programs facing lack of empirical evidence on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: A society recommendation consensus update. BACKGROUND: Since phase III trials for the most prominent vaccines excluded immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients, data on safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for recipients of solid organ transplantations are scarce. AIMS: Our study offers a synthesis of expert opinions aligned with available data addressing key questions of the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations for transplant patients. METHOD: An online research was performed retrieving available recommendations by national and international transplantation organizations and state institutions on SARS-CoV2 vaccination management for transplant recipients. RESULTS: Eleven key statements were identified from recommendations by 18 national and international societies, and consensus for the individual statements was evaluated by means of the Society Recommendation Consensus score. The highest consensus level (SRC A) was found for prioritized access to vaccination for transplant patients despite anticipation of a weakened immune response. All currently authorized vaccines can be considered safe for transplant patients (SRC A). The handling of immunosuppressive medication, the timely management of vaccines, and other aspects were aligned with available expert opinions. CONCLUSION: Expert consensus can be determined for crucial aspects of the implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs. We hereby offer a tool for immediate decision-making until empirical data becomes available.	Treatment
34220846	A Comparative Analysis of Coronavirus Nucleocapsid (N) Proteins Reveals the SADS-CoV N Protein Antagonizes IFN-beta Production by Inducing Ubiquitination of RIG-I. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a known global threat, and most recently the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has claimed more than 2 million human lives. Delays and interference with IFN responses are closely associated with the severity of disease caused by CoV infection. As the most abundant viral protein in infected cells just after the entry step, the CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein likely plays a key role in IFN interruption. We have conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis and report herein that the N proteins of representative human and animal CoVs from four different genera [swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV)] suppress IFN responses by multiple strategies. In particular, we found that the N protein of SADS-CoV interacted with RIG-I independent of its RNA binding activity, mediating K27-, K48- and K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I and its subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation, thus inhibiting the host IFN response. These data provide insight into the interaction between CoVs and host, and offer new clues for the development of therapies against these important viruses.	Mechanism;Treatment
34291390	QTc interval prolongation, inflammation, and mortality in patients with COVID-19. PURPOSE: Systemic inflammation has been associated with corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation. The role of inflammation on QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients was investigated. METHODS: Patients with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute (Milan, Italy) between March 14, 2020, and March 30, 2020 were included. QTc-I was defined as the QTc interval by Bazett formula in the first ECG performed during the hospitalization, before any new drug treatment; QTc-II was the QTc in the ECG performed after the initiation of hydroxychloroquine drug treatment. RESULTS: QTc-I was long in 45 patients (45%) and normal in 55 patients (55%). Patients with long QTc-I were older and more frequently males. C-Reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) count at hospitalization were higher in patients with long QTc-I and long QTc-II. QTc-I was significantly correlated with CRP levels at hospitalization. After a median follow-up of 83 days, 14 patients (14%) died. There were no deaths attributed to ventricular arrhythmias. Patients with long QTc-I and long QTc-II had a shorter survival, compared with normal QTc-I and QTc-II patients, respectively. In Cox multivariate analysis, independent predictors of mortality were age (HR = 1.1, CI 95% 1.04-1.18, p = 0.002) and CRP at ECG II (HR 1.1, CI 95% 1.0-1.1, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: QTc at hospitalization is a simple risk marker of mortality risk in COVID-19 patients and reflects the myocardial inflammatory status.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34352133	COVID-19 and the Liver: Lessons Learnt from the EAST and the WEST, A Year Later. Globally, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) has been a major cause for significant morbidity and mortality. Since the start of the pandemic, several hepato-biliary manifestations in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been described and unique considerations raised. The review aims to summarize the pathogenesis and hepato-biliary manifestations in COVID-19 and discuss the similarities, contrasting features and disease-specific management across a range of hepato-biliary diseases from the EAST and the WEST. Published studies and regional society guidelines from the EAST and the WEST were comprehensively reviewed and summarized. A wide range of hepato-biliary manifestations, including the infrequent and chronic manifestation of cholangiopathy, has been observed in COVID-19. The pathogenesis of liver injury is multifactorial and with scant evidence for a direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of the liver. Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer are potentially at increased risk for severe COVID-19, and there are unique considerations in chronic hepatitis B or C, hepatocellular carcinoma, and in those immunosuppressed such as autoimmune hepatitis or liver transplant recipients. With the surges in SARS-CoV-2 infection, liver transplant activity has variably been impacted. Preliminarily, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines appear to be safe in those with chronic liver disease and in transplant recipients, while emerging data suggest the need for a third dose in immunosuppressed patients. In conclusion, patients with chronic liver disease, particularly cirrhosis, and liver transplant recipients, are vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Over the past year, several unique considerations have been highlighted across a spectrum of hepato-biliary diseases. Vaccination is strongly recommended for those with chronic liver disease and liver transplant recipients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34287742	Chemotherapy resumption in breast cancer patient after COVID-19. BACKGROUND: While many studies have verified the effect of recent anti-cancer treatment in patients with COVID-19, there are no data on the optimal time for cancer treatment resumption, as well as the safety of chemotherapy in COVID-19 patients. As many cancer patients are recovering from COVID-19, there is an urgent need for reliable clinical information. Herein, we report a case of invasive ductal carcinoma in which we were able to successfully resume chemotherapy after infection with SAR-CoV-2. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 38-year-old non-smoking Japanese woman with no significant medical history. She had fever on days 5 and 6 of her second course of adjuvant FEC therapy, and on day 7, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. She was hospitalized for 11 days. We resumed the therapy on day 25 after discharge, as she had no remaining clinical symptoms. The patient completed four courses of the initial chemotherapy without any major adverse events nor the recurrence of COVID-19, and subsequently completed four courses of docetaxel as her second regimen therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluating the risk for each patient is essential when resuming anti-cancer therapy in cancer patient's post-COVID-19.	Case Report
34286504	Association between serum amyloid A levels and predicting disase severity in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: Global health resources have faced huge challenges from the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since December 2019. Numerous clinical reports have focused on the association of serum amyloid A (SAA) levels with severe COVID-19. However, a systematic analysis synthesizing these findings has not been performed. This meta-analysis aims to systematically review the role of SAA levels in distinguishing among patients with mild, severe, and critical COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak to February 1, 2021. Two investigators independently reviewed suitable studies. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and correlation coefficients (r) were computed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: We included 19 of 317 titles identified by our search, involving a total of 1806 mild cases and 1529 severe cases. Compared with the mild group, the severe group had markedly higher SAA levels (SMD=1.155, 95% CI 0.89, 1.42). Subgroup analysis revealed that the SAA level differences between the severe group and the mild group were associated with age, sample size, and detection method. Sensitivity analyses showed the credibility and robustness of our results. In addition, in six studies involving 1144 patients with severe COVID-19 and 433 patients with critical COVID-19, SAA was significantly higher in patients with critical COVID-19 (SMD=0.476, 95% CI 0.13, 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: High circulating SAA levels were markedly associated with COVID-19 severity, especially for subjects aged less than 50 years, compared with patients with mild COVID-19. SAA concentrations were also significantly higher in patients with critical COVID-19 compared with those with severe COVID-19. Further studies in large cohorts are needed to confirm whether the SAA is a useful tool in discriminating among patients with stable COVID-19, those with acute exacerbations, and subjects without disease.

34228126	Seroprevalence of and Risk Factors Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Health Care Workers During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy. Importance: Identifying health care settings and professionals at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial to defining appropriate strategies, resource allocation, and protocols to protect health care workers (HCWs) and patients. Moreover, such information is crucial to decrease the risk that HCWs and health care facilities become amplifiers for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community. Objective: To assess the association of different health care professional categories and operational units, including in-hospital wards, outpatient facilities, and territorial care departments, with seroprevalence and odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted using IgG serological tests collected from April 1 through May 26, 2020, in the Lombardy region in Italy. Voluntary serological screening was offered to all clinical and nonclinical staff providing any health care services or support to health care services in the region. Data were analyzed from June 2020 through April 2021. Exposures: Employment in the health care sector. Main Outcomes and Measures: Seroprevalence of positive IgG antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 was collected, and odds ratios of experiencing infection were calculated. Results: A total of 140782 professionals employed in the health sector were invited to participate in IgG serological screening, among whom 82961 individuals (59.0% response rate) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, with median (interquartile range [IQR]; range) age, 50 (40-56; 19-83) years and 59839 (72.1%) women. Among these individuals, 10115 HCWs (12.2%; 95% CI, 12.0%-12.4%) had positive results (median [IQR; range] age, 50 [39-55; 20-80] years; 7298 [72.2%] women). Statistically significantly higher odds of infection were found among health assistants (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33-1.65) and nurses (aOR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.17-1.41) compared with administrative staff and among workers employed in internal medicine (aOR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.87-2.68), palliative care (aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.38-2.44), rehabilitation (aOR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.33-1.91), and emergency departments (aOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.29-1.89) compared with those working as telephone operators. Statistically significantly lower odds of infection were found among individuals working in forensic medicine (aOR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19-0.88), histology and anatomical pathology (aOR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52-0.97), and medical device sterilization (aOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.84) compared with those working as telephone operators. The odds of infection for physicians and laboratory personnel were not statistically significantly different from those found among administrative staff. The odds of infection for workers employed in intensive care units and infectious disease wards were not statistically significantly different from those of telephone operators. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that professionals partially accustomed to managing infectious diseases had higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings further suggest that adequate organization of clinical wards and personnel, appropriate personal protective equipment supply, and training of all workers directly and repeatedly exposed to patients with clinical or subclinical COVID-19 should be prioritized to decrease the risk of infection in health care settings.

34368756	AI-Empowered Computational Examination of Chest Imaging for COVID-19 Treatment: A Review. Since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered in December 2019, COVID-19 swiftly spread over the world. By the end of March 2021, more than 136 million patients have been infected. Since the second and third waves of the COVID-19 outbreak are in full swing, investigating effective and timely solutions for patients' check-ups and treatment is important. Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test is recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the test results are prone to be false negative in the early course of COVID-19 infection. To enhance the screening efficiency and accessibility, chest images captured via X-ray or computed tomography (CT) provide valuable information when evaluating patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. With advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, AI-driven models training with lung scans emerge as quick diagnostic and screening tools for detecting COVID-19 infection in patients. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art AI-empowered methods for computational examination of COVID-19 patients with lung scans. In this regard, we searched for papers and preprints on bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv published for the period from January 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, using the keywords of COVID, lung scans, and AI. After the quality screening, 96 studies are included in this review. The reviewed studies were grouped into three categories based on their target application scenarios: automatic detection of coronavirus disease, infection segmentation, and severity assessment and prognosis prediction. The latest AI solutions to process and analyze chest images for COVID-19 treatment and their advantages and limitations are presented. In addition to reviewing the rapidly developing techniques, we also summarize publicly accessible lung scan image sets. The article ends with discussions of the challenges in current research and potential directions in designing effective computational solutions to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in the future.

34222268	Immune Response, Viral Shedding Time, and Clinical Characterization in COVID-19 Patients With Gastrointestinal Symptoms. Background and Aims: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are frequently observed in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms. Previous studies have mainly focused on epidemiology and characteristics in patients with GI symptoms, little is known about the roles of the immune response in susceptibility to and severity of infection. Here, we analyzed COVID-19 cases to determine immune response and clinical characteristics in COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms. Methods: Based on the presence of GI symptoms, 79 patients in Xuzhou were divided into GI and non-GI groups. A retrospective study investigating the clinical characteristics, selected laboratory abnormalities, immune response, treatment, and clinical outcome was performed to compare patients with or without GI symptoms. Results: Approximately 25% of patients reported at least one GI symptom. Our results showed significantly higher rates of fatigue, increased LDH, increased CK, higher percentage increase neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphopenia, and bilateral pneumonia in patients with GI symptoms. No significant changes in serum amylase (SAA), immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), viral shedding time, liver injury, and kidney injury between the two groups were observed. The clinical type on admission of patients with GI symptoms reported significantly higher rates of critical disease type (20 vs. 3.3%; p = 0.033). However, the survival rate did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions: Increase in total lymphocytes and NLR as well as the elevation of CRP, SAA, PCT, IL-6, CK, and LDH were closely associated with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, implying reliable indicators COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms were more likely to develop into a severe disease.

34290590	Expression of the ACE2 Virus Entry Protein in the Nervus Terminalis Reveals the Potential for an Alternative Route to Brain Infection in COVID-19. Previous studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may gain access to the brain by using a route along the olfactory nerve. However, there is a general consensus that the obligatory virus entry receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is not expressed in olfactory receptor neurons, and the timing of arrival of the virus in brain targets is inconsistent with a neuronal transfer along olfactory projections. We determined whether nervus terminalis neurons and their peripheral and central projections should be considered as a potential alternative route from the nose to the brain. Nervus terminalis neurons in postnatal mice were double-labeled with antibodies against ACE2 and two nervus terminalis markers, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and choline acetyltransferase (CHAT). We show that a small fraction of CHAT-labeled nervus terminalis neurons, and the large majority of GnRH-labeled nervus terminalis neurons with cell bodies in the region between the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb express ACE2 and cathepsins B and L. Nervus terminalis neurons therefore may provide a direct route for the virus from the nasal epithelium, possibly via innervation of Bowman's glands, to brain targets, including the telencephalon and diencephalon. This possibility needs to be examined in suitable animal models and in human tissues.	Mechanism
34224155	What does COVID-19 testing results really say? The real statistics concealed behind the accessible data. Accurate and comprehensive testing is crucial for practitioners to portray the pandemic. Without testing there is no data; yet, the exact number of infected people cannot be determined due to the lack of comprehensive testing. The number of seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 infection is obviously relative to the extent of testing. However, the true number of infections might be still far higher than the reported values. To compare the countries based on the number of seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 infection is misleading, as there may not be enough tests being carried out to properly monitor the outbreak. In this paper, we closely look through the COVID-19 testing results. Herein, we try to draw conclusions based on the reported data: first, the presence of a possible relationship between COVID-19 transition and patients' age will be assessed. Then, the COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) is compared with the age-demographic data for different countries. Based on the results, a method for estimating a lower bound (minimum) for the number of actual positive cases will be developed and validated. Results of this study have shown that CFR is a metric reflecting the spread of the virus, but is a factor of the extent of testing and does not necessarily show the real size of the outbreak. Moreover, no large difference in susceptibility by age has been found. The results suggest the similarity between the age distribution of COVID-19 and the population age-demographic is improving over the course of the pandemic. In addition, countries with lower CFRs have a more similar COVID-19 age distribution, which is a result of more comprehensive testing. Finally, a method for estimation of the real number of infected people based on the age distributions, reported CFRs, and the extent of testing will be developed and validated.	Diagnosis
34205096	High Rates of Hidden HCV Infections among Hospitalized Patients Aged 55-85. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The WHO has solicited all countries to eliminate HCV by 2030. The Italian government started routine screening for HCV infection in January 2021, initially targeting subjects born between 1969 and 1989. With the aim of achieving micro-elimination, we designed a hospital-wide project focusing on inpatients born from 1935 to 1985 and conducted it in our institution. METHOD: All inpatients aged 35 to 85, admitted from 10 February 2020 to 9 February 2021 for many different diseases and conditions underwent HCV antibody (HCVAb) testing by third-generation ELISA. When positive, reflex HCV RNA testing and genotyping were performed. Clinical history, fibrosis diagnosis, laboratory data and concomitant medications were available for all. RESULTS: The HCV screening rate of inpatients was 100%. In total, 11,748 participants were enrolled, of whom 53.50% were male. The HCVAb positivity rate was 3.03%. The HCVAb rate increased with age and was higher for patients born between 1935 and 1944 (4.81%). The rate of HCV RNA positivity was 0.97%. The vast majority (80.70%) of HCV RNA-positive participants were 55 or older; in about 40% of cases, HCV RNA-positive patients were unaware of their infection. Although 16 patients died after HCV chronic infection diagnosis (two due COVID-19) or HCV treatment prescription (one due to COVID-19), 74.56% of patient HCV diagnoses were linked to HCV treatment, despite their co-morbidities. All patients older than 65 who died had an active HCV infection. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed a rate of active HCV infections among inpatients lower than what has been reported in the past in the general population; this appears to be a result of the widespread use of pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). The overall rate of active infection was lower than the rate observed in the 1935-1954 cohort. The high rate of inpatients unaware of HCV infections and the high number of deaths among subjects with an active HCV infection born from 1935 to 1954, suggest that, at least in southern Italy, targeted screening of this birth cohort may be required to reduce the number of undiagnosed cases and hidden infections.

34202573	Understanding Post Entry Sorting of Adenovirus Capsids; A Chance to Change Vaccine Vector Properties. Adenovirus vector-based genetic vaccines have emerged as a powerful strategy against the SARS-CoV-2 health crisis. This success is not unexpected because adenoviruses combine many desirable features of a genetic vaccine. They are highly immunogenic and have a low and well characterized pathogenic profile paired with technological approachability. Ongoing efforts to improve adenovirus-vaccine vectors include the use of rare serotypes and non-human adenoviruses. In this review, we focus on the viral capsid and how the choice of genotypes influences the uptake and subsequent subcellular sorting. We describe how understanding capsid properties, such as stability during the entry process, can change the fate of the entering particles and how this translates into differences in immunity outcomes. We discuss in detail how mutating the membrane lytic capsid protein VI affects species C viruses' post-entry sorting and briefly discuss if such approaches could have a wider implication in vaccine and/or vector development.

34222275	Persisting Antibody Response to SARS-CoV-2 in a Local Austrian Population. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic recently. The prevalence and persistence of antibodies following a peak SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights into the potential for some level of population immunity. In June 2020, we succeeded in testing almost half of the population of an Austrian town with a higher incidence of COVID-19 infection. We performed a follow-up study to reassess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG antibodies with 68 participants of the previous study. We found that the prevalence of IgG or IgA antibodies remained remarkably stable, with 84% of our cohort prevailing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (only a slight decrease from 93% 4 months before). In most patients with confirmed COVID-19 seroconversion potentially provides immunity to reinfection. Our results suggest a stable antibody response observed for at least 6 months post-infection with implications for developing strategies for testing and protecting the population.	Diagnosis
34199617	The Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Variant(s) and Its Impact on the Prevalence of COVID-19 Cases in the Nabatieh Region, Lebanon. Background: An outbreak of an unknown respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and was referred to as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Soon after, it was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the respiratory tract with different outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe critical illness leading to death. Different SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging of which three have raised concerns worldwide due to their high transmissibility among populations. Objective: To study the prevalence of COVID-19 in the region of Nabatieh-South Lebanon during the past year and assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their effect on the spread of infection during times of lockdown. Methods: In our study, 37,474 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and analyzed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in suspected patients attending a tertiary health care center in South Lebanon during the period between 16 March 2020 and 21 February 2021. Results: The results demonstrated a variation in the prevalence rates ranging from less than 1% during full lockdown of the country to 8.4% upon easing lockdown restrictions and reaching 27.5% after the holidays and 2021 New Year celebrations. Interestingly, a new variant(s) appeared starting January 2021 with a significant positive association between the prevalence of positive tests and the percentage of the variant(s). Conclusions: Our results indicate that the lockdown implemented by the Lebanese officials was an effective intervention to contain COVID-19 spread. Our study also showed that lifting lockdown measures during the holidays, which allowed indoor crowded gatherings to occur, caused a surge in COVID-19 cases and rise in the mortality rates nationwide. More importantly, we confirmed the presence of a highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant(s) circulating in the Lebanese community from at least January 2021 onwards.	Prevention;Transmission
34200441	Optimization of Vero Cells Grown on a Polymer Fiber Carrier in a Disposable Bioreactor for Inactivated Coxsackievirus A16 Vaccine Development. At present, there are no vaccines available for hand, foot, and mouth disease, which is caused by Coxsackie virus A16 (CVA16) infection. In the present study, we isolated epidemic strains of CVA16 and optimized the production of the virus in Vero cells. The system comprised growing the infected cells on polymer fiber paper carriers in a serum-free medium containing 0.5% (w/v) lactalbumin hydrolysate a mini bioreactor. Disposable Bioflo310 and AmProtein Current perfusion bioreactors were used to monitor virus infection and Vero cell culture. The total number of cells increased from 1.5 x 10(9) to 3.0 x 10(10). In our optimized culture process, the virus titer reached 7.8 x 10(7) TCID50/mL at three days after infection. The inactivated CVA16 prepared from our optimized culture procedure elicited a slightly higher neutralizing antibody titer compared with that derived from routine culture procedures. These results will promote the large-scale production of inactivated CVA16 vaccines using nonwoven polymer fiber paper cell cultures.	Treatment
34286818	COVID-19 preparedness: Clinical pharmacy services remote staffing in a quaternary, level I trauma and comprehensive stroke center. PURPOSE: The rapid spread of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has strained the resources of healthcare systems around the world. In accordance with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and US Department of Defense, Intermountain Medical Center (IMED) in Murray, UT, has developed a plan to provide remote clinical pharmacy services to protect the health of pharmacy caregivers while maintaining appropriate clinical pharmacy coverage to optimally care for patients. SUMMARY: The utilization of telemedicine technology permits clinical pharmacists to readily communicate with nurses, physicians, other caregivers, and patients. We have identified strategies to allow clinical pharmacists to continue to participate in daily rounds, provide consultations under collaborative practice agreements, verify medication orders, collect medication histories, provide antimicrobial stewardship, and deliver medication education to patients from off-site locations. The pharmacy department at IMED proactively tested telemedicine technologies, defined the roles of clinical pharmacists, and identified communication strategies prior to a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in the state of Utah. CONCLUSION: The proactive measures described can help ensure that pharmacy caregivers have appropriate remote access and are capable of confidently using the resources. These steps allow for optimal care of hospitalized patients and promote social distancing, which may have the added benefit of decreasing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among patients and caregivers.

34286685	Peridomestic Mammal Susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection. Wild animals have been implicated as the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but it is largely unknown how the virus affects most wildlife species and if wildlife could ultimately serve as a reservoir for maintaining the virus outside the human population. We show that several common peridomestic species, including deer mice, bushy-tailed woodrats, and striped skunks, are susceptible to infection and can shed the virus in respiratory secretions. In contrast, we demonstrate that cottontail rabbits, fox squirrels, Wyoming ground squirrels, black-tailed prairie dogs, house mice, and racoons are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results expand the knowledge base of susceptible species and provide evidence that human-wildlife interactions could result in continued transmission of SARS-CoV-2.	Transmission
34291525	"Genetic counseling, virtual visits, and equity in the era of COVID-19 and beyond. Overnight, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth rapidly transitioned from limited application to widespread implementation. The field of genetic counseling was well positioned to make this transition to virtual care since there is generally less of a need for patients to be seen in-person for physical exams or urgent care. Going forward, virtual visits will presumably become a mainstay in the provision of genetic services and it is anticipated that clinics will adopt ""hybrid"" models with both in-person and virtual visit options. This commentary highlights the successes and challenges in the rapid implementation of virtual visits, focusing on who has benefited versus who has been challenged or left behind. We also discuss genetic testing considerations, including the additional steps required for patients and clinicians when testing is ordered outside of the clinical setting, which can result in delays or a lack of testing altogether. Future research considerations are presented to address the needs among the most vulnerable and help ensure equitable access and benefit."	Prevention
34199085	Dental Education during the COVID-19 Pandemic in a German Dental Hospital. Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, dental treatment performed by undergraduate students at the University of Marburg/Germany was immediately stopped in spring 2020 and stepwise reinstalled under a new hygiene concept until full recovery in winter 2020/21. Patient treatment in the student courses was evaluated based on three aspects: (1) Testing of patients with a SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen (SCRA) Test applied by student assistants (SA); (2) Improved hygiene regimen, with separated treatment units, cross-ventilation, pre-operative mouth rinse and rubber dam application wherever possible; (3) Recruitment of patients: 735 patients were pre-registered for the two courses; 384 patients were treated and a total of 699 tests with the SCRA test were performed by SAs. While half of the patients treated in the course were healthy, over 40% of the patients that were pre-registered but not treated in the course revealed a disease being relevant to COVID (p < 0.001). 46 patients had concerns to visit the dental hospital due to the increase of COVID incidence levels, 14 persons refused to be tested. The presented concept was suitable to enable patient treatment in the student course during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.	Prevention
34352699	Conventional and microfluidic methods for airborne virus isolation and detection. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the threat of infectious diseases to public health and safety has become much more apparent. Viral, bacterial and fungal diseases have led to the loss of millions of lives, especially in the developing world. Diseases caused by airborne viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are difficult to control, as these viruses are easily transmissible and can circulate in the air for hours. To contain outbreaks of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and institute targeted precautions, it is important to detect them in air and understand how they infect their targets. Point-of-care (PoC) diagnostics and point-of-need (PoN) detection methods are necessary to rapidly test patient and environmental samples, so precautions can immediately be applied. Traditional benchtop detection methods such as ELISA, PCR and culture are not suitable for PoC and PoN monitoring, because they can take hours to days and require specialized equipment. Microfluidic devices can be made at low cost to perform such assays rapidly and at the PoN. They can also be integrated with air- and liquid-based sampling technologies to capture and analyze viruses from air and body fluids. Here, conventional and microfluidic virus detection methods are reviewed and compared. The use of air sampling devices to capture and concentrate viruses is discussed first, followed by a review of analysis methods such as immunoassays, RT-PCR and isothermal amplification in conventional and microfluidic platforms. This review provides an overview of the capabilities of microfluidics in virus handling and detection, which will be useful to infectious disease researchers, biomedical engineers, and public health agencies.

34208194	Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthcare-Seeking Behaviors among Frequent Emergency Department Users: A Cohort Study. In 2020, Taiwan's healthcare system faced a notable burden imposed by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Emergency department (ED) is a high-risk area for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission. The effect of COVID-19 on the utilization of ED services among frequent ED users remains unknown. This cohort study determined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-seeking behaviors among frequent ED users at Taipei City Hospital, Taiwan. We included ED users aged >/= 18 years admitted to Taipei City Hospital during February 2019-January 2020 (before the pandemic) and February 2020-January 2021 (during the pandemic). Frequent ED users were patients with four or more ED visits per year. Stepwise logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of frequent ED use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Frequent ED users had shorter hospital stays in the ED during the pandemic. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and other covariates, patients with a triage status of level 4-5, pneumonia diagnosis, giddiness, or dyspnea were more likely frequent ED visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic. To reduce the risk of acquiring COVID-19, it is important to utilize territorial healthcare or telehealth to avoid inappropriate ED visits for patients with a low level of risk or chronic disease.

34344393	Pharmacist dispensing of the abortion pill in Canada: Diffusion of Innovation meets integrated knowledge translation. BACKGROUND: Since Canadian drug regulatory approval of mifepristone for medical abortion in 2015 and its market availability in January 2017, the role of pharmacists in abortion provision has changed rapidly. We sought to identify the factors that influenced the initiation and provision of medical abortion from the perspectives of Canadian pharmacists, bridging two frameworks - Diffusion of Innovation in Health Service Organizations and integrated knowledge translation. METHODS: We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with pharmacists residing in Canada who intended to stock and dispense mifepristone within the first year of availability. Our data collection, analysis, and interpretation were guided by reflexive thematic analysis and supported by an integrated knowledge translation partnership with pharmacy stakeholders. RESULTS: We completed interviews with 24 participants from across Canada: 33% had stocked and 21% had dispensed mifepristone. We found that pharmacists were willing and able to integrate medical abortion care into their practice and that those who had initiated practice were satisfied with their dispensing experience. Our analysis indicated that several key Diffusion of Innovation constructs impacted the uptake of mifepristone, including: innovation (relative advantage, complexity and compatibility, technical support), system readiness (innovation-system fit, dedicated time, resources), diffusion and dissemination (expert opinion, boundary spanners, champions, social networks, peer opinions), implementation (external collaboration), and linkage. Participants' experiences suggest that integrated knowledge translation facilitated evidence-based changes to mifepristone dispensing restrictions, and communication of those changes to front line pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate how Diffusion of Innovation and integrated knowledge translation may work together as complimentary frameworks for implementation science research. Unlike in the USA, UK, and other highly regulated settings globally, pharmacists in Canada are permitted to dispense mifepristone for medical abortion. We contribute to literature that shows that mifepristone dispensed outside of hospitals, clinics, and medical offices is safe and acceptable to both patients and prescribers. This finding is of particular importance to the current COVID-19 pandemic response and calls for continued and equitable access to abortion care in primary practice.	Prevention
34286447	COVID 19 disease independently predicted endothelial dysfunction measured by flow-mediated dilatation. The systemic effects of COVID-19 disease are still largely uncertain and needs to be scrutinized with further trials. Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is responsible for the majority of adverse cardiovascular events. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is easily obtainable method to assess ED accurately. It is aimed to evaluate ED by measuring FMD following COVID-19 disease. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 disease were recruited to the hospital two month after the discharge. Sex and age-matched healthy subjects were determined as the control group. Blood samples and FMD measurements were obtained from each participant. All subjects were divided into two groups according to the presence of ED determined by FMD measurements. These two groups were compared in terms of demographic features and the presence of recovered COVID-19 disease. A total of 92 subjects consisting of 59 without ED and 33 with ED were included in the study. ED (+) group was older (p = 0.015) and more likely to have hypertension (p = 0.044) and COVID-19 rate was higher in ED (+) group (p = 0.009). While neutrophil count (p = 0.047) and CRP (p = 0.036) were higher, eGFR (p = 0.044) was lower in ED (+) group. In the backward multivariable regression analysis, COVID-19 disease [OR = 3.611, 95% CI 1.069-12.198, p = 0.039] and BMI [OR = 1.122, 95% CI 1.023-1.231, p = 0.015] were independent predictors of ED. COVID-19 disease may cause ED which is the major underlying factor of cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, COVID-19 disease may deteriorate the existing cardiovascular disease course. Detecting ED in the early phase or preventing by new treatment modalities may improve short and long-term outcome.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34204122	A Cross-Sectional Study of SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence between Fall 2020 and February 2021 in Allegheny County, Western Pennsylvania, USA. Seroprevalence studies are important for understanding the dynamics of local virus transmission and evaluating community immunity. To assess the seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in Allegheny County, an urban/suburban county in Western PA, 393 human blood samples collected in Fall 2020 and February 2021 were examined for spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N) antibodies. All RBD-positive samples were evaluated for virus-specific neutralization activity. Our results showed a seroprevalence of 5.5% by RBD ELISA, 4.5% by N ELISA, and 2.5% for both in Fall 2020, which increased to 24.7% by RBD ELISA, 14.9% by N ELISA, and 12.9% for both in February 2021. Neutralization titer was significantly correlated with RBD titer but not with N titer. Using these two assays, we were able to distinguish infected from vaccinated individuals. In the February cohort, higher median income and white race were associated with serological findings consistent with vaccination. This study demonstrates a 4.5-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from Fall 2020 to February 2021 in Allegheny County, PA, due to increased incidence of both natural disease and vaccination. Future seroprevalence studies will need to include the effect of vaccination on assay results and incorporate non-vaccine antigens in serological assessments.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34198945	COVID-19 Impact on Musculoskeletal Regenerative Medicine Research: Maintaining Lab Continuity. BACKGROUND: Research in the fields of musculoskeletal tissue engineering and regenerative medicine may suffer a slowdown during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic emergency. This is likely to harm the development of new therapeutic strategies and their translation into the clinic in the long term. Recently, the need to maintain continuity in research activities in those fields has assumed even greater importance due to the accumulation of data concerning the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the musculoskeletal system. This study is aimed at the identification of a series of safe handling practices against COVID-19 diffusion to apply in a research environment, thus allowing the maintenance of research lab activities. METHODS: The control measures to apply to mitigate the COVID-19 risk were identified and categorized utilizing the Hierarchy of Controls. We also compared our analysis with that assessed before the pandemic to consider the additional risk of COVID-19. RESULTS: Results highlighted that the most relevant implemented measures to control SARS-CoV-2 were based on protecting people through engineering (e.g., ventilation and social distancing), and administrative (e.g., hand sanitization, work shifts) measures or Personnel Protective Equipment, rather than eliminating hazards at the source (e.g., smart working). CONCLUSIONS: Work continuity in research labs during the COVID-19 emergency should be guaranteed by ensuring the protection of researchers in the workplace and considering the physical environment, the type of operators and work activity, and the proven ability of workers to face biological risks. The increased knowledge and awareness on lab' risks should be useful to prevent and mitigate future viral outbreaks.	Prevention
34343467	"Suitability of Google Trends for digital surveillance during ongoing COVID-19 epidemic: a case study from India. OBJECTIVE: Digital surveillance has shown mixed results as supplement to traditional surveillance. Google Trends (GT) has been used for digital surveillance of H1N1, Ebola and MERS. We used GT to correlate the information seeking on COVID-19 with number of tests and cases in India. METHODS: We obtained data on daily tests and cases from WHO, ECDC and covid19india.org. We used a comprehensive search strategy to retrieve GT data on COVID-19 related information-seeking behaviour in India between 1st January and 31st May 2020 in the form of relative search volume (RSV). We used time-lag correlation analysis to assess the temporal relationships between RSV and daily new COVID-19 cases and tests. RESULTS: GT RSV showed high time-lag correlation with both daily reported tests and cases for the terms ""COVID 19"", ""COVID"", ""social distancing"", ""soap"" and ""lockdown"" at national level. In five high-burden states, high correlation was observed for these five terms along with ""Corona"". Peaks in RSV both at national level and high-burden states corresponded with media coverage or government declarations on the ongoing pandemic. CONCLUSION: The correlation observed between GT data and COVID-19 tests/cases in India may be either due to media-coverage induced curiosity or health-seeking."	Prevention

Lack of effective clinical drugs for most viral diseases emphasizes the need for speedy and accurate diagnosis at early stages of infection to prevent rapid spread of the pathogens. Glycans are important molecules which are involved in different biological recognition processes, especially in the spread of infection by mediating virus interaction with endothelial cells. Thus, novel strategies based on nanotechnology have been developed for identifying and inhibiting viruses in a fast, selective, and precise way. The nanosized nature of nanomaterials and their exclusive optical, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical features can improve patient care through using sensors with minimal invasiveness and extreme sensitivity. This review provides an overview of the latest advances of functionalized glyconanomaterials, for rapid and selective biosensing detection of molecules as biomarkers or specific glycoproteins and as novel promising antiviral agents for different kinds of serious viruses, such as the Dengue virus, Ebola virus, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, Zika virus, or coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).

34223865	Prevention of the spread of SARS COV-2 by Rapid Antigenic Tests on the passengers entering an Italian seaport. Abstract: Out of 38,282 passengers entering Italy at a major seaport, submitted to SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigenic test, 272 (0.6%) resulted positive and 212 (93.4%) were confirmed positive by qRT-PCR, leaving a 0.6% of false positive. Those resident in the area under control of the same Local Health Authority of the seaport were immediately submitted to isolation and investigated for contact tracing, the others notified to their Local Health Authority which did the same in the following day. This procedure was made possible by a full-time dedication of the local healthcare workers who managed all the passengers disembarking around the clock along the months of the emergency.	Prevention
34289974	Metabolomic analyses reveals new stage-specific features of the COVID-19. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has affected more than 160 million of individuals and caused millions of deaths worldwide at least in part due to the unclarified pathophysiology of this disease. Therefore, identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 is critical to overcome this pandemic. Metabolites mirror the disease progression of an individual by acquiring extensive insights into the pathophysiological significance during disease progression. We provide a comprehensive view of metabolic characterization of sera from COVID-19 patients at all stages using untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis. As compared with the healthy controls, we observed different alteration patterns of circulating metabolites from the mild, severe and recovery stages, in both discovery cohort and validation cohort, which suggest that metabolic reprogramming of glucose metabolism and urea cycle are potential pathological mechanisms for COVID-19 progression. Our findings suggest that targeting glucose metabolism and urea cycle may be a viable approach to fight against COVID-19 at various stages along the disease course.	Mechanism;Treatment
34202515	Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in SARS-CoV-2- and Chlamydia pneumoniae-Associated Cardiovascular Diseases. Throughout the years, a growing number of studies have provided evidence that oxidative stress and inflammation may be involved in the pathogenesis of infectious agent-related cardiovascular diseases. Amongst the numerous respiratory pathogens, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus responsible for the global ongoing pandemic, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, a widely known intracellular obligate bacteria, seem to have an essential role in promoting reactive oxygen species and cytokine production. The present review highlights the common oxidative and inflammatory molecular pathways underlying the cardiovascular diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 or C. pneumoniae infections. The main therapeutic and preventive approaches using natural antioxidant compounds will be also discussed.	Mechanism;Treatment
34200766	Estimates and Determinants of SARS-Cov-2 Seroprevalence and Infection Fatality Ratio Using Latent Class Analysis: The Population-Based Tirschenreuth Study in the Hardest-Hit German County in Spring 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality ratios (IFR) remain controversially discussed with implications for political measures. The German county of Tirschenreuth suffered a severe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in spring 2020, with particularly high case fatality ratio (CFR). To estimate seroprevalence, underreported infections, and IFR for the Tirschenreuth population aged >/=14 years in June/July 2020, we conducted a population-based study including home visits for the elderly, and analyzed 4203 participants for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies via three antibody tests. Latent class analysis yielded 8.6% standardized county-wide seroprevalence, a factor of underreported infections of 5.0, and 2.5% overall IFR. Seroprevalence was two-fold higher among medical workers and one third among current smokers with similar proportions of registered infections. While seroprevalence did not show an age-trend, the factor of underreported infections was 12.2 in the young versus 1.7 for >/=85-year-old. Age-specific IFRs were <0.5% below 60 years of age, 1.0% for age 60-69, and 13.2% for age 70+. Senior care homes accounted for 45% of COVID-19-related deaths, reflected by an IFR of 7.5% among individuals aged 70+ and an overall IFR of 1.4% when excluding senior care home residents from our computation. Our data underscore senior care home infections as key determinant of IFR additionally to age, insufficient targeted testing in the young, and the need for further investigations on behavioral or molecular causes of the fewer infections among current smokers.

34333497	"Breathlessness and COVID-19: A Call for Research. Breathlessness, also known as dyspnoea, is a debilitating and frequent symptom. Several reports have highlighted the lack of dyspnoea in a subgroup of patients suffering from COVID-19, sometimes referred to as ""silent"" or ""happy hyp-oxaemia."" Reports have also mentioned the absence of a clear relationship between the clinical severity of the disease and levels of breathlessness reported by patients. The cerebral complications of COVID-19 have been largely demonstrated with a high prevalence of an acute encephalopathy that could possibly affect the processing of afferent signals or top-down modulation of breathlessness signals. In this review, we aim to highlight the mechanisms involved in breathlessness and summarize the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and its known effects on the brain-lung interaction. We then offer hypotheses for the alteration of breathlessness perception in COVID-19 patients and suggest ways of further researching this phenomenon."	Mechanism;Treatment;Diagnosis
34286893	Potency of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 variants of concern: A systematic review of in vitro studies. BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are two types of mRNA-based vaccine platforms that have received emergency use authorization. The emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) variants has raised concerns of reduced sensitivity to neutralization by their elicited antibodies. We aimed to systematically review the most recent in vitro studies evaluating the effectiveness of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 induced neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science in addition to bioRxiv and medRxiv with terms including 'SARS-CoV-2', 'BNT162b2', 'mRNA-1273', and 'neutralizing antibody' up to June 29, 2021. A modified version of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist was used for assessing included study quality. A total 36 in vitro studies meeting the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review. B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) are four SARS-CoV-2 variants that have recently been identified as variants of concern. Included studies implemented different methods regarding pseudovirus or live virus neutralization assays for measuring neutralization titres against utilized viruses. After two dose vaccination by BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, the B.1.351 variant had the least sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies, while B.1.1.7 variant had the most sensitivity; that is, it was better neutralized relative to the comparator strain. P.1 and B.1.617.2 variants had an intermediate level of impaired naturalization activity of antibodies elicited by prior vaccination. Our review suggests that immune sera derived from vaccinated individuals might show reduced protection of individuals immunized with mRNA vaccines against more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

34200990	The Right Ventricle in COVID-19. Infection with the novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) results in COVID-19, a disease primarily affecting the respiratory system to provoke a spectrum of clinical manifestations, the most severe being acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients also develop various cardiac complications, among which dysfunction of the right ventricle (RV) appears particularly common, especially in severe forms of the disease, and which is associated with a dismal prognosis. Echocardiographic studies indeed reveal right ventricular dysfunction in up to 40% of patients, a proportion even greater when the RV is explored with strain imaging echocardiography. The pathophysiological mechanisms of RV dysfunction in COVID-19 include processes increasing the pulmonary vascular hydraulic load and others reducing RV contractility, which precipitate the acute uncoupling of the RV with the pulmonary circulation. Understanding these mechanisms provides the fundamental basis for the adequate therapeutic management of RV dysfunction, which incorporates protective mechanical ventilation, the prevention and treatment of pulmonary vasoconstriction and thrombotic complications, as well as the appropriate management of RV preload and contractility. This comprehensive review provides a detailed update of the evidence of RV dysfunction in COVID-19, its pathophysiological mechanisms, and its therapy.	Mechanism;Treatment
34285538	Prevalence and Characteristics of Rheumatoid-Associated Autoantibodies in Patients with COVID-19. Objective: Patients with rheumatic immune diseases were more likely to develop severe or critical COVID-19. We aimed to determine whether rheumatoid factor antibodies were present in COVID patients and the level and type of rheumatoid factor antibodies produced in COVID-19 patients were related to the degree of the patient's condition. The study also aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of rheumatoid factor antibodies in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Sera collected from 129 patients with COVID-19 were tested for rheumatoid factor antibodies by ELISA. Five patients were tracked for several months to monitor dynamic changes of these antibodies. Results: Rheumatoid-associated autoantibodies were detected in 20.16% of patients (26/129) following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition, IgM-RF was primarily present in critically ill patients, while IgA-RF was mainly present in mild patients. Five patients were able to track for several months to monitor dynamic changes of these antibodies. Rheumatoid factor antibodies peaks in the later phase of the disease and last for longer time. Anti-Jo-1 antibody was found in one of the five patients. Conclusion: This was the case series report that rheumatoid-associated autoantibodies are present in patients with COVID-19. The clinical significance of these antibodies was not fully understood and needed further characterization. These autoantibodies are related to the severity of the patient's disease and exist for a long time in the patient's body, while their impact on the patient's health is unknown.	Case Report
34287354	Viral Load Difference between Symptomatic and Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the possible difference in the SARS-CoV-2 viral load between asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar for all investigations in the English language, reporting data on the threshold cycle (Ct) from real-time RT-PCR assays for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) SARS-CoV-2 genes in asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Results: Overall, 703 COVID-19 patients (553 symptomatic and 150 asymptomatic) were analyzed. Five investigations reported the mean age of patients, evidencing that asymptomatic patients were younger than symptomatic patients (34.0 vs. 40.3 years, respectively). Pooled data regarding the levels of expression of the RdRp gene revealed no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Similarly, no differences were observed comparing the mean Ct values for the E and N genes. Based on real-time RT-PCR data, no differences exist in the viral load between symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 subjects considering Ct values for RdRp, E and N genes' expression. Asymptomatic subjects may represent a reservoir of the infection and significantly contribute to the maintenance of the pandemic.	Diagnosis
34200500	How SARS-CoV-2 and Other Viruses Build an Invasion Route to Hijack the Host Nucleocytoplasmic Trafficking System. The host nucleocytoplasmic trafficking system is often hijacked by viruses to accomplish their replication and to suppress the host immune response. Viruses encode many factors that interact with the host nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) and the nucleoporins of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to access the host nucleus. In this review, we discuss the viral factors and the host factors involved in the nuclear import and export of viral components. As nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is vital for the replication of many viruses, we also review several drugs that target the host nuclear transport machinery and discuss their feasibility for use in antiviral treatment.

34223190	Electrocardiographic Findings and In-Hospital Mortality of COVID-19 Patients; a Retrospective Cohort Study. Background: Although current evidence points to the possible prognostic value of electrocardiographic (ECG) findings for in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients, most of these studies have been performed on a small sample size. In this study, our aim was to investigate the ECG changes as prognostic indicators of in-hospital mortality. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, the findings of the first and the second ECGs of COVID-19 patients were extracted and changes in the ECGs were examined. Any abnormal finding in the second ECG that wasn't present in the initial ECG at the time of admission was defined as an ECG change. ECGs were interpreted by a cardiologist and the prognostic value of abnormal ECG findings for in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients was evaluated using multivariate analysis and the report of the relative risk (RR). Results: Data of the ECGs recorded at the time of admission were extracted from the files of 893 patients; likewise, the second ECGs could be extracted from the records of 328 patients who had an initial ECG. The presence of sinus tachycardia (RR = 2.342; p <0.001), supraventricular arrhythmia (RR = 1.688; p = 0.001), ventricular arrhythmia (RR = 1.854; p = 0.011), interventricular conduction delays (RR = 1.608; p = 0.009), and abnormal R wave progression (RR = 1.766; p = 0.001) at the time of admission were independent prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality. In the second ECG, sinus tachycardia (RR = 2.222; p <0.001), supraventricular arrhythmia (RR = 1.632; p <0.001), abnormal R wave progression (RR = 2.151; p = 0.009), and abnormal T wave (RR = 1.590; p = 0.001) were also independent prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality. Moreover, by comparing the first and the second ECGs, it was found that the incidence of supraventricular arrhythmia (RR = 1.973; p = 0.005) and ST segment elevation/depression (RR = 2.296; p <0.001) during hospitalization (ECG novel changes) are two independent prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Due to the fact that using electrocardiographic data is easy and accessible and it is easy to continuously monitor patients with this tool, ECGs can be useful in identifying high-risk COVID-19 patients for mortality.

34225565	Plant derived active compounds as potential anti SARS-CoV-2 agents: an in-silico study. Plants are a valued potential source of drugs for a variety of diseases and are often considered less toxic to humans. We investigated antiviral compounds that may potentially target SARS-CoV-2 antigenic spike (S) and host proteins; angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2), and transmembrane serine protease2 (TMPRSS2). We scrutinized 36 phytochemicals from 15 Indian medicinal plants known to be effective against RNA viruses via molecular docking. Besides, the TMPRSS2 structure was modeled and validated using the SWISS-MODEL. Docking was performed using Autodock Vina and 4.2 followed by visualization of the docking poses on Pymol version 2.4.0 and Discovery Studio Visualizer. Molecular docking showed that 12 out of 36 active compounds interacted efficiently with S, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 proteins. The ADMET profile generated using the swissADME and pkCSM server revealed that these compounds were possessed druggable properties. The Amber 12 simulation package was used to carry out energy minimizations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The total simulation time for both S protein: WFA and S protein: WND complexes was 300 ns (100 ns per replica). A total of 120 structures were extracted from the last 60 ns of each MD simulation for further analysis. MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA were employed to assess the binding energy of each ligand and the receptor-binding domain of the viral S-protein. The methods suggested that WND and WFA showed thermodynamically favorable binding energies, and the S protein had a higher affinity with WND. Interestingly, Leu455 hotspot residue in the S protein, also predicted to participate in binding with ACE2, was engaged by WND and WFA. HighlightsPlants' natural active compounds may aid in the development of COVID-19 therapeutics.MD simulation study revealed stable binding of withanolide D and withaferin A with spike proteinWithanolide D and withaferin A could be effective against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.Discovery of druggable agents that have less or lack of binding affinity with ACE2 to avoid the organs associated with comorbidities.According to ADMET selected phytochemicals may be used as druggable compounds.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

34226872	Fractional Model and Numerical Algorithms for Predicting COVID-19 with Isolation and Quarantine Strategies. In December 2019, a new outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted world-wide attention, the virus then spread rapidly in most countries of the world, the objective of this paper is to investigate the mathematical modelling and dynamics of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) with Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative in the presence of quarantine and isolation strategies. The existence and uniqueness of the solutions for the fractional model is proved using fixed point iterations, the fractional model are shown to have disease-free and an endemic equilibrium point.We construct a fractional version of the four-steps Adams-Bashforth method as well as the error estimate of this method. We have used this method to determine the numerical scheme of this model and Matlab program to illustrate the evolution of the virus in some countries (Morocco, Qatar, Brazil and Mexico) as well as to support theoretical results. The Least squares fitting is a way to find the best fit curve or line for a set of points, so we apply this method in this paper to construct an algorithm to estimate the parameters of fractional model as well as the fractional order, this model gives an estimate better than that of classical model.

34218862	Quantifying the Importance of COVID-19 Vaccination to Our Future Outlook. Predictive models have played a critical role in local, national, and international response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, health care systems and governmental agencies have relied on several models, such as the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Youyang Gu (YYG), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ensemble, to predict short- and long-term trends in disease activity. The Mayo Clinic Bayesian SIR model, recently made publicly available, has informed Mayo Clinic practice leadership at all sites across the United States and has been shared with Minnesota governmental leadership to help inform critical decisions during the past year. One key to the accuracy of the Mayo Clinic model is its ability to adapt to the constantly changing dynamics of the pandemic and uncertainties of human behavior, such as changes in the rate of contact among the population over time and by geographic location and now new virus variants. The Mayo Clinic model can also be used to forecast COVID-19 trends in different hypothetical worlds in which no vaccine is available, vaccinations are no longer being accepted from this point forward, and 75% of the population is already vaccinated. Surveys indicate that half of American adults are hesitant to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and lack of understanding of the benefits of vaccination is an important barrier to use. The focus of this paper is to illustrate the stark contrast between these 3 scenarios and to demonstrate, mathematically, the benefit of high vaccine uptake on the future course of the pandemic.

34292611	Clinical and histopathological spectrum of delayed adverse cutaneous reactions following COVID-19 vaccination. BACKGROUND: As more people become vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, reports of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions are beginning to emerge. METHODS: In this IRB-approved retrospective case series, biopsy specimens of potential cutaneous adverse reactions from the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine were identified and reviewed. Clinical information was obtained through the requisition form, referring clinician, or medical chart review. RESULTS: Twelve cases were included. Histopathological features from two injection-site reactions showed a mixed-cell infiltrate with eosinophils and a spongiotic dermatitis with eosinophils. Three biopsy specimens came from generalized eruptions that showed interface changes consistent with an exanthematous drug reaction. Three biopsy specimens revealed a predominantly spongiotic pattern, consistent with eczematous dermatitis. Small-vessel vascular injury was seen in two specimens, which were diagnosed as urticarial vasculitis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis, respectively. There were two cases of new-onset bullous pemphigoid supported by histopathological examination and direct immunofluorescence studies. Eosinophils were seen in 10 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Dermatopathologists should be aware of potential cutaneous adverse reactions to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Histopathological patterns include mixed-cell infiltrates, epidermal spongiosis, and interface changes. Eosinophils are a common finding but are not always present. Direct immunofluorescence studies may be helpful for immune-mediated cutaneous presentations such as vasculitis or bullous pemphigoid.	Treatment
34285709	Effects of the Na(+)/H(+) Ion Exchanger on Susceptibility to COVID-19 and the Course of the Disease. The Na(+)/H(+) ion exchanger (NHE) pumps Na(+) inward the cell and H(+) ion outside the cell. NHE activity increases in response to a decrease in intracellular pH, and it maintains intracellular pH in a narrow range. Patients with obesity, diabetes, and hypertension and the elderly are prone to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The angiotensin II (Ang II) level is high in chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Ang II is the main stimulator of NHE, and an increased Ang II level causes prolonged NHE activation in these patients. The long-term increase in NHE activity causes H(+) ions to leave the cell in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Increasing H(+) ions outside the cell lead to an increase in oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species. H(+) ion flows into the cell due to the increased oxidative stress. This vicious circle causes intracellular pH to drop. Although NHE is activated when intracellular pH decreases, there is prolonged NHE activation in chronic diseases such as aforementioned. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progression may be more severe and mortal in these patients. SARS-CoV-2 readily invades the cell at low intracellular pH and causes infection. The renin-angiotensin system and NHE play a vital role in regulating intracellular pH. The reduction of NHE activity or its prolonged activation may cause susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection by lowering intracellular pH in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Prolonged NHE activation in these patients with COVID-19 may worsen the course of the disease. Scientists continue to investigate the mechanism of the disease and the factors that affect its clinical progression.	Mechanism;Treatment
34358019	Antibodies Targeting Two Epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 Neutralize Pseudoviruses with the Spike Proteins from Different Variants. The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. To prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, an effective vaccine is required. Two linear peptides from potential B-cell epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (a.a. 440-460; a.a. 494-506) were synthesized and used to immunize rabbits. High-titer antibodies of IgG were produced, purified, and verified by Western blot analysis. Antibodies against these two epitopes could effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral particles with the spike proteins from not only the original strain (basal; wild-type), but also a strain with a single point mutation (D614G), and two other emerging variants (the Alpha and Beta variants) prevalent around the world, but not from SARS-CoV. In conclusion, antibodies against these two epitopes are protective. This information is important for the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.	Mechanism;Treatment
34334353	A hospital cluster of COVID-19 associated with a SARS-CoV-2 superspreading event. BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Superspreading events (SSEs) are pivotal in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to investigate an SSE of COVID-19 in a hospital and explore the transmission dynamics and heterogeneity of SSE. METHODS: We performed contact tracing for all close contacts in a cluster. We did nasopharyngeal or throat swabbing for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR. Environmental survey was performed. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the SSE were studied. RESULTS: Patient 1 with congestive heart failure and cellulitis, who had onset of COVID-19 two weeks after hospitalization, was the index case. Patient 1 led to 8 confirmed cases, including four health care workers (HCW). Persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were HCW (n = 4), patient 1's family (n = 2), an accompanying person of an un-infected in-patient (n = 1), and an in-patient admitted before the SSE (n = 1). The attack rate among the HCW was 3.2 % (4/127). Environmental survey confirmed contamination at the bed rails, mattresses, and sink in the room patient 1 stayed, suggesting fomite transmission. The index case's sputum remained positive on illness day 35. Except one asymptomatic patient, at least three patients acquired the infection from the index case at the pre-symptomatic period. The effective reproduction number (Rt) was 0.9 (8/9). CONCLUSION: The host factor (heart failure, longer viral shedding), transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (Rt, pre-symptomatic transmission), and possible multiple modes of transmission altogether contributed to the SSE. Rapid response and advance deployment of multi-level protection in hospitals could mitigate COVID-19 transmission to one generation, thereby reducing its impact on the healthcare system.	Case Report
34209072	Factors Affecting COVID-19 Preventive Behaviors among University Students in Beijing, China: An Empirical Study Based on the Extended Theory of Planned Behavior. Higher education institutions (HEIs), among other social systems, have an irreplaceable role in combating COVID-19. However, we know little about institutional and individual factors that might facilitate university students' beliefs and behaviors toward preventive behaviors for COVID-19 within the higher education context. Our study applies an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) model to investigate the structural relationships among the institutional climate, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and preventive behaviors of university students and to detect the moderating impacts of perceived risk on the structural model. Data were collected from 3693 university students at 18 universities in Beijing, China through an online survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and multigroup analysis were performed to examine the empirical model. The results reveal that (1) the institutional climate has a significant, direct effect on preventive behaviors for COVID-19 among university students, (2) the TPB components, namely attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control, partially mediate the relationship between the institutional climate and preventive behaviors for COVID-19, and (3) perceived risk moderates several paths in the model. Theoretical and practical implications are offered, and recommendations for future research are outlined.	Prevention
34216498	Isothermal amplification-based assays for rapid and sensitive detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: Opportunities and recent developments. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To date, the virus has been detected in 219 countries of the world. Therefore, managing the disease becomes the priority, in which detecting the presence of the virus is a crucial step. Presently, real-time RT polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is considered a gold standard nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). The test protocol of RT-qPCR is complicated, places high demands on equipment, testing reagents, research personnel skills and is expensive. Therefore, simpler point-of-care (POC) tests are needed to accelerate clinical decision-making and take some of the workload from centralized test laboratories. Various isothermal amplification-based assays have been developed for the sensitive detection of different microorganisms, and recently some of them have been applied for detection of SARS-CoV-2. These do not require any programable thermocycler, can produce the results in a single temperature, and therefore, are considered simple. Unlike RT-qPCR, these methods are highly sensitive, specific, less time-consuming, simple and affordable, and can be used as POC diagnostic kit for COVID-19. In this review, we have discussed the potential of isothermal amplification-based assays as an alternative to RT-qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.	Diagnosis
34206074	Cardiac Involvement in COVID-19 Patients: A Contemporary Review. Background: The widely variable clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV2 disease (COVID-19) range from asymptomatic infections to multiple organ failure and death. Among the organs affected is the heart. This does not only affect people who already have previous cardiovascular problems, but also healthy people. This is a reason not to overlook any symptoms or to perform targeted examinations, even if apparently unrelated to the heart, for quick recognition and timely therapy. Aim of the study: This review recapitulates the current state of knowledge on the potential mechanisms and manifestation of myocarditis in patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods: A web-based search of published data was performed for all relevant studies on patients diagnosed with a COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis, and a total of 50 reports were included. The analysis of the studies evaluated highlights a male predominance, with the average age of patients being 55 years. The most common presenting symptoms included fever, shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Among ECG changes, non-specific ST-segment and T-wave amplitude alterations and ventricular tachycardia episodes were reported. Finally, we wanted to use a general evaluation without distinguishing between various countries, taking into consideration only the peer or reviewer, regardless of the declared value of the journals that have been published. Results and critical findings: The most common presenting symptoms included fever, shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Among ECG changes, non-specific ST-segment and T-wave amplitude alterations and ventricular tachycardia episodes were reported. In most patients, elevated levels of cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers were measured. Left ventricular dysfunction and hypokinesis were commonly exhibited symptoms. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) confirmed the diagnosis of myocarditis with features of cardiac edema and cardiac injury. Nine patients underwent histopathological examination. Treatment with corticosteroids and immunoglobulins was the most applied strategy following the administration of antivirals. Discussion: Despite the exponentially growing knowledge on the management of COVID-19 infection, current available data on SARS-CoV2-correlated myocarditis are still limited, and several difficulties may be encountered in the differential diagnosis of acute myocarditis in the context of COVID-19 disease. Conclusions: While diagnostic criteria and evaluation strategies for myocarditis are well described, no guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of myocarditis in COVID-19 patients have yet been established. Therefore, further research is needed to advance the understanding of this disease process and define the most appropriate strategic approach in these patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34216134	Korean Society of Infectious Diseases/National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency Recommendations for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibody Treatment of Patients with COVID-19. Neutralizing antibodies targeted at the receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein have been developed and now under evaluation in clinical trials. The US Food and Drug Administration currently issued emergency use authorizations for neutralizing monoclonal antibodies in non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at high risk for progressing to severe disease and/or hospitalization. In terms of this situation, there is an urgent need to investigate the clinical aspects and to develop strategies to deploy them effectively in clinical practice. Here we provide guidance for the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the latest evidence.	Treatment
34203929	Dose-Related Aberrant Inhibition of Intracellular Perforin Expression by S1 Subunit of Spike Glycoprotein That Contains Receptor-Binding Domain from SARS-CoV-2. Studies had shown that severe cases of COVID-19 tend to have high viral loads and correlate with functional impairment of cytotoxic lymphocytes, and the features of cytokine storm syndrome are similar to manifestations of severe influenza that have been partially explained by suppressed perforin expression. To test the hypothesis that the spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 may inhibit the perforin expression, we determined the kinetics of immune responses of CD8+ T cells to low dose (LD) or high dose (HD) of S1 stimulation through an in vitro dendritic cell (DC)-T cell model over seven days of incubation. The cytotoxic activity and intracellular perforin expression of CD8+ T cells induced by HD-S1-presenting DCs were aberrantly lower than those induced by LD-S1-presenting DCs from day three of incubation. Discrepantly, the levels of lymphoproliferation and cytokine (interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) production induced by HD-S1-presenting DCs were significantly higher than those induced by LD-S1-presenting DCs from day four. The dose-related responses between doses of S1 and intracellular perforin expression showed a significant linear correlation with a negative slope. In conclusion, the S1 subunit may suppress the perforin expression in CD8+ T cells to decrease the cytotoxic capacity to kill spike-presenting cells in a dose-dependent manner; the persistence of antigen presentation may result in an overproduction of interferon-gamma and subsequent proinflammatory cytokines. That may help explain the insufficient cytotoxicity against high quantities of viruses or highly replicated strains of SARS-CoV-2 in severe cases of COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34223367	Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and mortality in Swiss Cantons with high and low COVID-19 incidence: A nationwide analysis. Aims: Many countries reported an increase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, all these data refer to regional settings and national data are still missing. We aimed to assess the OHCA incidence and population mortality during COVID-19 pandemic in whole Switzerland and in the different regions (Cantons) according to the infection rate. Methods: We considered OHCAs and deaths which occurred in Switzerland after the first diagnosed case of COVID-19 (February 25th) and for the subsequent 65 days and in the same period in 2019. We also compared Cantons with high versus low COVID-19 incidence. Results: A 2.4% reduction in OHCA cases was observed in Switzerland. The reduction was particularly high (-21.4%) in high-incidence COVID-19 cantons, whilst OHCAs increased by 7.7% in low-incidence COVID-19 cantons. Mortality increased by 8.6% in the entire nation: a 27.8% increase in high-incidence cantons and a slight decrease (-0.7%) in low-incidence cantons was observed. The OHCA occurred more frequently at home, CPR and AED use by bystander were less frequent during the pandemic. Conversely, the OHCAs percentage in which a first responder was present, initiated the CPR and used an AED, increased. The outcome of patients in COVID-19 high-incidence cantons was worse compared to low-incidence cantons. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland mortality increased in Cantons with high-incidence of infection, whilst not in the low-incidence ones. OHCA occurrence followed an opposite trend showing how variables related to the health-system and EMS organization deeply influence OHCA occurrence during a pandemic.	Prevention
34198391	Social contacts, epidemic spreading and health system. Mathematical modeling and applications to COVID-19 infection. Lockdown and social distancing, as well as testing and contact tracing, are the main measures assumed by the governments to control and limit the spread of COVID-19 infection. In reason of that, special attention was recently paid by the scientific community to the mathematical modeling of infection spreading by including in classical models the effects of the distribution of contacts between individuals. Among other approaches, the coupling of the classical SIR model with a statistical study of the distribution of social contacts among the population, led some of the present authors to build a Social SIR model, able to accurately follow the effect of the decrease in contacts resulting from the lockdown measures adopted in various European countries in the first phase of the epidemic. The Social SIR has been recently tested and improved through a fruitful collaboration with the Health Protection Agency (ATS) of the province of Pavia (Italy), that made it possible to have at disposal all the relevant data relative to the spreading of COVID-19 infection in the province (half a million of people), starting from February 2020. The statistical analysis of the data was relevant to fit at best the parameters of the mathematical model, and to make short-term predictions of the spreading evolution in order to optimize the response of the local health system.

34220807	COVID-19 Severity in Obesity: Leptin and Inflammatory Cytokine Interplay in the Link Between High Morbidity and Mortality. Obesity is one of the foremost risk factors in coronavirus infection resulting in severe illness and mortality as the pandemic progresses. Obesity is a well-known predisposed chronic inflammatory condition. The dynamics of obesity and its impacts on immunity may change the disease severity of pneumonia, especially in acute respiratory distress syndrome, a primary cause of death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The adipocytes of adipose tissue secret leptin in proportion to individuals' body fat mass. An increase in circulating plasma leptin is a typical characteristic of obesity and correlates with a leptin-resistant state. Leptin is considered a pleiotropic molecule regulating appetite and immunity. In immunity, leptin functions as a cytokine and coordinates the host's innate and adaptive responses by promoting the Th1 type of immune response. Leptin induced the proliferation and functions of antigen-presenting cells, monocytes, and T helper cells, subsequently influencing the pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by these cells, such as TNF-alpha, IL-2, or IL-6. Leptin scarcity or resistance is linked with dysregulation of cytokine secretion leading to autoimmune disorders, inflammatory responses, and increased susceptibility towards infectious diseases. Therefore, leptin activity by leptin long-lasting super active antagonist's dysregulation in patients with obesity might contribute to high mortality rates in these patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review systematically discusses the interplay mechanism between leptin and inflammatory cytokines and their contribution to the fatal outcomes in COVID-19 patients with obesity.

34200168	Clinical Differences between COVID-19 and a COVID-Like Syndrome. COVID-19 is an infection due to SARS-CoV-2; this virus has been identified as the cause of the present pandemic. Several typical characteristics are present in this infection, in particular pneumonia with possible lung failure, but atypical clinical presentations are being described daily by physicians around the world. Ground-glass opacities with pneumonia are the most common and dangerous presentations of the COVID-19 disease, and they are usually associated with positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) tests with detectable SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Compared to the general population, hospital workers have been at a greater risk of infection ever since the first patients were hospitalized. However, hospital workers have also been reported as having COVID-like symptoms despite repeated negative swab tests but having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with serological tests. We can postulate that a COVID-like syndrome is possible, in particular in hospital workers, that is characterized by symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, but with repeated negative nasopharyngeal swabs. These repeated negative NSPs make the difference in daily clinical management with people that experienced a single false negative nasopharyngeal swab; furthermore, a clear clinical differentiation of these situations is still lacking in the literature. For this reason, here, we report our main findings from a cohort of patients with a COVID-like syndrome compared to a similar group affected by typical COVID-19.	Diagnosis
34228863	Adverse reactions to Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination of healthcare workers at Malta's state hospital. BACKGROUND: The long-term control of COVID-19 depends on an effective global vaccination strategy. Protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) from serious infection is critical. Malta, a European country, initiated the vaccination roll-out using Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine targeting HCWs. This study determined vaccination adverse effects (AEs) in this cohort. METHOD: An online survey was disseminated to all HCWs via work email (29/3/21 to 9/4/21) to gather AEs regarding pain, redness and swelling at injection site, fever, chills, fatigue, muscle/joint pains, headache, vomiting and diarrhoea severity following each dose (Likert scale). Descriptive, comparative and multiple binary regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: A response of 30.30% (n = 1480) was achieved with the commonest AEs being pain at injection site (88.92% CI 95%: 87.21-90.42), mostly mild (51%) and moderate (43%). Fatigue was reported by 72.97% (CI 95%: 70.65-75.17), 42% were mild and 41% were moderate. Females reported significantly (P </= .05, respectively) more pain (OR: 1.90), redness (OR: 2.49), swelling at injection site (OR: 1.33), fever (OR: 1.74), chills (OR: 2.32), fatigue (OR: 2.43), muscle (OR: 1.54) and joint pains (OR: 2.01), headache (OR: 2.07) and vomiting (OR: 3.43) when adjusted for age and HCW role. Localised AEs were reported following both vaccine doses unlike systemic AEs that were mostly reported after second doses. CONCLUSION: Vaccination benefits outweigh the minor AEs experienced, with females exhibiting a higher susceptibility. The general low vaccination AEs observed within the HCW cohort is encouraging and should help in allaying vaccine hesitancy among the population.	Treatment
34208037	To Trap a Pathogen: Neutrophil Extracellular Traps and Their Role in Mucosal Epithelial and Skin Diseases. Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating innate immune cells and comprise the first immune defense line, as they are the most rapidly recruited cells at sites of infection or inflammation. Their main microbicidal mechanisms are degranulation, phagocytosis, cytokine secretion and the formation of extracellular traps. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a microbicidal mechanism that involves neutrophil death. Since their discovery, in vitro and in vivo neutrophils have been challenged with a range of stimuli capable of inducing or inhibiting NET formation, with the objective to understand its function and regulation in health and disease. These networks composed of DNA and granular components are capable of immobilizing and killing pathogens. They comprise enzymes such as myeloperoxidase, elastase, cathepsin G, acid hydrolases and cationic peptides, all with antimicrobial and antifungal activity. Therefore, the excessive formation of NETs can also lead to tissue damage and promote local and systemic inflammation. Based on this concept, in this review, we focus on the role of NETs in different infectious and inflammatory diseases of the mucosal epithelia and skin.	Mechanism;Treatment
34290893	"Mucormycosis and COVID-19 an epidemic in a pandemic? Mucormycosis and aspergillosis are rare, invasive and life-threatening infections primarily caused by Rhizopus arrhizus and Aspergillus fumigatus with higher case fatality rates (>50%), respectively. Invasive Aspergillosis and Mucormycosis have been established and recognized as complications of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such cases have been intimately linked and related to prior corticosteroid therapy. With the new highly infectious Delta strain (B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1) of the coronavirus which is running rampant throughout India causing unprecedented death tolls, a new crisis is evolving. Invasive ""black fungus"" (Mucormycosis) is creating an epidemic within a global pandemic. The unique socio-economic, genetic and health status of Indian population culminates into a melting pot which sustains the viable triad for the ""black fungus"" infection to gain a stronghold. Diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression and the current COVID-19 global pandemic with its massive surges in the country have produced the ""perfect storm."" Ophthalmologist across India have reported a surge in invasive Mucormycosis cases with a rise in orbital compartment syndrome often calling for radical procedures such as enucleation surgeries. The ""black fungus"" pandemic and invasive Mucormycosis resulted in the sinister secondary infections and complications are closely linked with the COVID-19 infection in India. It is therefore of the upmost importance that neighbouring countries particularly Nepal and other Asiatic nations take great cognizance of this indolent ""black fungus killer"" and ensure new screening and testing protocols for early identification to ensure effective management."

34282808	Viral stimulation modulates endotype-related ACE2 expression in eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis. BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor targeted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is highly expressed in the nasal mucosa. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) shows diverse endotypes and is aggravated by viral infection. Whether viral stimulation and CRS endotype influence ACE2 expression remains unclear. We investigated the expression of ACE2 and the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which mediate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells, and assessed polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly[I:C])-induced changes based on CRS endotype. METHODOLOGY: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was evaluated based on CRS phenotype, endotype, and tissue type. Correlations between ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and inflammatory mediators in nasal polyps (NP) were examined. Air-liquid interface culture experiments were performed to assess the effects of major cytokines or poly(I:C) stimulation on ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression in primary epithelial cells from healthy nasal mucosa, eosinophilic NP (ENP), and non-eosinophilic NP (NENP). RESULTS: In primary nasal epithelial cells, interleukin (IL)-13 decreased ACE2 expression but increased TMPRSS2. Eosinophilic CRS showed lower ACE2 expression than non-eosinophilic CRS, regardless of CRS phenotype. CRS endotype was an independent factor associated with ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression in NP. Serum and tissue eosinophilic marker levels were inversely correlated with ACE2 expression, whereas tissue neutrophilic marker levels and ACE2 expression were positively correlated in NP. ACE2 expression was suppressed in ENP tissues; however, a combination of poly(I:C) and IL-13 induced ACE2/TMPRSS2 upregulation in ENP. CONCLUSIONS: ENP tissues have lower ACE2 expression than NENP; however, viral stimulation promotes ACE2/TMPRSS2 upregulation in ENP.	Mechanism;Treatment
34219357	Imbalance of von Willebrand factor and ADAMTS13 axis is rather a biomarker of strong inflammation and endothelial damage than a cause of thrombotic process in critically ill COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are prone to developing macrothrombosis and microthrombosis. COVID-19 has been reported to be rarely associated with thrombotic microangiopathies. A disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I repeats, member 13 (ADAMTS13) severe deficiency, the hallmark of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), induces the formation of platelet, unusually large von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimer microthrombi. In immune-mediated TTP, ADAMTS13 adopts specifically an open conformation. The VWF/ADAMTS13 couple may contribute to the microthrombi formation in pulmonary alveolar capillaries in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical features, hemostatic laboratory parameters, VWF/ADAMTS13 axis, and ADAMTS13 conformation in critically ill COVID-19 patients at admission. METHODS: Fifty three critically ill COVID-19 patients were enrolled between March 18 and May 9 2020 in a monocentric hospital. RESULTS: The median age was 59 years and the male-to-female ratio was 2.8/1. We reported seven pulmonary embolisms and 15 deaths. Biological investigations showed increased fibrinogen and factor V levels, and strongly increased D-dimers correlated with mortality. No patient presented severe thrombocytopenia nor microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. An imbalance between high VWF antigen levels and normal or slightly decreased ADAMTS13 activity levels (strongly elevated VWF/ADAMTS13 ratio) was correlated with mortality. Three patients had a partial quantitative deficiency in ADAMTS13. We also reported a closed conformation of ADAMTS13 in all patients, reinforcing the specificity of an open conformation of ADAMTS13 as a hallmark of TTP. CONCLUSION: We suggest that slightly decreased or normal ADAMTS13 activity and highly elevated VWF are rather biomarkers reflecting both the strong inflammation and the endothelial damage rather than drivers of the thrombotic process of COVID-19.

34222853	A colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after vaccination. Vaccination interventions is consideredan important preventive measure to block the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and protect the organism from pathogen infection effectively. However, a quick and accurate technique to evaluate the immune efficacy of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine remains scarce. In this paper, an IgM-IgG antibody combined detection colloidal gold immunochromatography assay kit was optimized and developed, which can assess the efficacy of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We collected fingertip blood samples from 3 vaccinees and 1 unvaccinated sample. The results showed that the proportion of antibody was high after the second shots immunization. The colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip is rapid, convenient and easy to operate. It can be used as an auxiliary method for preliminary evaluation of the antibody effect of vaccine recipients, and provide a reference index for the potential clinical application value of the vaccine.

34198770	COVID-19 in Dental Settings: Novel Risk Assessment Approach. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern, and this emergency led to postponing elective dental care procedures. The postponing aimed to protect the public from an unknown risk caused by COVID-19. At the beginning of the outbreak, for public health authorities, the aerosol-generating procedures and the close proximity between dental care workers and patients in dentistry represented sufficient justification for the delay of dental visits. Dental care is a priority, and for many years, studies have proven that the lack and delay of dental care can cause severe consequences for the oral health of the general population, which can cause a high global burden of oral diseases. Safety is necessary while resuming dental activities, and risk assessment is an efficient method for understanding and preventing the COVID-19 infectious threats facing the dental industry and affecting dental care workers and patients. In this study, for safe dental care delivery, we adapted risk assessment criteria and an approach and an occupational classification system. Based on those tools, we also recommend measures that can help to minimize infectious risk in dental settings.	Prevention

34220524	"He-Jie-Shen-Shi Decoction as an Adjuvant Therapy on Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Retrospective Cohort and Potential Mechanistic Study. Combination therapy using Western and traditional Chinese medicines has shown notable effects on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The He-Jie-Shen-Shi decoction (HJSS), composed of Bupleurum chinense DC., Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Makino, Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. ex DC., and nine other herbs, has been used to treat severe COVID-19 in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacies of HJSS combination therapy and Western monotherapy against severe COVID-19 and to study the potential action mechanism of HJSS. From February 2020 to March 2020, 81 patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan Tongji Hospital were selected for retrospective cohort study. Network pharmacology was conducted to predict the possible mechanism of HJSS on COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Targets of active components in HJSS were screened using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) and PharmMapper databases. The targets of COVID-19 and ARDS were obtained from GeneCards and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man databases. The key targets of HJSS in COVID-19 and ARDS were obtained based on the protein-protein interaction network (PPI). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis (KEGG) was conducted to predict the pathways related to the targets of HJSS in COVID-19 and ARDS. A ""herb-ingredient-target-pathway"" network was established using Cytoscape 3.2.7. Results showed that the duration of the negative conversion time of nucleic acid was shorter in patients who received HJSS combination therapy. HJSS combination therapy also relieved fever in patients with severe COVID-19. Network pharmacology analysis identified interleukin (IL) 6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), catalase (CAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1, tumor protein p53 (TP53), CC-chemokine ligand (CCL2), MAPK3, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and IL1B as the key targets of HJSS in COVID-19-related ARDS. KEGG analysis suggested that HJSS improved COVID-19-related ARDS by regulating hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, NOD-like receptor, TNF, T cell receptor, sphingolipid, PI3K-Akt, toll-like receptor, VEGF, FoxO, and MAPK signaling pathways. In conclusion, HJSS can be used as an adjuvant therapy on severe COVID-19. The therapeutic mechanisms may be involved in inhibiting viral replication, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress and alleviating lung injury. Further studies are required to confirm its clinical efficacies and action mechanisms."	Mechanism;Treatment
34362060	A Possible Role of Remdesivir and Plasma Therapy in the Selective Sweep and Emergence of New SARS-CoV-2 Variants. Since summer 2020, SARS-CoV-2 strains at the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic have suddenly been replaced by new SARS-CoV-2 variants, some of which are highly transmissible and spread at a high rate. These variants include the Marseille-4 lineage (Nextclade 20A.EU2) in Europe, the 20I/501Y.V1 variant first detected in the UK, the 20H/501Y.V2 variant first detected in South Africa, and the 20J/501Y.V3 variant first detected in Brazil. These variants are characterized by multiple mutations in the viral spike protein that is targeted by neutralizing antibodies elicited in response to infection or vaccine immunization. The usual coronavirus mutation rate through genetic drift alone cannot account for such rapid changes. Recent reports of the occurrence of such mutations in immunocompromised patients who received remdesivir and/or convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies to treat prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infections led us to hypothesize that experimental therapies that fail to cure the patients from COVID-19 could favor the emergence of immune escape SARS-CoV-2 variants. We review here the data that support this hypothesis and urge physicians and clinical trial promoters to systematically monitor viral mutations by whole-genome sequencing for patients who are administered these treatments.

34130944	COVID-19 and gastrointestinal system: A brief review. COVID-19 is a recent pandemic that is still a major health problem of modern times and already more than 17.5 lakhs people succumbed to this deadly disease. This disease is caused by novel coronavirus which is named SARS-COV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. This virus originated from Wuhan city in Hubei province of China in December 2019 and within a short period spread across the many countries in the globe. There are a lot of basic as well as clinical research is going on to study the mode of transmission and the mechanism of action of SARS-COV-2 infection and its therapeutics. SARS-COV-2 is not only known to infect lungs, but it also infects other organs in the human body including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the liver, and the pancreas via the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, an important component of the renin-angiotensin system. In this short review, we are mainly discussing the mode of SARS-COV-2 transmission, physiological counterbalancing roles of ACE2 and ACE and the tissue patterns of ACE2 expression, and the overall effect of COVID19 on human gastrointestinal System. Therefore, this review sheds light on the possible mechanism of SARS-COV-2 infection in the GI system and its pathological symptoms raising a potential possibility of GI tract acting as a secondary site for SARS-CoV-2 tropism and infection. Finally, future studies to understand the fecal-oral transmission of the virus and the correlation of viral load and severity of GI symptoms are proposed to gain knowledge of the GI symptoms in COVID-19 to aid in early diagnosis and prognosis.

34334737	Race, Ethnicity, Neighborhood Characteristics, and In-Hospital Coronavirus Disease-2019 Mortality. BACKGROUND: Despite many studies reporting disparities in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) incidence and outcomes in Black and Hispanic/Latino populations, mechanisms are not fully understood to inform mitigation strategies. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test whether neighborhood factors beyond individual patient-level factors are associated with in-hospital mortality from COVID-19. We hypothesized that the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a neighborhood census-block-level composite measure, was associated with COVID-19 mortality independently of race, ethnicity, and other patient factors. RESEARCH DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study examining COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. SUBJECTS: Inclusion required hospitalization with positive SARS-CoV-2 test or COVID-19 diagnosis at three large Midwestern academic centers. MEASURES: The primary study outcome was COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. Patient-level predictors included age, sex, race, insurance, body mass index, comorbidities, and ventilation. Neighborhoods were examined through the national ADI neighborhood deprivation rank comparing in-hospital mortality across ADI quintiles. Analyses used multivariable logistic regression with fixed site effects. RESULTS: Among 5999 COVID-19 patients median age was 61 (interquartile range: 44-73), 48% were male, 30% Black, and 10.8% died. Among patients who died, 32% lived in the most disadvantaged quintile while 11% lived in the least disadvantaged quintile; 52% of Black, 24% of Hispanic/Latino, and 8.5% of White patients lived in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods.Living in the most disadvantaged neighborhood quintile predicted higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.13-2.67) independent of race. Age, male sex, Medicare coverage, and ventilation also predicted mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood disadvantage independently predicted in-hospital COVID-19 mortality. Findings support calls to consider neighborhood measures for vaccine distribution and policies to mitigate disparities.	Treatment;Diagnosis
34289876	Paradoxical low severity of COVID-19 in Prader-Willi syndrome: data from a French survey on 647 patients. BACKGROUND: Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) often have comorbidities, especially obesity, that may constitute a risk factor for severe forms of COVID-19. We aimed to assess prevalence and medical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adults with PWS. From November 2020 to January 2021, we performed a detailed medical survey on 342 adults and 305 children with PWS followed in the French reference center. RESULTS: We obtained responses from 288 adults (84%) and 239 children (78%). From March 2020 to January 2021, 38 adults (13.2%) and 13 children (5.4%) with PWS had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mean age of adults was 34.1 +/- 11.9 years and mean body mass index was 40.6 +/- 12.7 kg/m(2); 82% had obesity and 37% had diabetes. Only 3 children (23%) had obesity and none had diabetes. Similar to the general population, the most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 were asthenia, fever, cough, headache and shortness of breath. All patients had a favorable outcome. CONCLUSION: PWS itself is not a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in children and adults. On the contrary, evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults with PWS seems more favorable than expected, given their comorbidities.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34290032	Temporal association between SARS-CoV-2 and new-onset myasthenia gravis: is it causal or coincidental? Several case reports of COVID-19 in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) have been documented. However, new-onset autoimmune MG following COVID-19 has been reported very rarely. We report one such case here. A 65-year-old man presented to us with dysphagia 6 weeks following mild COVID-19. He was evaluated and diagnosed as antiacetylcholine receptor antibody (AchR) positive, non-thymomatous, generalised MG. He subsequently developed myasthenic crisis and improved after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, prednisolone and pyridostigmine. Systematic literature review showed eight more similar cases. Analysis of all cases including the one reported here showed these features: mean age 55.8 years, male gender (5), time interval between COVID-19 and MG (5-56 days), generalised (5), bulbar and/or ocular symptoms (4), anti-AchR antibodies (7) and antimuscle-specific kinase antibodies (2). All have improved with immunotherapy. Although, many hypothesis are proposed to explain causal relationship between the two, it could as well be sheer coincidence.	Case Report
34344331	COVID-19 inpatients with gastrointestinal onset: sex and care needs' differences in the district of Ferrara, Italy. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, but a presentation of the disease with digestive symptoms only may occur. This work was aimed at evaluating: (1) the prevalence of presentation with digestive symptoms only in our cohort of COVID-19 inpatients; (2) differences between patients with and without gastrointestinal onset; (3) differences among males and females with gastrointestinal presentation; (4) outcomes of the groups of subjects with and without gastrointestinal onset. METHOD: We retrospectively divided the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 into two groups: (1) the one with digestive symptoms (DSG) and (2) the other without digestive symptoms (NDSG). We compared the subjects of DSG with those of NDSG and males with females in the DSG group only, in terms of demographics (age, sex), inflammation and organ damage indexes, length of stay, in-hospital and 100-day mortality. RESULTS: The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms at presentation was 12.5%. The DSG group showed a prevalence of females, and these tended to a shorter hospital stay; DSG patients were younger and with a higher load of comorbidities, but no differences concerning inflammation and organ damage indexes, need for intensification of care, in-hospital and 100-day mortality were detected. Among DSG patients, males were younger than females, more comorbid, with higher serum CRP and showed a longer length of hospital stay. Survival functions of DSG patients, in general, are more favourable than those of NDSG if adjusted for sex, age and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The prevalence of gastrointestinal presentation among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 12.5%; (2) DSG patients were on average younger, more comorbid and with a prevalence of females, with a shorter hospital stay; (3) in the DSG group, males had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Score and needed a longer hospital stay; (4) DSG subjects seem to survive longer than those of the NDSG group.

34133128	Epitope-Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles for Rapid and Selective Detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibodies. Rapid and inexpensive immunodiagnostic assays to monitor severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroconversion are essential for conducting large-scale COVID-19 epidemiological surveillance and profiling humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 infections or immunizations. Herein, a colorimetic serological assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgGs in patients' plasma was developed using short antigenic epitopes conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Four immunodominant linear B-cell epitopes, located on the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2, were characterized for their IgG binding affinity and used as highly specific biological motifs on the nanoparticle to recognize target antibodies. Specific bivalent binding between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and epitope-functionalized AuNPs trigger nanoparticle aggregation, which manifests as a distinct optical transition in the AuNPs' plasmon characteristics within 30 min of antibody introduction. Co-immobilization of two epitopes improved the assay sensitivity relative to single-epitope AuNPs with a limit of detection of 3.2 nM, commensurate with IgG levels in convalescent COVID-19-infected patients. A passivation strategy was further pursued to preserve the sensing response in human plasma medium. When tested against 35 clinical plasma samples of varying illness severity, the optimized nanosensor assay can successfully identify SARS-CoV-2 infection with 100% specificity and 83% sensitivity. As the epitopes are conserved within the circulating COVID-19 variants, the proposed platform holds great potential to serve as a cost-effective and highly specific alternative to classical immunoassays employing recombinant viral proteins. These epitope-enabled nanosensors further expand the serodiagnostic toolbox for COVID-19 epidemiological study, humoral response monitoring, or vaccine efficiency assessment.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34203612	Methods of Respiratory Virus Detection: Advances towards Point-of-Care for Early Intervention. Respiratory viral infections threaten human life and inflict an enormous healthcare burden worldwide. Frequent monitoring of viral antibodies and viral load can effectively help to control the spread of the virus and make timely interventions. However, current methods for detecting viral load require dedicated personnel and are time-consuming. Additionally, COVID-19 detection is generally relied on an automated PCR analyzer, which is highly instrument-dependent and expensive. As such, emerging technologies in the development of respiratory viral load assays for point-of-care (POC) testing are urgently needed for viral screening. Recent advances in loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), biosensors, nanotechnology-based paper strips and microfluidics offer new strategies to develop a rapid, low-cost, and user-friendly respiratory viral monitoring platform. In this review, we summarized the traditional methods in respiratory virus detection and present the state-of-art technologies in the monitoring of respiratory virus at POC.	Diagnosis
34333039	Patient Satisfaction with Telephone Versus Video- Televisits: A Cross-Sectional Survey of an Urban, Multiethnic Population. OBJECTIVE: To examine differences between telephone- and video-televisits and identify whether visit modality is associated with satisfaction in an urban, academic general urology practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of patients who completed a televisit at our urology practice (summer 2020) was performed. A Likert-based satisfaction telephone survey was offered to patients within 7 days of their televisit. Patient demographics, televisit modality (telephone vs video), and outcomes of the visit (e.g. follow-up visit scheduled, orders placed) were retrospectively abstracted from each chart and compared between the telephone and video cohorts. Multivariate regression analysis was used to evaluate variables associated with satisfaction while controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: 269 patients were analyzed. 73% (196/269) completed a telephone televisit. Compared to the video cohort, the telephone cohort was slightly older (mean 58.8 years vs. 54.2 years, p=0.03). There were no significant differences in the frequency of orders placed for medication changes, labs, imaging, or for in-person follow-up visits within 30-days between cohorts. Survey results showed overall 84.7% patients were satisfied, and there was no significant difference between the telephone and video cohorts. Visit type was not associated with satisfaction on multivariable analyses, while use of an interpreter [OR:8.13 (1.00-65.94); p=0.05], labs ordered [OR:2.74 (1.12-6.70); p=0.03] and female patient gender [OR:2.28 (1.03-5.03); p=0.04] were significantly associated with satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, most patients were satisfied with their televisit. Additionally, telephone- and video-televisits were similar regarding patient opinions, patient characteristics, and visit outcome. Efforts to increase access and coverage of telehealth, particularly telephone-televisits, should continue past the COVID-19 pandemic.	Prevention
34222055	Association between cardiometabolic risk factors and COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and mortality: a review. The novel coronavirus, which began spreading from China Wuhan and gradually spreaded to most countries, led to the announcement by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, as a new pandemic. The most important point presented by the World Health Organization about this disease is to better understand the risk factors that exacerbate the course of the disease and worsen its prognosis. Due to the high majority of cardio metabolic risk factors like obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia among the population over 60 years old and higher, these cardio metabolic risk factors along with the age of these people could worsen the prognosis of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and its mortality. In this study, we aimed to review the articles from the beginning of the pandemic on the impression of cardio metabolic risk factors on COVID-19 and the effectiveness of COVID-19 on how to manage these diseases. All the factors studied in this article, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and obesity exacerbate the course of Covid-19 disease by different mechanisms, and the inflammatory process caused by coronavirus can also create a vicious cycle in controlling these diseases for patients.

34207205	The COVID-19 Pandemic Situation in Malaysia: Lessons Learned from the Perspective of Population Density. This paper attempts to ascertain the impacts of population density on the spread and severity of COVID-19 in Malaysia. Besides describing the spatio-temporal contagion risk of the virus, ultimately, it seeks to test the hypothesis that higher population density results in exacerbated COVID-19 virulence in the community. The population density of 143 districts in Malaysia, as per data from Malaysia's 2010 population census, was plotted against cumulative COVID-19 cases and infection rates of COVID-19 cases, which were obtained from Malaysia's Ministry of Health official website. The data of these three variables were collected between 19 January 2020 and 31 December 2020. Based on the observations, districts that have high population densities and are highly inter-connected with neighbouring districts, whether geographically, socio-economically, or infrastructurally, tend to experience spikes in COVID-19 cases within weeks of each other. Using a parametric approach of the Pearson correlation, population density was found to have a moderately strong relationship to cumulative COVID-19 cases (p-value of 0.000 and R(2) of 0.415) and a weak relationship to COVID-19 infection rates (p-value of 0.005 and R(2) of 0.047). Consequently, we provide several non-pharmaceutical lessons, including urban planning strategies, as passive containment measures that may better support disease interventions against future contagious diseases.

34345765	Maternity care during COVID-19: a protocol for a qualitative evidence synthesis of women's and maternity care providers' views and experiences. Background: Considerable changes in maternity care provision internationally were implemented in response to COVID-19. Such changes, often occurring suddenly with little advance warning, have had the potential to affect women's and maternity care providers experience of maternity care, both positively and negatively. For this reason, to gain insight and understanding of personal and professional experiences, we will perform a synthesis of the available qualitative evidence on women and maternity care providers' views and experiences of maternity care during COVID-19. Methods and analysis: A qualitative evidence synthesis will be conducted. Studies will be eligible if they include pregnant or postpartum women (up to six months) and maternity care providers who received or provided care during COVID-19. To retrieve relevant literature the electronic databases of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane COVID study register ( https://covid-19.cochrane.org/) will be searched from 01-Jan-2020 to date of search. A combination of search terms based on COVID-19, pregnancy, childbirth and maternity care, and study design, will be used to guide the search. The methodological quality of the included studies will be assessed by at least two reviewers using the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (EPPI)-Centre 12-criteria quality assessment tool. The Thomas and Harden approach to thematic synthesis will be used for data synthesis. This will involve line by line coding of extracted data, establishing descriptive themes, and determining analytical themes. Confidence in the findings of the review will be assessed by two reviewers independently using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (GRADE-CERQual). Conclusion: The proposed synthesis of evidence will help identify maternity care needs during a global pandemic from the perspectives of those receiving and providing care. The evidence will inform and help enhance care provision into the future.	Prevention
34367645	SARS-CoV-2 Reinfection in Patients Negative for Immunoglobulin G Following Recovery from COVID-19. While many patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) eventually produce neutralising antibodies, the degree of susceptibility of previously infected individuals to reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown. To better understand the impact of the immunoglobulin (IgG) level on reinfection in recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 were measured in 829 patients with previously confirmed infection just after their recovery. Notably, 87 of these patients had no detectable IgG concentration. While there was just one case of asymptomatic reinfection 4.5 months after the initial recovery amongst patients with detectable anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels, 25 of the 87 patients negative for anti-nucleocapsid IgG were reinfected within one to three months after their first infection. Therefore, patients who recover from COVID-19 with no detectable anti-nucleocapsid IgG concentration appear to remain more susceptible to reinfection by SARS-CoV-2, with no apparent immunity. Also, although our results suggest the chance is lower, the possibility for recovered patients with positive anti-nucleocapsid IgG findings to be reinfected similarly exists.	Diagnosis
34377631	Herbal plants as immunity modulators against COVID-19: A primary preventive measure during home quarantine. The novel coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a deadly virus which has spread globally and claimed millions of lives. This novel virus transmits mainly through droplets and close human contact. It's impact in different countries varies depending on geographical location, climatic conditions, food habits, and cultural activities. Several precautionary measures, as well as many medicines, are applied in different combinations to limit the spread of infection. This results in a preliminary relief of people infected in the first stage of infection. An alternative approach has been introduced which proposes natural herbs, which have minimal or no side effects, and improve overall immunity. Some essential herbs with their immunomodulatory effects are mentioned in this article along with suggestions for improved immunity and protection.	Prevention
34204614	Acceptability of Healthcare Professionals to Get Vaccinated against COVID-19 Two Weeks before Initiation of National Vaccination. Background and Objectives The greatest challenge vaccines face is that of acceptance from the general population. Healthcare professionals' (HCPs) recommendations have significant influence on general public vaccination behavior. The aim of this study was to assess the willingness of HCPs to get vaccinated against COVID-19, two weeks before initiation of vaccinations. Materials and Methods: We conducted an anonymous online survey from 11-15 December 2020 among HCPs by emails delivered from the local medical and nursing stuff associations. Results: The 71.1% of 656 HCPs intended to accept vaccination, 5.9% did not and 23% were still undecided. The acceptance rate was higher in physicians (76.5%) and significantly lower in nurses (48.3%). Most of the responders who intended to accept vaccination were males (p = 0.01), physicians (p = 0.001), older (p = 0.02), married (p = 0.054) with children (p = 0.001), and had treated patients with COVID-19 (p < 0.001). In the multivariate logistic regression, the predictors of HCPs willingness to get vaccinated were parenthood (OR = 4.19, p = 0.003), being a physician (OR = 2.79, p = 0.04), and treating confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients (OR = 2.87, p = 0.036). Conclusions: Low vaccination acceptance rate was found especially in nurses, and as this may have a negative impact in the vaccination compliance of the general public, interventional educational programs to enhance vaccination are crucial.

34284323	COVID-19 Lockdown Effects on Acute Stroke Care in Latin America. OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 pandemic has forced important changes in health care worldwide. Stroke care networks have been affected, especially during peak periods. We assessed the impact of the pandemic and lockdowns in stroke admissions and care in Latin America. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multinational study (7 countries, 18 centers) of patients admitted during the pandemic outbreak (March-June 2020). Comparisons were made with the same period in 2019. Numbers of cases, stroke etiology and severity, acute care and hospitalization outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Most countries reported mild decreases in stroke admissions compared to the same period of 2019 (1187 vs. 1166, p = 0.03). Among stroke subtypes, there was a reduction in ischemic strokes (IS) admissions (78.3% vs. 73.9%, p = 0.01) compared with 2019, especially in IS with NIHSS 0-5 (50.1% vs. 44.9%, p = 0.03). A substantial increase in the proportion of stroke admissions beyond 48 h from symptoms onset was observed (13.8% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.001). Nevertheless, no differences in total reperfusion treatment rates were observed, with similar door-to-needle, door-to-CT, and door-to-groin times in both periods. Other stroke outcomes, as all-type mortality during hospitalization (4.9% vs. 9.7%, p < 0.001), length of stay (IQR 1-5 days vs. 0-9 days, p < 0.001), and likelihood to be discharged home (91.6% vs. 83.0%, p < 0.001), were compromised during COVID-19 lockdown period. CONCLUSIONS: In this Latin America survey, there was a mild decrease in admissions of IS during the COVID-19 lockdown period, with a significant delay in time to consultations and worse hospitalization outcomes.

34284815	Characteristics and outcomes of family-practice patients with coronavirus disease 2019: a case series. BACKGROUND: The clinical history and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 among people not hospitalized is not yet well characterized. To better inform clinical evaluation, we set out to characterize the natural history of coronavirus disease 2019 in primary health care. METHODS: Case series of all patients rostered to physicians at a university-affiliated Family Medicine clinic. Cases met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of coronavirus disease 2019 from March 1 to May 21 2020. RESULTS: In total, 89 patients meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for coronavirus disease 2019 were documented. Their average age was 55.6 years (range 6-95 years), and all but one was symptomatic. Fifty-seven cases (64%) had a polymerase chain reaction test for coronavirus disease 2019, of whom 77.2% tested positive. Thirty cases (33.7%) reported contact with a confirmed or probable case of coronavirus disease 2019. Based on the Charlson Comorbidity Index, 28 cases (31.5%) had no comorbid conditions. The median number of days from symptom onset to first polymerase chain reaction test was 6 days (interquartile range 2.3-11 days). The median duration of fever was 3.5 days (interquartile range 1-7 days). Twenty-four cases (27%) visited the Emergency Department, and 10 were admitted to hospital. The median number of days between symptom onset and first Emergency Department visit was 8 days (interquartile range 3.5-27 days). CONCLUSIONS: At the start of this pandemic, the implementation of basic measures such as diagnostic testing was delayed. If we are to improve our control over the spread of coronavirus disease 2019, we will need to substantially reduce the time from symptom onset to diagnostic testing, and subsequent contact tracing. To minimize unnecessary Emergency Department visits, we propose a testable strategy for Family Medicine to engage with coronavirus disease 2019 patients in the acute phase of their illness.

34283842	Heterogeneity matters: Contact structure and individual variation shape epidemic dynamics. In the recent COVID-19 pandemic, mathematical modeling constitutes an important tool to evaluate the prospective effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and to guide policy-making. Most research is, however, centered around characterizing the epidemic based on point estimates like the average infectiousness or the average number of contacts. In this work, we use stochastic simulations to investigate the consequences of a population's heterogeneity regarding connectivity and individual viral load levels. Therefore, we translate a COVID-19 ODE model to a stochastic multi-agent system. We use contact networks to model complex interaction structures and a probabilistic infection rate to model individual viral load variation. We observe a large dependency of the dispersion and dynamical evolution on the population's heterogeneity that is not adequately captured by point estimates, for instance, used in ODE models. In particular, models that assume the same clinical and transmission parameters may lead to different conclusions, depending on different types of heterogeneity in the population. For instance, the existence of hubs in the contact network leads to an initial increase of dispersion and the effective reproduction number, but to a lower herd immunity threshold (HIT) compared to homogeneous populations or a population where the heterogeneity stems solely from individual infectivity variations.

34291377	COVID-19 in the California State Prison System: an Observational Study of Decarceration, Ongoing Risks, and Risk Factors. BACKGROUND: Correctional institutions nationwide are seeking to mitigate COVID-19-related risks. OBJECTIVE: To quantify changes to California's prison population since the pandemic began and identify risk factors for COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: For California state prisons (March 1-October 10, 2020), we described residents' demographic characteristics, health status, COVID-19 risk scores, room occupancy, and labor participation. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the association between rates of COVID-19 infection and room occupancy and out-of-room labor, respectively. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of California state prisons. MAIN MEASURES: Changes in the incarcerated population's size, composition, housing, and activities. For the risk factor analysis, the exposure variables were room type (cells vs. dormitories) and labor participation (any room occupant participating in the prior 2 weeks) and the outcome variable was incident COVID-19 case rates. KEY RESULTS: The incarcerated population decreased 19.1% (119,401 to 96,623) during the study period. On October 10, 2020, 11.5% of residents were aged >/=60, 18.3% had high COVID-19 risk scores, 31.0% participated in out-of-room labor, and 14.8% lived in rooms with >/=10 occupants. Nearly 40% of residents with high COVID-19 risk scores lived in dormitories. In 9 prisons with major outbreaks (6,928 rooms; 21,750 residents), dormitory residents had higher infection rates than cell residents (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.51 95% CI, 2.25-2.80) and residents of rooms with labor participation had higher rates than residents of other rooms (AHR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.39-1.74). CONCLUSION: Despite reductions in room occupancy and mixing, California prisons still house many medically vulnerable residents in risky settings. Reducing risks further requires a combination of strategies, including rehousing, decarceration, and vaccination.	Prevention
34345766	Retinal vascular findings in patients with COVID-19. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the retinal vascular caliber of COVID-19 patients with that of healthy subjects. Methods: This was a prospective case-control study. Forty-six patients who had COVID-19 were successfully treated, and 38 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Fundus photography was taken using fundus fluorescein angiography (FA; Visucam 500; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany). Retinal vascular caliber was analyzed with IVAN, a semi-automated retinal vascular analyzer (Nicole J. Ferrier, College of Engineering, Fundus Photography Reading Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA). Central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE), central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE), and artery-vein ratio (AVR) were compared between groups. Results: The mean age was 37.8 +/- 9.5 years in the COVID-19 group (n = 46) and 40 +/- 8 years in the control group (n = 38) (p = 0.45). The mean CRAE was 181.56 +/- 6.40 in the COVID-19 group and 171.29 +/- 15.06 in the control group (p = 0.006). The mean CRVE was 226.34 +/- 23.83 in the COVID-19 group and 210.94 +/- 22.22 in the control group (p = 0.044). AVR was 0.81 +/- 0.09 in the COVID-19 group and 0.82 +/- 0.13 in the control group (p = 0.712). Conclusion: Patients who had COVID-19 have vasodilation in the retinal vascular structure after recovery. As they may be at risk of retinal vascular disease, COVID-19 patients must be followed after recovery.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34350146	Perspective of Immunopathogenesis and Immunotherapies for Kawasaki Disease. Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an acute inflammatory illness that mostly occurs in children below 5 years of age, with intractable fever, mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, and lesions of the coronary artery (CAL). KD is sharing clinical symptoms with systemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) which is related to COVID-19. Certain genes are identified to be associated with KD, but the findings usually differ between countries and races. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele types and toll-like receptor (TLR) expression are also correlated to KD. The acute hyperinflammation in KD is mediated by an imbalance between augmented T helper 17 (Th17)/Th1 responses with high levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-gamma, and IP-10, in contrast to reduced Th2/Treg responses with lower IL-4, IL-5, FoxP3, and TGF-beta expression. KD has varying phenotypic variations regarding age, gender, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance, macrophage activation and shock syndrome. The signs of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) can be interpreted as hyperferritinemia and thrombocytopenia contradictory to thrombocytosis in typical KD; the signs of KD with shock syndrome (KDSS) can be interpreted as overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) and coagulopathy. For over five decades, IVIG and aspirin are the standard treatment for KD. However, some KD patients are refractory to IVIG required additional medications against inflammation. Further studies are proposed to delineate the immunopathogenesis of IVIG-resistance and KDSS, to identify high risk patients with genetic susceptibility, and to develop an ideal treatment regimen, such as by providing idiotypic immunoglobulins to curb cytokine storms, NO overproduction, and the epigenetic induction of Treg function.

34221849	Epidemiological modelling of the health and economic effects of COVID-19 control in Australia's second wave. Background: We investigated the public health and economy outcomes of different levels of social distancing to control a 'second wave' outbreak in Australia and identify implications for public health management of COVID-19. Methods: Individual-based and compartment models were used to simulate the effects of different social distancing and detection strategies on Australian COVID-19 infections and the economy from March to July 2020. These models were used to evaluate the effects of different social distancing levels and the early relaxation of suppression measures, in terms of public health and economy outcomes. Results: The models, fitted to observations up to July 2020, yielded projections consistent with subsequent cases and showed that better public health outcomes and lower economy costs occur when social distancing measures are more stringent, implemented earlier and implemented for a sufficiently long duration. Early relaxation of suppression results in worse public health outcomes and higher economy costs. Conclusions: Better public health outcomes (reduced COVID-19 fatalities) are positively associated with lower economy costs and higher levels of social distancing; achieving zero community transmission lowers both public health and economy costs compared to allowing community transmission to continue; and early relaxation of social distancing increases both public health and economy costs.

34217424	Prioritizing breast imaging services during the COVID pandemic: A survey of breast imaging facilities within the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted breast cancer screening and diagnostic imaging in the United States. We sought to evaluate how medical facilities prioritized breast imaging services during periods of reduced capacity or upon re-opening after closures. In fall 2020, we surveyed 77 breast imaging facilities within the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium in the United States. The survey ascertained the pandemic's impact on clinical practices during March-September 2020. Nearly all facilities (97%) reported closing or operating at reduced capacity at some point during this period. All facilities were open by August 2020, though 14% were still operating at reduced capacity in September 2020. During periods of re-opening or reduced capacity, 93% of facilities reported prioritizing diagnostic breast imaging over breast cancer screening. For diagnostic imaging, facilities prioritized based on rescheduling canceled appointments (89%), specific indication for diagnostic imaging (89%), patient demand (84%), individual characteristics and risk factors (77%), and time since last imaging examination (72%). For screening mammography, facilities prioritized based on rescheduled cancelations (96%), patient demand (83%), individual characteristics and risk factors (73%), and time since last mammogram (71%). For biopsy services, more than 90% of facilities reported prioritization based on rescheduling of canceled exams, patient demand, patient characteristics and risk factors and level of suspicion on imaging. The observed patterns from this large and geographically diverse sample of facilities in the United States indicate that multiple factors were commonly used to prioritize breast imaging services during periods of reduced capacity.

34335985	A deep learning framework using CNN and stacked Bi-GRU for COVID-19 predictions in India. The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 declared as a global pandemic by the WHO was the most rapidly spreading disease all across the world. India, the second most populated nation in the world, is still fighting it, when coronavirus reached the stage where community transmission takes place at an exponential rate. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the future trends of COVID-19 in India and anticipate how it will affect economic and social growth in a short run. In this paper, a new deep learning framework using CNN and stacked Bi-GRU has been developed for predicting and analyzing the COVID-19 cases in India. The proposed model can predict the next 30 days' new positive cases, new death cases, recovery rate and containment and health index values with high accuracy. The proposed method is compared against Gaussian process regression (GPR) model on COVID-19 datasets. The experimental result shows that the proposed framework is highly reliable for COVID-19 prediction over the GPR model.	Epidemic Forecasting
34207404	An Examination of COVID-19 Mitigation Efficiency among 23 Countries. The purpose of this paper was to compare the relative efficiency of COVID-19 transmission mitigation among 23 selected countries, including 19 countries in the G20, two heavily infected countries (Iran and Spain), and two highly populous countries (Pakistan and Nigeria). The mitigation efficiency for each country was evaluated at each stage by using data envelopment analysis (DEA) tools and changes in mitigation efficiency were analyzed across stages. Pearson correlation tests were conducted between each change to examine the impact of efficiency ranks in the previous stage on subsequent stages. An indicator was developed to judge epidemic stability and was applied to practical cases involving lifting travel restrictions and restarting the economy in some countries. The results showed that Korea and Australia performed with the highest efficiency in preventing the diffusion of COVID-19 for the whole period covering 105 days since the first confirmed case, while the USA ranked at the bottom. China, Japan, Korea, and Australia were judged to have recovered from the attack of COVID-19 due to higher epidemic stability.	Prevention
34225540	Molecular detections of coronavirus: current and emerging methodologies. Introduction: Seven coronavirus species have been identified that can infect humans. While human coronavirus infections had been historically associated with only mild respiratory symptoms similar to the common cold, three coronaviruses identified since 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2, cause life-threatening severe respiratory syndromes. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a worldwide health emergency. Due to the lack of effective drugs and vaccination, rapid and reliable detection is of vital importance to control coronavirus epidemics/pandemics.Area covered: A literature search was performed in Pubmed covering the detections and diagnostics of SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. This review summarized the current knowledge of established and emerging methods for coronavirus detection. The characteristics of different diagnostic approaches were described, and the strengths and weaknesses of each method were analyzed and compared. In addition, future trends in the field of coronavirus detection were also discussed.Expert opinion: Nucleic acid-based RT-PCR is the current golden-standard of coronavirus detection, while immunoassays provide history of coronavirus infection besides diagnostic information. Integrated high-throughput system holds the great potential and is the trend of future detection and diagnosis of virus infection.	Diagnosis
34216513	Performing nasopharyngeal swabs-Guidelines based on an anatomical study. Nasopharyngeal swabs are performed to collect material for diagnosing diseases affecting the respiratory system, such as Covid-19. Yet, no systematic anatomical study defines concrete prerequisites for successfully targeting the nasopharyngeal mucosa. We therefore aim at simulating nasopharyngeal swabs in human body donors to characterize parameters allowing and supporting to enter the nasopharynx with a swab, while avoiding endangering the cribriform plate. With the aid of metal probes and commercial swabs a total of 314 nasopharyngeal swabs in anatomical head/neck specimens stemming from 157 body donors were simulated. Important anatomical parameters were photo-documented and measured. We provide information on angles and distances between prominent anatomical landmarks and particularly important positions the probe occupies during its advancement through the nares to the upper and lower parts of the nasopharynx and cribriform plate. Based on these data we suggest a simple and safe three-step procedure for conducting nasopharyngeal swabs. In addition, we define easily recognizable signals for its correct performance. Evaluations prove that this procedure in all specimens without deformations of the nasal cavity allows the swab to enter the nasopharynx, whereas a widespread used alternative only succeeds in less than 50%. Our data will be the key for the successful collection of nasopharyngeal material for detecting and characterizing pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, which have a high affinity to pharyngeal mucosa. They demonstrate that the danger for damaging the cribriform plate or olfactory mucosa with swabs is unlikely, but potentially higher when performing nasal swabs.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34285502	COVID-19 Prevention Practices and Associated Factors Among Farmers in Peri-Urban Areas of Northeastern Ethiopia. Background: COVID-19 is a global health threat due to its rapid spread and ability to kill millions of people. The majority of pandemic-fighting approaches rely on prevention activities, which can be influenced by a variety of factors. Farmers are more vulnerable to COVID-19, so evaluating existing prevention practices and associated factors is critical to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To assess COVID-19 prevention practices and associated factors among farmers in peri-urban areas of Northeastern Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 409 selected farmers. Data were collected using face-to-face interviews and on-the-spot-observational checklist. Data were analyzed using bivariable logistic regression model at 95% CI (confidence interval). During the bivariable analysis (crude odds ratio [COR]), varibales having a p-value of less than 0.250 were included into the multivariable analysis (adjsuted odds ratio [AOR]). Factors associated with COVID-19 preventive practices were determined using a multivariable analysis at a p-value of 0.050. Results: Of 409 participants, 206 (63.6%), 157 (38.4%), and 117 (28.6%) of them had satisfactory knowledge, positive attitude, and good prevention practices about COVID-19, respectively. Age of the farmers with greater than or equal to 45 years (AOR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.7-6.1), educational status of secondary school and above (AOR: 3.1; 95% CI: 1.4-6.6), and income level of having greater than or equal to 2,001.00 Ethiopian birr (ETB) (AOR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1-3.4) were all found to be significantly associated with the COVID-19 prevention practices. Conclusion: Even though the majority of farmers had satisfactory knowledge, a considerable proportion of them had a negative attitude and poor COVID-19 prevention practices. Age, educational status, and income level are factors associated with COVID-19 prevention practices. Hence, health education should be given to improve the farmers' knowledge, attitudes and prevention practices to minimize the risk of COVID-19 among farmers in semi-urban areas of northestern Ethiopia.

34202529	Retracted: The Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations-We Should Rethink the Policy. Background: COVID-19 vaccines have had expedited reviews without sufficient safety data. We wanted to compare risks and benefits. Method: We calculated the number needed to vaccinate (NNTV) from a large Israeli field study to prevent one death. We accessed the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) database of the European Medicines Agency and of the Dutch National Register (lareb.nl) to extract the number of cases reporting severe side effects and the number of cases with fatal side effects. Result: The NNTV is between 200-700 to prevent one case of COVID-19 for the mRNA vaccine marketed by Pfizer, while the NNTV to prevent one death is between 9000 and 50,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate. The number of cases experiencing adverse reactions has been reported to be 700 per 100,000 vaccinations. Currently, we see 16 serious side effects per 100,000 vaccinations, and the number of fatal side effects is at 4.11/100,000 vaccinations. For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination. Conclusions: This lack of clear benefit should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy.

34220992	Equity and the Cuban National Health System's response to COVID-19. Cuba's National Health System has managed to guarantee an effective and equitable response to COVID-19. Universal and free health coverage, based on primary care, follows the principle of equity and the greatest resources are allocated to areas of the lowest socioeconomic stratum (where higher risk is concentrated), followed by those of medium and high strata, in that order. This allowed for similar mortality rates in the three strata, and Cuban national mortality rate was one of the lowest in the Region of the Americas. Before the first case was identified in Cuba, a Plan for Coronavirus Prevention and Control was elaborated with multisectoral participation, and when the first case was confirmed the Temporary National Working Group to Fight COVID-19 was created as an advisory body of the government. The actions to face the pandemic began with preventive measures in the community, continued in the isolation centers and ended again in the community with actions of surveillance and follow up of recovered patients. Following the principle of territoriality, molecular diagnosis laboratories were created in the provinces that did not have one. Free medical care and treatment; the preparation of a single national intersectoral government plan; the use of particular strategies for research, diagnosis and case tracing; and the implementation of a universal protocol for disease prevention and treatment of confirmed cases made it possible to control the disease with a health equity perspective.

34346657	[Confusion and abdominal pain after COVID-19 vaccination]. BACKGROUND: Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic trombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare phenomenon, that may present with diffuse and atypical symptoms. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of 63 years old female patient with abdominal pain, confusion and tromboctytopenia. CT scan shows sinustrombosis and trombosis of the vena renalis. The diagnosis VITT was confirmed by a positive HIT test. After initiating treatment with immunoglobulines and a non-heparinoid anticoagulans, symptoms improved and platelet count increased. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates that awareness in case of atypical symptoms and a history of vaccination is important to recognize this phenomenon.	Case Report
34292617	Evolution trace of SARS-CoV-2 from January 19 to March 12, 2020, in the United States. As a kind of human betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has endangered globally public health. As of January 2021, the virus had resulted in 2,209,195 deaths. By studying the evolution trend and characteristics of 265 SARS-CoV-2 strains in the United States from January to March, it is found that the strains can be divided into six clades, USA clade-1, USA clade-2, USA clade-3, USA clade-4, USA clade-5, and USA clade-6, in which US clade-1 may be the most ancestral clade, USA clade-2 is an interim clade of USA clade-1 and USA clade-3, the other three clades have similar codon usage pattern, while USA clade-6 is the newest and most adaptable clade. Mismatch analysis and protein alignment showed that the evolution of the clades arises from some special mutations in viral proteins, which may help the strain to invade, replicate, transcribe and so on. Compared with previous research and classifications, we suggest that clade O in GISAID should not be an independent clade and Wuhan-Hu-1 (EPI_ISL_402125) should not be an ancestral reference sequence. Our study decoded the evolutionary dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 in the early stage from the United States, which give some clues to infer the current evolution trend of SARS-CoV-2 and study the function of viral mutational protein.

34293380	Polysubstance use trends and variability among individuals with opioid use disorder in rural versus urban settings. Rural areas of the United States have been disproportionately impacted by the opioid epidemic, exacerbated by COVID-19-related economic upheavals. While polysubstance use is an important determinant of overdose risk, variability in polysubstance use as a result of numerous factors (e.g., access, preference) has yet to be described, particularly among rural persons with opioid use disorder (PWOUD). Survey data on past-month use of prescription and illicit opioids and 12 non-opioid psychoactive drug classes were analyzed from a national sample of rural (n=3872) and urban (n=8153) residents entering treatment for OUD from 2012 to 2019. Trend analyses for opioid and stimulant use were compared between rural and urban PWOUD. Latent class analyses assessed substance use trends through identified typologies of rural/urban PWOUD, which then underwent comparative analyses. By 2019, prescription opioid use remained greater in rural versus urban PWOUD, and methamphetamine use showed greater growth in rural, compared to urban areas. Latent class analyses identified variability in polysubstance use, with five identical subgroups in rural/urban PWOD: high polysubstance, polyprescription, prescription opioid-focused, prescription opioid-focused with polysubstance use, and illicit opioid-focused. Polyprescription was highest in rural areas, with illicit opioid-focused use highest in urban areas. Demographic characteristics, co-morbid conditions and healthcare coverage were all associated with between-group differences. There is significant variability in polysubstance use that may identify specific prevention and treatment needs for subpopulations of OUD patients: interventions focused on reducing opioid prescriptions, early engagement with mental health resources, wider distribution of naloxone, and screening/treatment plans that take into account the use of multiple substances.

34202195	COVID-19 Antibody Detecting Rapid Diagnostic Tests Show High Cross-Reactivity When Challenged with Pre-Pandemic Malaria, Schistosomiasis and Dengue Samples. COVID-19 Antibody Detecting Rapid Diagnostic Tests (COVID-19 Ab RDTs) are the preferred tool for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The present study challenged COVID-19 Ab RDTs with pre-pandemic samples of patients exposed to tropical pathogens. A retrospective study was performed on archived serum (n = 94) and EDTA whole blood (n = 126) samples obtained during 2010-2018 from 196 travelers with malaria (n = 170), schistosomiasis (n = 25) and dengue (n = 25). COVID-19 Ab RDTs were selected based on regulatory approval status, independent evaluation results and detecting antigens. Among 13 COVID-19 Ab RDT products, overall cross-reactivity was 18.5%; cross-reactivity for malaria, schistosomiasis and dengue was 20.3%, 18.1% and 7.5%, respectively. Cross-reactivity for current and recent malaria, malaria antibodies, Plasmodium species and parasite densities was similar. Cross-reactivity among the different RDT products ranged from 2.7% to 48.9% (median value 14.5%). IgM represented 67.9% of cross-reactive test lines. Cross-reactivity was not associated with detecting antigens, patient categories or disease (sub)groups, except for schistosomiasis (two products with >/=60% cross-reactivity). The high cross-reactivity for malaria, schistosomiasis and-to a lesser extent-dengue calls for risk mitigation when using COVID-19 Ab RDTs in co-endemic regions.	Diagnosis
34133314	Evaluation of a Social Media Campaign in Saskatchewan to Promote Healthy Eating During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Social Media Analysis and Qualitative Interview Study. BACKGROUND: The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic presented many sudden challenges regarding food, including grocery shopping changes (eg, reduced store hours, capacity restrictions, and empty store shelves due to food hoarding), restaurant closures, the need to cook more at home, and closures of food access programs. Eat Well Saskatchewan (EWS) implemented a 16-week social media campaign, #eatwellcovid19, led by a dietitian and nutrition student that focused on sharing stories submitted by the Saskatchewan public about how they were eating healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to describe the implementation of the #eatwellcovid19 social media campaign and the results from the evaluation of the campaign, which included campaign performance using social media metrics and experiences and perspectives of campaign followers. METHODS: Residents of Saskatchewan, Canada, were invited to submit personal stories and experiences to EWS about how they were eating healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic from April to August 2020. Each week, one to three stories were featured on EWS social media platforms-Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter-along with evidence-based nutrition information to help residents become more resilient to challenges related to food and nutrition experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals who submitted stories were entered into a weekly draw for a Can $100 grocery gift card. Social media metrics and semistructured qualitative interviews of campaign followers were used to evaluate the #eatwellcovid19 campaign. RESULTS: In total, 75 stories were submitted by 74 individuals on a variety of topics (eg, grocery shopping, traditional skills, and gardening), and 42 stories were featured on social media. EWS shared 194 #eatwellcovid19 posts across social media platforms (Facebook: n=100; Instagram: n=55; and Twitter: n=39). On Facebook, #eatawellcovid19 reached 100,571 followers and left 128,818 impressions, resulting in 9575 engagements. On Instagram, the campaign reached 11,310 followers, made 14,145 impressions, and received 823 likes and 15 comments. On Twitter, #eatwellcovid19 made 15,199 impressions and received 424 engagements. Featured story submission posts had the best engagement on Facebook and the most likes and comments on Instagram. The EWS social media pages reported increases in their following during the campaign (Instagram: +30%; Facebook: +14%; and Twitter: +12%). Results from the interviews revealed that there were two types of campaign followers: those who appreciated hearing the stories submitted by followers, as it helped them to feel connected to the community during social isolation, and those who appreciated the evidence-based information. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous stories were submitted to the #eatwellcovid19 social media campaign on various topics. On Instagram and Facebook, posts that featured these stories had the highest engagement. During this campaign, EWS's social media following increased by more than 10% on each platform. The approach used for the #eatwellcovid19 campaign could be considered by others looking to develop health promotion campaigns.	Prevention
34368502	A comprehensive review of various categories of face masks resistant to Covid-19. The science about the usage of face masks by the common public to avert COVID-19 transmission is proceeding swiftly. A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is probably through small respiratory droplets, and it is transmissible from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. According to the World Health Organization, wearing a mask in public can help reduce the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Different categories and types of mask and their usage are reviewed in this work. In a nutshell, this review work elucidates the aspects of utilizing the various face masks along with all possibilities to fight against the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19.	Prevention
34221413	Development and validation of early warning score systems for COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 is a major, urgent, and ongoing threat to global health. Globally more than 24 million have been infected and the disease has claimed more than a million lives as of November 2020. Predicting which patients will need respiratory support is important to guiding individual patient treatment and also to ensuring sufficient resources are available. The ability of six common Early Warning Scores (EWS) to identify respiratory deterioration defined as the need for advanced respiratory support (high-flow nasal oxygen, continuous positive airways pressure, non-invasive ventilation, intubation) within a prediction window of 24 h is evaluated. It is shown that these scores perform sub-optimally at this specific task. Therefore, an alternative EWS based on the Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) algorithm is developed that is able to predict deterioration within the next 24 h with high AUROC 94% and an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 70%, 96%, 70%, respectively. The GBT model outperformed the best EWS (LDTEWS:NEWS), increasing the AUROC by 14%. Our GBT model makes the prediction based on the current and baseline measures of routinely available vital signs and blood tests.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34214123	Dexamethasone may improve severe COVID-19 via ameliorating endothelial injury and inflammation: A preliminary pilot study. Dexamethasone provides benefits in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although data regarding immunological profiles and viral clearance are limited. This study aimed to evaluate for differences in biomarkers among patients with severe COVID-19 who did and did not receive dexamethasone. We measured plasma biomarkers of lung epithelial/endothelial injury and inflammation in 31 patients with severe COVID-19 and in 13 controls. Changes in biomarkers and clinical parameters were compared during the 7-day period among COVID-19 patients, and also according to dexamethasone use. Thirty-two patients with severe COVID-19 who received mechanical ventilation (n = 6), high-flow nasal cannula (n = 11), and supplemental oxygen (n = 15) were analyzed. Relative to controls, patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly higher concentrations of biomarkers related to glycocalyx shedding (endocan and syndecan-1), endothelial injury (von Willebrand factor), and inflammation (soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products [sRAGE] and interleukin-6). The 7-day decreases in biomarkers of endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2 [Ang-2] and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1]) and sRAGE, but not in the biomarker of lung epithelial injury (surfactant protein D), were correlated with decreases in C-reactive protein and radiologic score at day 7. Twenty patients (63%) received dexamethasone, and the dexamethasone and non-dexamethasone groups differed in terms of disease severity. However, dexamethasone was associated marginally with increased SpO2/FiO2 and significantly with decreases in C-reactive protein and radiologic score after adjusting for baseline imbalances. Furthermore, the dexamethasone group exhibited a significant decrease in the concentrations of Ang-2, ICAM-1, soluble form of the Tie2 receptor (a biomarker of glycocalyx shedding), and sRAGE. Both groups exhibited a clinically insignificant increase in the cycle threshold value. Severe COVID-19 may be characterized by more severe endothelial injury and inflammation, and less severe lung epithelial injury. There is a possibility that dexamethasone improved severe COVID-19 and related endothelial injury without delaying viral clearance.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34227076	Evolving biothreat of variant SARS-CoV-2 - molecular properties, virulence and epidemiology. SARS-CoV-2 are enveloped RNA viruses that belong to the family Coronaviridae of genus Beta coronavirus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The mutation rate is high among RNA viruses and in particular, coronavirus replication is error prone with an estimated mutation rate of 4x10-4 nucleotide substitutions per site per year. Variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported from various countries like United Kingdom, South Africa, Denmark, Brazil and India. These variants evolved due to mutations in spike gene of SARS-CoV-2. The most concerning variants are Variant of Concern (VOC) 202012/01 from United Kingdom and B.1.617 variant of India. Other variants include B.1.351 lineages, cluster 5/SARS-CoV-2 variant of Denmark, 501.V2 variant/SARS-CoV-2 variant of South Africa, lineage B.1.1.248/lineage P.1 of Brazil. Mutations in S protein may result in changes in the transmissibility and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. To date, alterations in virulence or pathogenicity have been reported among the variants from many parts of the globe. In our opinion, since the S protein is significantly altered, the suitability of existing vaccine specifically targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants is a major concern. The mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are a continuous and evolving process that may result in the transformation of naive SARS-CoV-2 into totally new subsets of antigenically different SARS-CoV-2 viruses over a period of time.

34287861	Clinical conditions and echocardiographic parameters associated with mortality in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recently recognized viral infective disease which can be complicated by acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) and cardiovascular complications including severe arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes, myocarditis and pulmonary embolism. The aim of the present study was to identify the clinical conditions and echocardiographic parameters associated with in-hospital mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: This is a multicentre retrospective observational study including seven Italian centres. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from 1 March to 22 April 2020 were included into study population. The association between baseline variables and risk of in-hospital mortality was assessed through multivariable logistic regression and competing risk analyses. RESULTS: Out of 1401 patients admitted at the participating centres with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, 226 (16.1%) underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and were included in the present analysis. In-hospital death occurred in 68 patients (30.1%). At multivariable analysis, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, P < .001), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE, P < .001) and ARDS (P < .001) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. At competing risk analysis, we found a significantly higher risk of mortality in patients with ARDS vs those without ARDS (HR: 7.66; CI: 3.95-14.8), in patients with TAPSE </=17 mm vs those with TAPSE >17 mm (HR: 5.08; CI: 3.15-8.19) and in patients with LVEF </=50% vs those with LVEF >50% (HR: 4.06; CI: 2.50-6.59). CONCLUSIONS: TTE might be a useful tool in risk stratification of patients with COVID-19. In particular, reduced LVEF and reduced TAPSE may help to identify patients at higher risk of death during hospitalization.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34132188	Hypothesis: Designation of Liposomal Scavenger System for Fighting against 2019-nCoV. 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 virus, is a member of the family Coronaviridae, which is responsible for the current pandemic of disease COVID-19. It is the seventh member of the family Coronaviridae, which infects humans, after 229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Fever, dry cough and severe pneumonia are seen as common symptoms at the early stages of COVID-19. Some cases progress to acute respiratory stress syndrome, septic shock, organ failure, and death. The development of an effective treatment or vaccination for treating or preventing this lethal condition is an urgent need in order to fight this crisis. Up to now, some effective vaccines with different efficacy profiles have been introduced. Herein, we have theoretically designed a scavenger system for gathering 2019-nCoVs, breaking them, and re-introducing them to the immune system.	Mechanism;Treatment
34292632	Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A retrospective cohort study. PURPOSE: The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenatio (ECMO) for rescue therapy of respiratory failure in critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of ECMO in the treatment of COVID-19 compared with conventional ventilation support. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data were collected on extremely critical patients with COVID-19 from January 2020 to March 2020 in intensive care unit of a hospital in charge by national rescue team in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of pandemic. Patients were classified into the ECMO group and the conventional ventilation non-ECMO group. Clinical characteristics, technical characteristics, laboratory results, mortality, and complications of the two groups were analyzed. RESULTS: 88 patients with extremely critical COVID-19 were screened; 34 received ECMO support and 31 received conventional ventilation support. Both groups had comparable characteristics at baseline in terms of age, gender, and comorbidities. Before ECMO or conventional therapy, patients in the two groups had sever acute respiratory distress syndrome with a mean partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2 /FiO2 ) ratio of 69.6 and 75.4, respectively. At the time of reporting, patients in the ECMO had significantly lower in-hospital mortality compared with the control group (58.8 vs. 93.5%, p = .001). CONCLUSION: ECMO is shown to decrease the mortality of extremely critical ill COVID-19 patients compared with the conventional treatment. Although complications occurred frequently, ECMO could still be a rescue therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 during the pandemic.	Treatment
34332542	SARS-CoV-2/DENV co-infection: a series of cases from the Federal District, Midwestern Brazil. BACKGROUND: Since the novel coronavirus disease outbreak, over 179.7 million people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, including the population living in dengue-endemic regions, particularly Latin America and Southeast Asia, raising concern about the impact of possible co-infections. METHODS: Thirteen SARS-CoV-2/DENV co-infection cases reported in Midwestern Brazil between April and September of 2020 are described. Information was gathered from hospital medical records regarding the most relevant clinical and laboratory findings, diagnostic process, therapeutic interventions, together with clinician-assessed outcomes and follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 13 cases, seven patients presented Acute Undifferentiated Febrile Syndrome and six had pre-existing co-morbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension and hypopituitarism. Two patients were pregnant. The most common symptoms and clinical signs reported at first evaluation were myalgia, fever and dyspnea. In six cases, the initial diagnosis was dengue fever, which delayed the diagnosis of concomitant infections. The most frequently applied therapeutic interventions were antibiotics and analgesics. In total, four patients were hospitalized. None of them were transferred to the intensive care unit or died. Clinical improvement was verified in all patients after a maximum of 21 days. CONCLUSIONS: The cases reported here highlight the challenges in differential diagnosis and the importance of considering concomitant infections, especially to improve clinical management and possible prevention measures. Failure to consider a SARS-CoV-2/DENV co-infection may impact both individual and community levels, especially in endemic areas.	Case Report
34352493	Seasonal and Regional Influences on Alcohol Consumption: An Analysis of Near-Real-Time Urine Drug Test Results in Those Seeking Health Care. AIMS: To examine the probability of detecting alcohol via urine drug testing (UDT) as influenced by age, gender, seasonality, geography, COVID-19, and time in those seeking health care. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of UDT results from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2020, was conducted using adult patient specimens submitted for testing by health care professionals as part of routine care. The UDT analysis used LC-MS/MS to detect two alcohol metabolites, ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate. Seasonal adjustment of positivity rates was accomplished using the STL method; trend analysis was performed on seasonally adjusted rates. Logistic regression was used to associate demographic features, and an interaction term for collection year and U.S. census division was included to help understand the changing nature of alcohol use over time and across divisions. RESULTS: Alcohol positivity rate shows strong seasonal changes with an oscillating profile that peaks in the summer and is at a low point in winter. The highest predicted positivity rate for alcohol was in male patients, 45-64 years of age, and from a primary care setting. Alcohol positivity peaked in 2016 and declined the following year. While remaining relatively steady since 2017, a small but significant increase was noted after the COVID-19 emergency declaration on March 13, 2020. The probability of being alcohol-positive varies significantly by geographic region, and not all regions are changing at the same rate. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol positivity in UDT in patients seeking health care is influenced by multiple factors and has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.	Prevention
34220287	Data-driven methods for present and future pandemics: Monitoring, modelling and managing. This survey analyses the role of data-driven methodologies for pandemic modelling and control. We provide a roadmap from the access to epidemiological data sources to the control of epidemic phenomena. We review the available methodologies and discuss the challenges in the development of data-driven strategies to combat the spreading of infectious diseases. Our aim is to bring together several different disciplines required to provide a holistic approach to epidemic analysis, such as data science, epidemiology, and systems-and-control theory. A 3M-analysis is presented, whose three pillars are: Monitoring, Modelling and Managing. The focus is on the potential of data-driven schemes to address three different challenges raised by a pandemic: (i) monitoring the epidemic evolution and assessing the effectiveness of the adopted countermeasures; (ii) modelling and forecasting the spread of the epidemic; (iii) making timely decisions to manage, mitigate and suppress the contagion. For each step of this roadmap, we review consolidated theoretical approaches (including data-driven methodologies that have been shown to be successful in other contexts) and discuss their application to past or present epidemics, such as Covid-19, as well as their potential application to future epidemics.

34203424	The Impact of COVID-19 on Smoking Behaviours and Support for Smoke-Free Zones in Saudi Arabia. This article focuses on the impact of COVID-19 on smoking and smoking cessation behaviours and support for smoke-free zones in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A pre-tested structured survey was distributed by email in October-November 2020 to students and staff at the University of Jeddah. Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics with summative content analysis of open text. Participants providing open text comments (n = 374/666; 56.4%) were non-smokers (n = 293; 78.3%), former smokers (n = 26; 7.0%) and current smokers (n = 55; 14.7%). Some had household members (n = 220; 58.8%) and friends who smoke (n = 198; 52.9%) plus daily exposure to secondhand smoke at home (n = 125; 33.4%). There was an awareness during COVID-19 of: smoking inside cafes/restaurants and other indoor and outdoor public places; exposure to warnings in the media both against and promoting smoking; widespread support for smoke-free zones. Smokers plans for accessing smoking cessation support are inconsistent with retrospective reports. Many express positivity highlighting reductions in smoking but there were also negative reports of increased smoking. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every aspect of society worldwide. People have been at home more with restricted freedom of movement and limitations on social liberty. These individual accounts can help to focus evidence-based smoking prevention and cessation programmes during and post-COVID-19.	Prevention
34130597	A Global Pandemic and Substance Use Disorder: Healthcare Professionals' Viewpoints on the Merging of Two Crises. INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has resulted in extraordinary adversities. Mandates such as distancing and variations to treatment services were implemented to slow transmission of the virus, but created new challenges for persons with Substance Use Disorder (SUD). To better understand this phenomenon, we surveyed healthcare professionals on how they believe COVID-19 has impacted persons with SUD and what needs to occur to effectively treat this vulnerable population. Methods: Attending physicians, residents, nurses, medical and nursing students, and other healthcare professionals were asked to respond to three open-ended questions related to the impact of COVID-19 on persons with SUD. Two independent coders reviewed the comments utilizing constant comparative analysis to develop themes. Results: Common themes of concern were found from the respective participants (n = 205) including: lack of access to treatment, feelings of isolation, negative impacts on mental health, and the possibility of relapse. Healthcare strategies to effectively treat and help persons with SUD included increasing access to treatment including telehealth, development of peer support groups, availability of mental health resources, development of enhanced communication channels between providers and patients, and systematic changes. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, overdose deaths have dramatically increased. As the short-term and long-term effects of the pandemic become more apparent, swift and comprehensive responses and policies must be enacted. This study provides insight from healthcare providers on the effects of the pandemic for persons with SUD. Many preexisting issues remain unresolved (e.g. stigma and healthcare disparities), and now the pandemic has presented new obstacles as noted by the providers. The findings from this study provide implications for important discussion regarding the development of strategies for substance use treatment and harm reduction.	Prevention
34339929	Prediction of two novel overlapping ORFs in the genome of SARS-CoV-2. Six candidate overlapping genes have been detected in SARS-CoV-2, yet current methods struggle to detect overlapping genes that recently originated. However, such genes might encode proteins beneficial to the virus, and provide a model system to understand gene birth. To complement existing detection methods, I first demonstrated that selection pressure to avoid stop codons in alternative reading frames is a driving force in the origin and retention of overlapping genes. I then built a detection method, CodScr, based on this selection pressure. Finally, I combined CodScr with methods that detect other properties of overlapping genes, such as a biased nucleotide and amino acid composition. I detected two novel ORFs (ORF-Sh and ORF-Mh), overlapping the spike and membrane genes respectively, which are under selection pressure and may be beneficial to SARS-CoV-2. ORF-Sh and ORF-Mh are present, as ORF uninterrupted by stop codons, in 100% and 95% of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, respectively.	Mechanism
34281149	Pharmacological Treatment of Patients with Mild to Moderate COVID-19: A Comprehensive Review. Mild to moderate COVID-19 can be found in about 80% of patients. Although mortality is low, mild to moderate COVID-19 may progress to severe or even critical stages in about one week. This poses a substantial burden on the health care system, and ultimately culminates in death or incapacitation and hospitalization. Therefore, pharmacological treatment is paramount for patients with this condition, especially those with recognized risk factors to disease progression. We conducted a comprehensive review in the medical literature searching for randomized studies carried out in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. A total of 14 randomized studies were identified, enrolling a total of 6848 patients. Nine studies (64%) were randomized, placebo-controlled trials, whereas five were open-label randomized trials (35%). We observed that Bamlanivimab and nitazoxanide reduced viral load, whereas ivermectin may have shortened time to viral clearance; Interferon Beta-1 reduced time to viral clearance and vitamin D reduced viral load; Favirapir, peginterferon, and levamisole improved clinical symptoms, whereas fluvoxamine halted disease progression; inhaled budesonide reduced the number of hospitalizations and visits to emergency departments; colchicine reduced the number of deaths and hospitalizations. Collectively, therefore, these findings show that treatment of early COVID-19 may be associated with reduced viral load, thus potentially decreasing disease spread in the community. Moreover, treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 may also be associated with improved clinical symptoms, hospitalization, and disease progression. We suggest that colchicine, inhaled budesonide, and nitazoxanide, along with nonpharmacological measures, based on efficacy and costs, may be used to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in middle-income countries.

34378968	TMPRSS2 and RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Are Effective Targets of Therapeutic Intervention for Treatment of COVID-19 Caused by SARS-CoV-2 Variants (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the development of therapeutic interventions is urgently needed. So far, monoclonal antibodies and drug repositioning are the main methods for drug development, and this effort was partially successful. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has been reported in many parts of the world, and the main concern is whether the current vaccines and therapeutics are still effective against these variant viruses. Viral entry and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are the main targets of current drug development; therefore, the inhibitory effects of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and RdRp inhibitors were compared among the early SARS-CoV-2 isolate (lineage A) and the two recent variants (lineage B.1.1.7 and lineage B.1.351) identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, respectively. Our in vitro analysis of viral replication showed that the drugs targeting TMPRSS2 and RdRp are equally effective against the two variants of concern. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic is causing unprecedented global problems in both public health and human society. While some vaccines and monoclonal antibodies were successfully developed very quickly and are currently being used, numerous variants of the causative SARS-CoV-2 are emerging and threatening the efficacy of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. In order to respond to this challenge, we assessed antiviral efficacy of small-molecule inhibitors that are being developed for treatment of COVID-19 and found that they are still very effective against the SARS-CoV-2 variants. Since most small-molecule inhibitors target viral or host factors other than the mutated sequence of the viral spike protein, they are expected to be potent control measures against the COVID-19 pandemic.

34287755	HIV Risk Among Urban and Suburban People Who Inject Drugs: Elevated Risk Among Fentanyl and Cocaine Injectors in Maryland. Drug overdose remains a leading cause of death in the US, with growing rates attributable to illicit fentanyl use. Recent HIV outbreaks among people who inject drugs (PWID) and service disruptions from COVID-19 have renewed concerns on HIV resurgence. We examined the relationship between fentanyl use and three injection-related HIV risk behaviors among PWID in Baltimore City (BC) and Anne Arundel Country (AAC), Maryland. PWID (N = 283) were recruited to the study through targeted sampling at street-based locations in BC and AAC from July 2018 to March 2020. Receptive syringe sharing (RSS) [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-6.3] and daily injecting (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.0-3.6) were associated with injecting fentanyl and cocaine together. Fentanyl availability and COVID-19 bring new HIV prevention challenges, particularly among those who inject fentanyl with cocaine, highlighting the importance to expand and sustain harm reduction, prevention, and treatment services for PWID to reduce HIV and overdose burden.

34226871	Target-based drug discovery, ADMET profiling and bioactivity studies of antibiotics as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)). A recent outbreak of a new strain of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global health burden, which has resulted in deaths. No proven drug has been found to effectively cure this fast-spreading infection, hence the need to explore old drugs with the known profile in tackling this pandemic. A computer-aided drug design approach involving virtual screening was used to obtain the binding scores and inhibiting efficiencies of previously known antibiotics against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)). The drug-likeness analysis of the repurposed drugs were done using the Molinspiration chemoinformatics tool, while the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) analysis was carried out using ADMET SAR-2 webserver. Other analyses performed include bioactivities of the repurposed drug as a probable anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent and oral bioavailability analyses among others. The results were compared with those of drugs currently involved in clinical trials in the ongoing pandemic. Although antibiotics have been speculated to be of no use in the treatment of viral infections, literature has emerged lately to reveal the antiviral potential and immune-boosting ability of antibiotics. This study identified Tarivid and Ciprofloxacin with binding affinities of - 8.3 kcal/mol and - 8.1 kcal/mol, respectively as significant inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 (M(pro)) with better pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness and oral bioavailability, bioactivity properties, ADMET properties and inhibitory strength compared to Remdesivir (- 7.6 kcal/mol) and Azithromycin (- 6.3 kcal/mol). These observations will provide insight for further research (clinical trial) in the cure and management of COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34363872	Contingency planning for healthcare worker masks in case of medical supply chain failure: Lessons learned in novel mask manufacturing from COVID-19 Pandemic. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic placed unprecedented strain on the medical supply chain. Early in the pandemic, uncertainty regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) was high. Protecting healthcare workers from contracting illness is critical to preserve trust and workforce capacity. METHODS: We describe an initiative to design and manufacture a novel, re-usable, half-face respirator in case conventional medical supply chain failed to meet demand. It required new collaboration between the hospital, physicians, the medical school, and the school of engineering. We describe organizational priorities, constraints, and process of design, testing and approval as the health system engaged for the first time directly with the design and manufacturing process for PPE. RESULTS: An original mask design was developed, and the University Hospital had an initial batch of this novel mask manufactured during the first wave of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. These masks, and the die necessary to produce more, is in reserve in case of depletion of stores of conventionally sourced PPE. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated fragility of medical supply chain. Organizations considering similar efforts should anticipate constraints on raw material supply chain and be flexible, adaptive, and fast. The incident command structure was vital to identifying priority areas needing alternative approaches, creating connections, and providing rapid approvals. We found organizational value in demonstrating commitment to assuring PPE supplies for healthcare worker safety.	Prevention
34378961	Performance Evaluation of the MatMaCorp COVID-19 2SF Assay for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Nasopharyngeal Swabs. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has taken an unprecedented toll on clinical diagnostic testing, and the need for PCR-based testing remains to be met. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the recommended method for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to the inherent advantages in sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the MatMaCorp COVID-19 2SF test, a reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, run on the Solas 8 instrument (MatMaCorp, Lincoln, NE). The Solas 8 device is portable, and the kit is a lab-in-a-box design which provides reagents in a shelf-stable lyophilized powder format. A total of 78 remnant clinical specimens were used to evaluate the COVID-19 2SF test. Sixty-two clinical specimens originally tested by the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay (Cepheid, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) were used to evaluate the clinical accuracy of the COVID-19 2SF test. The negative percent agreement (NPA) was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83.9% to 100%), and the positive percent agreement (PPA) was 85.4% (95% CI, 70.8% to 94.4%). Sixteen remnant specimens positive for other common respiratory pathogens (FilmArray respiratory panel 2.0; BioFire, Salt Lake City, UT) were assayed on the Solas 8 device to evaluate specificity. No cross-reactivity with other respiratory pathogens was identified. The unique lab-in-a-box design and shelf-stable reagents of the MatMaCorp COVID-19 2SF test offer laboratories a rapid option for a diagnostic NAAT for SARS-CoV-2 that can help meet diagnostic needs. IMPORTANCE The demand for molecular testing for COVID-19 remains to be met. This study of the MatMaCorp Solas 8 device and COVID-19 test provides the first evaluation of this platform.	Diagnosis
34211739	Management of minor burns during the COVID-19 pandemic: A patient-centred approach. Introduction: The UK government introduced lockdown measures on 23 March 2020 due to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A restructuring of clinical services was necessary to accommodate mandatory changes while also maintaining the best possible standards for patient care. The present study explored the initial management, follow-up and patient-reported outcomes of burn injuries <15% total body surface area (TBSA) during the height of the COVID-19 lockdown at a tertiary burns centre. Methods: A retrospective review of all adult patients with burns <15% TBSA during the national lockdown (23 March 2020 to 10 May 2020) was undertaken at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB), UK. All referrals from non-QEHB telemedicine (external) or QEHB emergency (internal) departments were reviewed for management, length of hospital stay and pattern of follow-up (ward attender, self-care, community or outreach nurses). A telephone survey based on a structured questionnaire was conducted to establish patients' satisfaction. Results: A total of 84 burn patients were included in the study. The mean age was 39 years (age range = 19-91 years) and the male:female ratio was 4:1. Patients were managed non-operatively (n = 69, 82%) or operatively (n = 15, 18%). Patients attended the ward attender acute burns clinic only once (n = 36, 61%). The telephone survey captured 70% (n = 59) of the study population and 57 patients (97% of respondents) were pleased with the ongoing care and burn healing. Conclusion: The integration of patient led self-care, reduction in admissions, minimal clinics attendance and a telemedicine follow-up is an effective model for small burns management during the COVID-19 pandemic. A high degree of patient satisfaction was achieved with continuous and approachable communication channels with the burn multidisciplinary team. We continue to implement this effective model of burns management throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent period. Lay Summary: The lockdown measures due to the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic affected the way we manage all medical emergencies including burns. The initial management, follow-up and patient satisfaction for small burn injuries during lockdown has not been reported previously. The aim of this study is to examine the outcome in terms of small burn management, hospital stay, number of clinic reviews, healing and patient satisfaction during the lockdown period in a burn centre in the UK. This would look at the need for operations and whether patients stayed longer if they required an intervention. We reviewed adult patients with small burns during the national lockdown (23 March 2020 to 10 May 2020) at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB). All referrals from telemedicine, referral system (external) or QEHB (internal) were reviewed for management, length of hospital stay and pattern of follow-up. Patients were reviewed in the acute burns clinic and given advice for burn management and dressing for self-care. Follow-up was mostly via email (telemedicine) A telephone survey based on a structured questionnaire was conducted to find out patients' satisfaction. Four times more men than women had small burns during the lockdown period. The average age was 39 years. The majority were managed conservatively with dressings (82%) and a small proportion required an operation (18%). Most patients attended the acute burns clinic only once (61%) for initial assessment and management. The telephone survey captured 70% of patient and 97% of respondents were pleased with the care and burn healing. The integration of patient-led self-care, reduction in admissions, minimal clinics attendance and a telemedicine follow-up is an effective model for burns management during the COVID-19 pandemic. A high degree of patient satisfaction was achieved with continuous and approachable communication channels with burn multidisciplinary team. We continue to implement this effective model of burns management throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent period.	Prevention
34226902	Models of care for chronic myeloid leukemia patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom: Changes in patient attitudes to remote consultations and future implications. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has presented numerous challenges to the provision of patient care within hematology. We undertook a questionnaire-based study investigating the experiences and opinions of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the UK in relation to the different models of follow-up care received during the pandemic. One hundred fifty-four patients completed the online questionnaire. Only 19% of patients had experienced remote clinics prior to the pandemic compared with 91% afterward. After having experience of remote clinics, the proportion of patients who were positive about the remote clinic concept increased from 34% to 52% (P < .05). However, when asked to compare their experiences with face to face versus remote clinics, 48% preferred face-to-face clinics compared with 17% preferring remote clinics (35% expressed no preference). During the pandemic, frequency of blood tests was unchanged for 71% of patients, although they were performed in a number of different locations. The majority of patients (57%) had medication delivered to their home, with a small number (8%) having difficulty obtaining their medication. In terms of future models of care, 72% of patients were in favor of building remote appointments into the clinic model with 61% expressing a preference for a mixture of remote and face-to-face appointments. There was also interest in greater utilization of primary care for blood testing. Our findings should help optimize future models of care for CML patients.	Prevention
34199857	Prevalence and Impact of Atrial Fibrillation in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. BACKGROUND: In patients with COVID-19, cardiovascular complications are common and associated with poor prognosis. Among these, an association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and COVID-19 has been described; however, the extent of this relationship is unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the epidemiology of AF in COVID-19 patients and its impact on all-cause mortality. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed and reported according to PRISMA guidelines, and a protocol for this study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021227950). PubMed and EMBASE were systematically searched for relevant studies. A random-effects model was used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Overall, 31 studies were included in the analysis, with a total number of 187,716 COVID-19 patients. The prevalence of AF was found to be as high as 8% of patients with COVID-19 (95% CI: 6.3-10.2%, 95% prediction intervals (PI): 2.0-27.1%), with a high degree of heterogeneity between studies; a multiple meta-regression model including geographical location, age, hypertension, and diabetes showed that these factors accounted for more than a third of the heterogeneity. AF COVID-19 patients were less likely to be female but more likely older, hypertensive, and with a critical status than those without AF. Patients with AF showed a significant increase in the risk of all-cause mortality (OR: 3.97, 95% CI: 2.76-5.71), with a high degree of heterogeneity. A sensitivity analysis focusing on new-onset AF showed the consistency of these results. CONCLUSIONS: Among COVID-19 patients, AF is found in 8% of patients. AF COVID-19 patients are older, more hypertensive, and more likely to have a critical status. In COVID-19 patients, AF is associated with a 4-fold higher risk of death. Further studies are needed to define the best treatment strategies to improve the prognosis of AF COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34284839	COVID-19 age-dependent immunology and clinical outcomes: implications for vaccines. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Understanding the evolution of the virus, and immune-pathogenic processes are critical for designing future therapeutic interventions. In this review, we collate information on the structure, genome, viral life cycle, and adult and pediatric host immune responses in response to SARS-CoV-2. The immunological responses are a prototype of the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis to explain the socio-geographic differences impacting the severity and mortality rates in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The DOHaD hypothesis identifies the relevance of trained innate immunity, age groups, and geography for effective vaccinations. As COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out, it may be pertinent to assess population-based immunological responses to understand the effectiveness and safety across different populations and age groups.

34209711	Cytomegalovirus as an Uninvited Guest in the Response to Vaccines in People Living with HIV. In stark contrast to the rapid development of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine is still lacking. Furthermore, despite virologic suppression and CD4 T-cell count normalization with antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV (PLWH) still exhibit increased morbidity and mortality compared to the general population. Such differences in health outcomes are related to higher risk behaviors, but also to HIV-related immune activation and viral coinfections. Among these coinfections, cytomegalovirus (CMV) latent infection is a well-known inducer of long-term immune dysregulation. Cytomegalovirus contributes to the persistent immune activation in PLWH receiving ART by directly skewing immune response toward itself, and by increasing immune activation through modification of the gut microbiota and microbial translocation. In addition, through induction of immunosenescence, CMV has been associated with a decreased response to infections and vaccines. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the influence of CMV on the immune system, the mechanisms underlying a reduced response to vaccines, and discuss new therapeutic advances targeting CMV that could be used to improve vaccine response in PLWH.

34291032	Using Proper Mean Generation Intervals in Modeling of COVID-19. In susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemic models, with the exponentially distributed duration of exposed/infectious statuses, the mean generation interval (GI, time lag between infections of a primary case and its secondary case) equals the mean latent period (LP) plus the mean infectious period (IP). It was widely reported that the GI for COVID-19 is as short as 5 days. However, many works in top journals used longer LP or IP with the sum (i.e., GI), e.g., >7 days. This discrepancy will lead to overestimated basic reproductive number and exaggerated expectation of infection attack rate (AR) and control efficacy. We argue that it is important to use suitable epidemiological parameter values for proper estimation/prediction. Furthermore, we propose an epidemic model to assess the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 for Belgium, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We estimated a time-varying reproductive number [R 0(t)] based on the COVID-19 deaths data and we found that Belgium has the highest AR followed by Israel and the UAE.

34199582	"Patient Experiences with the Transition to Telephone Counseling during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Background: To identify and document the treatment experiences among patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in the context of the rapid move from in-person to telephone counseling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Participants (n = 237) completed a survey with open-ended questions that included the following domains: (1) satisfaction with telephone counseling, (2) perceived convenience, (3) changes to the therapeutic relationship, (4) perceived impact on substance use recovery, and (5) general feedback. Responses were coded using thematic analysis. Codes were subsequently organized into themes and subthemes (covering 98% of responses). Interrater reliability for coding of participants' responses ranged from 0.89 to 0.95. Results: Overall, patients reported that telephone counseling improved the therapeutic experience. Specifically, 74% of respondents were coded as providing responses consistently indicating ""positive valency"". ""Positive valency"" responses include: (1) feeling supported, (2) greater comfort and privacy, (3) increased access to counselors, and (4) resolved transportation barriers. Conversely, ""negative valency"" responses include: (1) impersonal experience and (2) reduced privacy. Conclusions: Telephone counseling presents its own set of challenges that should be investigated further to improve the quality of care and long-term patient outcomes."	Prevention
34290010	Capnocytophaga canimorsus meningitis and bacteraemia without a dog bite in an immunocompetent individual. We describe the case of an immunocompetent 75-year-old man with Capnocytophaga canimorsus bacteraemia and meningitis. C. canimorsus is commonly found in the oral flora of dogs with human infection typically occurring following a bite. Unusually, while our patient was a dog owner, there was no history of bite nor scratch mark. Admission blood cultures flagged positive for Gram-negative bacilli, but prolonged molecular analysis was required before C. canimorsus was isolated in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. There is a high mortality rate in invasive infection, and in our patient's case, antibiotic therapy was commenced prior to laboratory confirmation with our patient making a complete recovery. This case highlights the importance of including C. canimorsus in the differential diagnosis of unwell patients who keep dogs, even without a bite. This case occurred amid heightened awareness of COVID-19, which may represent predisposition for zoonoses during social isolation and increased human-pet contact.	Case Report

We report a case of spontaneous pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, emphysema subcutaneous and pneumorrhachis, occurring in an adolescent resulting positive to SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab. At the admission in Emergency Department, the child presented with left cervical and sternal pain, without respiratory symptoms. Radiological studies showed sizeable pneumomediastinum, bilateral apical pneumothorax, massive emphysema subcutaneous and pneumorrhachis. Patients' clinical conditions stood stable during the monitoring and he only needed conservative management. To our knowledge, this is the first description of spontaneous pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, emphysema subcutaneous and pneumorrhachis, in a COVID-19 adolescent without concomitant pneumonia.

34342517	Immunogenicity and safety of the CoronaVac vaccine in patients with cancer receiving active systemic therapy. Aim: To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the CoronaVac vaccine in patients with cancer receiving active systemic therapy. Methods: This multicenter, prospective, observational study was conducted with 47 patients receiving active systemic therapy for cancer. CoronaVac was administered as two doses (3 mug/day) on days 0 and 28. Antibody level higher than 1 IU/ml was defined as 'immunogenicity.' Results: The immunogenicity rate was 63.8% (30/47) in the entire patient group, 59.5% (25/42) in those receiving at least one cytotoxic drug and 100% (five of five) in those receiving monoclonal antibody or immunotherapy alone. Age was an independent predictive factor for immunogenicity (odds ratio: 0.830; p = 0.043). Conclusion: More than half of cancer patients receiving active systemic therapy developed immunogenicity.

34198838	Acute Myocardial Infarction Due to Microvascular Obstruction in a Young Woman Who Recently Recovered from COVID-19 Infection. Although cardiovascular complications are common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, those with milder cases who recovered at home are less studied. Here, we report the case of a young woman who recently recovered from COVID-19 at home. A week after recovery, she was admitted to our institution with acute chest pain, signs of ischemia on the electrocardiogram and elevated cardiac troponins. Coronary angiography showed normal epicardial coronary arteries, but the cardiac magnetic resonance showed transmural late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the mid-ventricular level of the lateral wall. The findings were strongly suggestive of a minor transmural myocardial infarction. This case report highlights the role of multimodality imaging in detecting cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients as well as the fact that mild COVID-19 cases who recovered at home are also exposed to thromboembolic events during the convalescent period.

34213716	U shape association of hemoglobin level with in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients. Our hypothesis was that high hemoglobin (Hb) level might be associated with hypercoagulable state and death due to COVID-19. Of the 9467 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, patients were subdivided into 5 groups based on the level of Hb; Hb < 10 g/dL, 10 g/dL </= Hb < 12 g/dL, 12 g/dL </= Hb < 14 g/dL, 14 g/dL </= Hb < 16 g/dL, and Hb >/= 16 g/dL. Compared to patients with 12 g/dL </= Hb < 14 g/dL, patients with Hb >/= 16 g/dL had significantly higher adjusted in-hospital mortality (OR [95% CI] 1.62 [1.15-2.27], P = 0.005).	Diagnosis;Treatment
34227718	Utilization of telehealth for outpatient diabetes management during COVID-19 pandemic: how did the patients fare? BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many outpatient services at public hospitals, including diabetes services, had adopted telehealth appointments for their clinic patients. There was concern that patients' glycaemic control may worsen during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with diabetes managed by telehealth consultations over 5 months at two metropolitan hospitals in Sydney. Their attendance rate, glycaemic control and unplanned admissions to hospital were assessed, and these were compared to the same period 12 months prior, when patients were reviewed via face-to-face appointments. RESULTS: Between April and September 2020, attendance rate for telehealth consultation at the diabetes services at the two hospitals was 88.9% (884 out of 994) in 2020, which was higher than in 2019 (85.2%, 818 out of 959, p = 0.016) when patients attended via face-to-face appointments. Of the 629 patients reviewed via telehealth in 2020 and who had been with our service for over 12 months, glycaemic control was better in 2020 (HbA1c 7.8 +/- 1.4% (62 +/- 15 mmol/mol)) compared to 12 months ago (8.2 +/- 1.7% (66 +/- 19 mmol/mol), p < 0.001). There was no difference in the number of unplanned admissions for this cohort in 2020 (n = 58, 9.2%) compared to 2019 (n = 75, 11.9%, p = 0.100). CONCLUSION: The study showed that for patients with diabetes who received care via telehealth consultations during COVID-19 lockdown, their glycaemic control was slightly better and unplanned admission rates was not higher compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Telehealth consultation offers an important care delivery option in the management of patients with diabetes under the circumstances. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

34287226	Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss in Mild COVID-19: Case Series and Analysis of the Literature. BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of otoneurological involvement of SARS-CoV-2, such as tinnitus and balance disorders and smell and taste disorders, but HL in COVID-19 patients has still been marginally studied. Investigating the role of SARS-CoV-2 as an aetiological factor of Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SSNHL) may offer the opportunity to address treatment strategies to maximize clinical recovery and avoid side effects. METHODS AND RESULTS: For this purpose, we will present case studies of five patients who experienced SSNHL during COVID-19. Patients were selected from COVID-19 positive adult subjects with mild clinical presentation, admitted to the outpatient Ear Nose and Throat Department of Cardarelli Hospital due to the onset of SSNHL during the infection. All underwent a complete audio-vestibular investigation before and after SSNHL treatment protocol. Each patient is described with a detailed analysis. CONCLUSIONS: SSNHL could be an occasional symptom of COVID-19, even in mild manifestations of the disease. Our experience leads us to underline the value of promptly recognizing and addressing this and other uncommon symptoms, giving patients the opportunity to receive early treatment.	Case Report
34225580	Application of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Systems Pharmacology in Drug Prevention and Treatment against COVID-19. A novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 is causing the severe acute pneumonia (COVID-19) and rapid spread nationally and internationally, resulting in a major global health emergency. Chinese governments and scientists have implemented a series of rigorous measures and scientific research to prevent and control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is still no specific antiviral drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. It has been proven that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) exerts an important role in the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 during the outbreak. Although the therapeutic effects of these TCM formulas are attractive, the molecular mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. An emerging strategy of systems pharmacology has been proposed to be a promising method to interpret drug action in complex biological systems and quickly screen out the bioactive compounds from TCM to treat treatment of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, in this study, the epidemiology, TCM therapy, and the systems pharmacology-based method for TCM are reviewed for COVID-19 to provide a perspective for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further efforts should be made to reduce disease burden and improve the ability to design antiviral drugs and vaccines, which will benefit the health care system, economic development and even social stability.

34227136	COVID-19 and the impact on rural and black church Congregants: Results of the C-M-C project. The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating effects on Black and rural populations with a mortality rate among Blacks three times that of Whites and both rural and Black populations experiencing limited access to COVID-19 resources. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the health, financial, and psychological impact of COVID-19 among rural White Appalachian and Black nonrural central Kentucky church congregants. Secondarily we sought to examine the association between sociodemographics and behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs regarding COVID-19 and intent to vaccinate. We used a cross sectional survey design developed with the constructs of the Health Belief and Theory of Planned Behavior models. The majority of the 942 respondents were >/=36 years. A total of 54% were from central Kentucky, while 47.5% were from Appalachia. Among all participants, the pandemic worsened anxiety and depression and delayed access to medical care. There were no associations between sociodemographics and practicing COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Appalachian region was associated with financial burden and delay in medical care (p = 0.03). Appalachian respondents had lower perceived benefit and attitude for COVID-19 prevention behaviors (p = 0.004 and <0.001, respectively). Among all respondents, the perceived risk of contracting COVID was high (54%), yet 33.2% indicated unlikeliness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if offered. The COVID-19 pandemic had a differential impact on White rural and Black nonrural populations. Nurses and public health officials should assess knowledge and explore patient's attitudes regarding COVID-19 prevention behaviors, as well as advocate for public health resources to reduce the differential impact of COVID-19 on these at-risk populations.

34284915	Physical Therapy and Sedation While on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for COVID-19-Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine whether patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) achieved lower rates of physical therapy participation and required more sedation than those on ECMO without COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational, matched-cohort study. SETTING: Bicenter academic quaternary medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: All adults on ECMO for severe COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during 2020 and matched (matched 1:1 based on age +/- 15 years and medical center) adults on ECMO for ARDS not associated with COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Observational only. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Measurements were collected retrospectively during the first 20 days of ECMO support and included daily levels of physical therapy activity, number of daily sedation infusions and doses, and level of sedation and agitation (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score). During the first 20 days of ECMO support, the 22 patients who were on ECMO for COVID-19-associated ARDS achieved a similar proportion of days with active physical therapy participation while on ECMO compared to matched patients on ECMO for non-COVID-19 ARDS (22.5% v 7.5%, respectively; p value 0.43), a similar proportion of days with Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score >/=-2 while on ECMO (47.5% v 27.5%, respectively; p value 0.065), and a similar proportion of days with chemical paralysis while on ECMO (8.4% v 18.0%, respectively; p value 0.35). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this matched cohort study supported that sedation requirements were not dramatically greater and did not significantly limit early physical therapy for patients who had COVID-19-associated ARDS and were on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) versus those without COVID-19-associated ARDS who were on VV-ECMO.

34200204	Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase with New Nucleoside Analogues. Despite the fact that COVID-19 vaccines are already available on the market, there have not been any effective FDA-approved drugs to treat this disease. There are several already known drugs that through drug repositioning have shown an inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These drugs are included in the family of nucleoside analogues. In our efforts, we synthesized a group of new nucleoside analogues, which are modified at the sugar moiety that is replaced by a quinazoline entity. Different nucleobase derivatives are used in order to increase the inhibition. Five new nucleoside analogues were evaluated with in vitro assays for targeting polymerase of SARS-CoV-2.

Here, we show that soft, flexible, elongated NPs with poly-ethylene-oxide (PEO) exteriors and poly-butadiene (PBD) interiors - PEO-PBD filomicelles - interact directly with the major high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor and SARS-CoV-2 uptake factor, SR-BI. Filomicelles have a ~ 6-fold stronger interaction with reconstituted SR-BI than PEO-PBD spheres. HDL, and the lipid transport inhibitor, BLT-1, both block the uptake of filomicelles by macrophages and Idla7 cells, the latter are constitutively expressing SR-BI (Idla7-SR-BI). Co-injections of HDL and filomicelles into wild-type mice reduced filomicelle signal in the liver and increased filomicelle plasma levels. The same was true with SCARB1(-/-) mice. SR-BI binding is followed by phagocytosis for filomicelle macrophage entry, but only SR-BI is needed for entry into Idla7-SR-BI cells. PEO-PBD spheres did not interact strongly with SR-BI in the above experiments. The results show elongated PEO-based NPs can bind cells via cooperativity among SR-BI receptors on cell surfaces.

34224754	Evaluation of a surrogate virus neutralization test for high-throughput serosurveillance of SARS-CoV-2. High-throughput serological tests that can detect neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are desirable for serosurveillance and vaccine efficacy evaluation. Although the conventional neutralization test (cVNT) remains the gold standard to confirm the presence of neutralizing antibodies in sera, the test is too labour-intensive for massive screening programs and less reproducible as live virus and cell culture is involved. Here, we performed an independent evaluation of a commercially available surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT, GenScript cPass) that can be done without biosafety level 3 containment in less than 2 hours. When using the cVNT and a Luminex multiplex immunoassay (MIA) as reference, the sVNT obtained a sensitivity of 94% (CI 90-96%) on a panel of 317 immune sera that were obtained from hospitalized and mild COVID-19 cases from Belgium and a sensitivity of 89% (CI 81-93%) on a panel of 184 healthcare workers from the Democratic Republic of Congo. We also found strong antibody titer correlations (rs>0.8) among the different techniques used. In conclusion, our evaluation suggests that the sVNT could be a powerful tool to monitor/detect neutralising antibodies in cohort and population studies. The technique could be especially useful for vaccine evaluation studies in sub-Saharan Africa where the basic infrastructure to perform cVNTs is lacking.	Diagnosis
34339730	Abnormality in the NK cell population is prolonged in severe COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: Our understanding of adaptive immune responses in COVID-19 patients is rapidly evolving, but information on the innate immune responses by natural killer (NK) cells is still insufficient. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the phenotypic and functional status of NK cells and their changes during the course of mild and severe COVID-19. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and flow cytometric analysis of NK cells from patients with mild and severe COVID-19 at multiple time points in the course of the disease using cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). RESULTS: In RNA-seq analysis, the NK cells exhibited distinctive features compared to healthy donors, with significant enrichment of pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. Intriguingly, we found that the unconventional CD56(dim)CD16(neg) (uCD56(dim)) NK cell population expanded in cryopreserved PBMCs from COVID-19 patients regardless of disease severity, accompanied by decreased NK cell cytotoxicity. The NK cell population was rapidly normalized alongside the disappearance of uCD56(dim) NK cells and the recovery of NK cell cytotoxicity in mild COVID-19 patients, but this occurred slowly in severe COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The current longitudinal study provides a deep understanding of the NK cell biology in COVID-19.	Mechanism
34340958	(18)F-FDG-PET/CT in SARS-CoV-2 infection and its sequelae. In recent months, much of the scientific efforts have focused on research on SARSCoV-2 infection and its consequences in humans. Still, many aspects remain unknown. It is known that the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 is multifactorial and that its extension goes beyond lung inflammation and the acute phase, with the appearance of numerous complications and sequelae. To date, knowledge about the usefulness of (18)F-FDG-PET/CT in the acute phase has been limited to the incidental detection of SARS-CoV-2 unsuspected pneumonia. Recent studies have been appearing collecting the findings of (18)F-FDG-PET/CT in long COVID-19 or persistent COVID-19 state as well as the alterations caused after mass vaccination of the population in the metabolic studies. This work aims to review the existing literature focusing on these three issues and to briefly present our own preliminary experience.	Diagnosis
34346185	Disease Flare and Reactogenicity in Patients with Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases Following Two-Dose SARS-CoV-2 Messenger RNA Vaccination. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate disease flare and post-vaccination reactions (reactogenicity) in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) following two-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. METHODS: 1377 patients with RMD who received two-dose SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccination between 16 December 2020 and April 15, 2021 completed questionnaires detailing local and systemic reactions experienced within 7 days of each vaccine dose (D1, D2), and one month after D2 detailing flare of RMD. Associations between demographic/clinical characteristics and flare requiring treatment were evaluated using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: 11 percent reported flare requiring treatment; there were no reports of severe flares. Flare was associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (IRR 2.09, p=0.02), flare in the six months preceding vaccination (IRR 2.36, p<0.001) and use of combination immunomodulatory therapy (IRR 1.95, p<0.001). The most frequently reported local and systemic reactions included injection site pain (D1 87%, D2 86%) and fatigue (D1 60%, D2 80%); reactogenicity increased after D2, particularly for systemic reactions. No allergic reactions or SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses were reported. CONCLUSION: Flare of underlying RMD following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was uncommon. There were no reports of severe flare. Local and systemic reactions typically did not interfere with daily activity. These early safety data can help address vaccine hesitancy in patients with RMD.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34367265	Metabolomics in the Diagnosis and Prognosis of COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic triggered an unprecedented global effort in developing rapid and inexpensive diagnostic and prognostic tools. Since the genome of SARS-CoV-2 was uncovered, detection of viral RNA by RT-qPCR has played the most significant role in preventing the spread of the virus through early detection and tracing of suspected COVID-19 cases and through screening of at-risk population. However, a large number of alternative test methods based on SARS-CoV-2 RNA or proteins or host factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been developed and evaluated. The application of metabolomics in infectious disease diagnostics is an evolving area of science that was boosted by the urgency of COVID-19 pandemic. Metabolomics approaches that rely on the analysis of volatile organic compounds exhaled by COVID-19 patients hold promise for applications in a large-scale screening of population in point-of-care (POC) setting. On the other hand, successful application of mass-spectrometry to detect specific spectral signatures associated with COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal swab specimens may significantly save the cost and turnaround time of COVID-19 testing in the diagnostic microbiology and virology laboratories. Active research is also ongoing on the discovery of potential metabolomics-based prognostic markers for the disease that can be applied to serum or plasma specimens. Several metabolic pathways related to amino acid, lipid and energy metabolism were found to be affected by severe disease with COVID-19. In particular, tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway were persistently dysregulated in several independent studies, suggesting the roles of several metabolites of this pathway such as tryptophan, kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine as potential prognostic markers of the disease. However, standardization of the test methods and large-scale clinical validation are necessary before these tests can be applied in a clinical setting. With rapidly expanding data on the metabolic profiles of COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of severity, it is likely that metabolomics will play an important role in near future in predicting the outcome of the disease with a greater degree of certainty.

34337637	Dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. By repurposing DNICs designed for other medicinal purposes, the possibility of protease inhibition was investigated in silico using AutoDock 4.2.6 (AD4) and in vitro via a FRET protease assay. AD4 was validated as a predictive computational tool for coordinatively unsaturated DNIC binding using the only known crystal structure of a protein-bound DNIC, PDB-1ZGN (calculation RMSD = 1.77). From the in silico data the dimeric DNICs TGTA-RRE, [(mu-S-TGTA)Fe(NO)2]2 (TGTA = 1-thio-beta-d-glucose tetraacetate) and TG-RRE, [(mu-S-TG)Fe(NO)2]2 (TG = 1-thio-beta-d-glucose) were identified as promising leads for inhibition via coordinative inhibition at Cys-145 of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (SC2Mpro). In vitro studies indicate inhibition of protease activity upon DNIC treatment, with an IC50 of 38 +/- 2 muM for TGTA-RRE and 33 +/- 2 muM for TG-RRE. This study presents a simple computational method for predicting DNIC-protein interactions; the in vitro study is consistent with in silico leads.	Mechanism;Treatment
34205133	Symptom and Age Homophilies in SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Networks during the Early Phase of the Pandemic in Japan. Kanagawa and Hokkaido were affected by COVID-19 in the early stage of the pandemic. Japan's initial response included contact tracing and PCR analysis on anyone who was suspected of having been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. In this retrospective study, we analyzed publicly available COVID-19 registry data from Kanagawa and Hokkaido (n = 4392). Exponential random graph model (ERGM) network analysis was performed to examine demographic and symptomological homophilies. Age, symptomatic, and asymptomatic status homophilies were seen in both prefectures. Symptom homophilies suggest that nuanced genetic differences in the virus may affect its epithelial cell type range and can result in the diversity of symptoms seen in individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2. Environmental variables such as temperature and humidity may also play a role in the overall pathogenesis of the virus. A higher level of asymptomatic transmission was observed in Kanagawa. Moreover, patients who contracted the virus through secondary or tertiary contacts were shown to be asymptomatic more frequently than those who contracted it from primary cases. Additionally, most of the transmissions stopped at the primary and secondary levels. As expected, significant viral transmission was seen in healthcare settings.	Transmission
34282072	Through Their Eyes: Health Care Worker Compliance With Personal Protective Equipment During the COVID-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) plays a critical role in protecting health care workers (HCWs). During the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, shortages of PPE supplies drastically changed the way PPE was obtained and used by HCWs. PURPOSE: The objective was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and patient isolation type on PPE compliance. METHODS: This investigation was a survey of HCWs at a level 1 trauma teaching hospital regarding PPE compliance patterns prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: HCWs reported an increase in PPE compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half (48.6%) of respondents reported that isolation type impacted the decision to wear PPE, of which most were likely to forgo PPE with contact precautions. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs identified multiple barriers to compliance. The underutilization of PPE with contact precautions suggests that the risk of exposure is interpreted as low, and this could be a future target of education.	Prevention
34348897	Effect of BCG vaccination on proinflammatory responses in elderly individuals. We investigated the influence of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination on the unstimulated plasma levels of a wide panel of cytokines, chemokines, acute-phase proteins (APPs), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and growth factors in a group of healthy elderly individuals (age, 60 to 80 years) at baseline (before vaccination) and 1 month after vaccination as part of our clinical study to examine the effect of BCG on COVID-19. Our results demonstrated that BCG vaccination resulted in diminished plasma levels of types 1, 2, and 17 and other proinflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferons. BCG vaccination also resulted in decreased plasma levels of CC, CXC chemokines, APPs, MMPs, and growth factors. Plasma levels of the aforementioned parameters were significantly lower in vaccinated individuals when compared to unvaccinated control individuals. Thus, our study demonstrates the immunomodulatory properties of BCG vaccination and suggests its potential utility in nonspecific vaccination of COVID-19 by down-modulating pathogenic inflammatory responses.

34221871	Can remdesivir and its parent nucleoside GS-441524 be potential oral drugs? An in vitro and in vivo DMPK assessment. Remdesivir (RDV) is the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for treating COVID-19. However, RDV can only be given by intravenous route, and there is a pressing medical need for oral antivirals. Significant evidence suggests that the role of the parent nucleoside GS-441524 in the clinical outcomes of RDV could be largely underestimated. We performed an in vitro and in vivo drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) assessment to examine the potential of RDV, and particularly GS-441524, as oral drugs. In our in vitro assessments, RDV exhibited prohibitively low stability in human liver microsomes (HLMs, t 1/2 = approximately 1 min), with the primary CYP-mediated metabolism being the mono-oxidation likely on the phosphoramidate moiety. This observation is poorly aligned with any potential oral use of RDV, though in the presence of cobicistat, the microsomal stability was drastically boosted to the level observed without enzyme cofactor NADPH. Conversely, GS-441524 showed excellent metabolic stability in human plasma and HLMs. In further in vivo studies in CD-1 mice, GS-441524 displayed a favorable oral bioavailability of 57%. Importantly, GS-441524 produced adequate drug exposure in the mice plasma and lung, and was effectively converted to the active triphosphate, suggesting that it could be a promising oral antiviral drug for treating COVID-19.

34201285	"Modelling Voluntary General Population Vaccination Strategies during COVID-19 Outbreak: Influence of Disease Prevalence. A novel statistical model based on a two-layer, contact and information, graph is suggested in order to study the influence of disease prevalence on voluntary general population vaccination during the COVID-19 outbreak. Details about the structure and number of susceptible, infectious, and recovered/vaccinated individuals from the contact layer are simultaneously transferred to the information layer. The ever-growing wealth of information that is becoming available about the COVID virus was modelled at each individual level by a simplified proxy predictor of the amount of disease spread. Each informed individual, a node in a heterogeneous graph, makes a decision about vaccination ""motivated"" by their benefit. The obtained results showed that disease information type, global or local, has a significant impact on an individual vaccination decision. A number of different scenarios were investigated. The scenarios showed that in the case of the stronger impact of globally broadcasted disease information, individuals tend to vaccinate in larger numbers at the same time when the infection has already spread within the population. If individuals make vaccination decisions based on locally available information, the vaccination rate is uniformly spread during infection outbreak duration. Prioritising elderly population vaccination leads to an increased number of infected cases and a higher reduction in mortality. The developed model accuracy allows the precise targeting of vaccination order depending on the individuals' number of social contacts. Precisely targeted vaccination, combined with pre-existing immunity, and public health measures can limit the infection to isolated hotspots inside the population, as well as significantly delay and lower the infection peak."

34200570	Liver Impairment and Hematological Changes in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C and COVID-19: A Retrospective Study after One Year of Pandemic. Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing public health emergency. Patients with chronic diseases are at greater risk for complications and poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to investigate the liver function abnormalities and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and chronic hepatitis C. Materials and Methods: This retrospective, single-center study was conducted on a cohort of 126 patients with a history of hepatitis C, confirmed with COVID-19 between 01 April 2020 and 30 December 2020. Several clinical outcomes were compared between patients with active and non-active HCV infection, and the risks of liver impairment and all-cause mortality in active HCV patients were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: Among 1057 patients under follow-up for chronic HCV infection, 126 (11.9%) were confirmed with COVID-19; of these, 95 (75.4%) were under treatment or achieved SVR, while in the other 31 (24.6%), we found active HCV replication. There was a significantly higher proportion of severe COVID-19 cases in the active HCV group as compared to the non-active HCV group (32.2 vs. 7.3%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that age, sex, alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and HCV viral load were significant independent risk factors for liver impairment and all-cause mortality. The length of stay in hospital and intensive care unit for COVID-19 was significantly higher in patients with active HCV infection (p-value < 0.001), and a higher proportion of these patients required mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: Active HCV infection is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34222271	Abnormal Coagulation Function of Patients With COVID-19 Is Significantly Related to Hypocalcemia and Severe Inflammation. This study aimed to detect, analyze, and correlate the clinical characteristics, blood coagulation functions, blood calcium levels, and inflammatory factors in patients with mild and severe COVID-19 infections. The enrolled COVID-19 infected patients were from Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital (17 cases, Wuhan, China), Suzhou Infectious Disease Hospital (87 cases, Suzhou, China), and Xuzhou Infectious Disease Hospital (14 cases, Xuzhou, China). After admission, basic information was collected; X-ray and chest CT images were obtained; and data from routine blood tests, liver and kidney function, myocardial enzymes, electrolytes, blood coagulation function, (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, procalcitonin (PCT), calcitonin, and other laboratory tests were obtained. The patients were grouped according to the clinical classification method based on the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan for new coronavirus infection (trial version 7) in China. The measurements from mild (56 cases) and severe cases (51 cases) were compared and analyzed. Most COVID-19 patients presented with fever. Chest X-ray and CT images showed multiple patchy and ground glass opacities in the lungs of COVID 19 infected patients, especially in patients with severe cases. Compared with patients with mild infection, patients with severe infection were older (p = 0.023) and had a significant increase in AST and BUN. The levels of CK, LDH, CK-MB, proBNP, and Myo in patients with severe COVID-19 infection were also increased significantly compared to those in patients with mild cases. Patients with severe COVID-19 infections presented coagulation dysfunction and increased D-dimer and fibrin degradation product (FDP) levels. Severe COVID-19 patients had low serum calcium ion (Ca(2+)) concentrations and high calcitonin and PCT levels and exhibited serious systemic inflammation. Ca(2+) in COVID-19 patients was significantly negatively correlated with PCT, calcitonin, D-dimer, PFDP, ESR, CRP and IL-6. D-dimer in COVID-19 patients was a significantly positively correlated with CRP and IL-6. In conclusion, patients with severe COVID-19 infection presented significant metabolic dysfunction and abnormal blood coagulation, a sharp increase in inflammatory factors and calcitonin and procalcitonin levels, and a significant decrease in Ca(2+). Decreased Ca(2+) and coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19 patients were significantly correlated with each other and with inflammatory factors.	Diagnosis
34220520	The Role and Mechanism of Histone Deacetylases in Acute Kidney Injury. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical complication with an incidence of up to 8-18% in hospitalized patients. AKI is also a complication of COVID-19 patients and is associated with an increased risk of death. In recent years, numerous studies have suggested that epigenetic regulation is critically involved in the pathophysiological process and prognosis of AKI. Histone acetylation, one of the epigenetic regulations, is negatively regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Increasing evidence indicates that HDACs play an important role in the pathophysiological development of AKI by regulation of apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, fibrosis, cell survival, autophagy, ATP production, and mitochondrial biogenesis (MB). In this review, we summarize and discuss the role and mechanism of HDACs in the pathogenesis of AKI.	Mechanism;Treatment
34291224	Six-Month Pulmonary Function After Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients. OBJECTIVES: Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been largely used in patients with refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019. Few data on long-term pulmonary function among venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivors are available. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational cohort. SETTING: Two mixed medical-surgical tertiary (30 beds) and secondary (22 beds) ICUs. PATIENTS: All critically ill adult coronavirus disease 2019 survivors treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between March 10, and April 30, 2020. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The last available lung function and 6-minute walking tests, performed after a median of 178 days (ranges, 72-232 d) from ICU admission, were analyzed. Among the 32 coronavirus disease 2019 patients treated by venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the study period, 11 (34%; median age 56 yr; median duration of mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy of 26 and 15 d, respectively) were successfully weaned and discharged home. Spirometry was performed in nine patients; the volumetric lung function was preserved, that is, median forced vital capacity was 83% of predicted value (51-99% of predicted value), and median forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 82% of predicted value (60-99% of predicted value). Also, the median residual volume and the lung capacity were 100% of predicted value (50-140% of predicted value) and 90% of predicted value (50-100% of predicted value); only the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide and 6-minute walking test were decreased (58% of predicted value [37-95% of predicted value] and 468 meters (365-625 meters), corresponding to [63-90% of predicted value], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Among survivors from severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, preserved long-term volumetric lung function with decreased diffusion capacity of lung carbon monoxide was observed.

34225774	The relationship between time to a high COVID-19 response level and timing of peak daily incidence: an analysis of governments' Stringency Index from 148 countries. BACKGROUND: The transmission dynamics and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is different across countries or regions. Differences in governments' policy responses may explain some of these differences. We aimed to compare worldwide government responses to the spread of COVID-19, to examine the relationship between response level, response timing and the epidemic trajectory. METHODS: Free publicly-accessible data collected by the Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) were used. Nine sub-indicators reflecting government response from 148 countries were collected systematically from January 1 to May 1, 2020. The sub-indicators were scored and were aggregated into a common Stringency Index (SI, a value between 0 and 100) that reflects the overall stringency of the government's response in a daily basis. Group-based trajectory modelling method was used to identify trajectories of SI. Multivariable linear regression models were used to analyse the association between time to reach a high-level SI and time to the peak number of daily new cases. RESULTS: Our results identified four trajectories of response in the spread of COVID-19 based on when the response was initiated: before January 13, from January 13 to February 12, from February 12 to March 11, and the last stage-from March 11 (the day WHO declared a pandemic of COVID-19) on going. Governments' responses were upgraded with further spread of COVID-19 but varied substantially across countries. After the adjustment of SI level, geographical region and initiation stages, each day earlier to a high SI level (SI > 80) from the start of response was associated with 0.44 (standard error: 0.08, P < 0.001, R(2) = 0.65) days earlier to the peak number of daily new case. Also, each day earlier to a high SI level from the date of first reported case was associated with 0.65 (standard error: 0.08, P < 0.001, R(2) = 0.42) days earlier to the peak number of daily new case. CONCLUSIONS: Early start of a high-level response to COVID-19 is associated with early arrival of the peak number of daily new cases. This may help to reduce the delays in flattening the epidemic curve to the low spread level.	Prevention
34341120	Pairing facts with imagined consequences improves pandemic-related risk perception. The COVID-19 pandemic reached staggering new peaks during a global resurgence more than a year after the crisis began. Although public health guidelines initially helped to slow the spread of disease, widespread pandemic fatigue and prolonged harm to financial stability and mental well-being contributed to this resurgence. In the late stage of the pandemic, it became clear that new interventions were needed to support long-term behavior change. Here, we examined subjective perceived risk about COVID-19 and the relationship between perceived risk and engagement in risky behaviors. In study 1 (n = 303), we found that subjective perceived risk was likely inaccurate but predicted compliance with public health guidelines. In study 2 (n = 735), we developed a multifaceted intervention designed to realign perceived risk with actual risk. Participants completed an episodic simulation task; we expected that imagining a COVID-related scenario would increase the salience of risk information and enhance behavior change. Immediately following the episodic simulation, participants completed a risk estimation task with individualized feedback about local viral prevalence. We found that information prediction error, a measure of surprise, drove beneficial change in perceived risk and willingness to engage in risky activities. Imagining a COVID-related scenario beforehand enhanced the effect of prediction error on learning. Importantly, our intervention produced lasting effects that persisted after a 1- to 3-wk delay. Overall, we describe a fast and feasible online intervention that effectively changed beliefs and intentions about risky behaviors.	Prevention
34203545	A Case of COVID-19 Pregnancy Complicated with Hydrops Fetalis and Intrauterine Death. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly evolved into a worldwide pandemic causing a serious global public health problem. The risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still debated, and the consequences of this virus on pregnant women and their fetuses remain unknown. We report a case of pregnancy complicated with hydrops fetalis that developed 7 weeks after recovery from a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to intrauterine death of the foetus. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 placentitis was demonstrated by the presence of viral particles in the placenta identified by immunohistochemistry. As we excluded all possible etiological factors for non-immunologic hydrops fetalis, we believe that the fetal consequences of our case are related to vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second reported case in the literature of COVID-19 infection complicated with hydrops fetalis and intrauterine fetal demise.	Case Report
34202565	The Antiviral Effect of the Chemical Compounds Targeting DED/EDh Motifs of the Viral Proteins on Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus and SARS-CoV-2. Arenaviruses and coronaviruses include several human pathogenic viruses, such as Lassa virus, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Although these viruses belong to different virus families, they possess a common motif, the DED/EDh motif, known as an exonuclease (ExoN) motif. In this study, proof-of-concept studies, in which the DED/EDh motif in these viral proteins, NP for arenaviruses, and nsp14 for coronaviruses, could be a drug target, were performed. Docking simulation studies between two structurally different chemical compounds, ATA and PV6R, and the DED/EDh motifs in these viral proteins indicated that these compounds target DED/EDh motifs. The concentration which exhibited modest cell toxicity was used with these compounds to treat LCMV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in two different cell lines, A549 and Vero 76 cells. Both ATA and PV6R inhibited the post-entry step of LCMV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. These studies strongly suggest that DED/EDh motifs in these viral proteins could be a drug target to combat two distinct viral families, arenaviruses and coronaviruses.	Mechanism;Treatment
34228523	"COVID-19 Is Becoming A '9/11 Moment' For Borders And Health. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on the cross-border movement of people. As governments begin to reopen their borders and cautiously restart travel, their attention is shifting to border procedures that could facilitate travel while protecting the homeland from travelers who may be infected. This is not the first time in recent memory that border management has had to be rethought under the pressure of large external forces. This article examines parallels between the current situation and the early 2000s, when the September 11, 2001, attacks on US targets caused a seismic shift in managing borders. We find echoes of today's responses in the initial fragmentation and chaos of two decades ago, which eventually gave way to a coordinated international system. We also analyze the implications of the emerging border health infrastructure for other migration challenges-particularly addressing irregular crossings and the border ""crises"" they create. Because the aftershocks of the pandemic on all aspects of people on the move could be felt for decades, immigration, mobility management, and public health priorities must be considered alongside one another."

34198858	Evidencing the Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Imposed Lockdown Measures on Fitness Status in Adolescents: A Preliminary Report. It was established that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in decreased physical activity levels, potentially leading to reduced physical fitness. The aim of this research was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on fitness indices in adolescents. We observed high school adolescents (33% girls; aged 15-17 years) divided into two cohorts. The first cohort (control; n = 48) included adolescents who were in school during the 2018/2019 year, while the second cohort (lockdown; n = 66) was observed during the school year 2019/2020 when COVID-19 lockdown measures were imposed. Variables included body height, body mass, BMI, sit-ups, and the 600 m dash. Both cohorts were tested at the beginning and at the end of the observed school years. A factorial analysis of variance for repeated measurements evidenced an improvement in sit-ups and the 600 m dash in the control, and a decrease of the same capacities in the lockdown cohort. In the lockdown cohort, a decrease in muscular fitness was more evident in boys than in girls. No differential changes between cohorts were evidenced in anthropometrics. Results suggest that the COVID-19 lockdown negatively influenced muscular fitness status in adolescents, especially in boys.	Prevention
34204256	Antiviral Activity of Two Marine Carotenoids against SARS-CoV-2 Virus Entry In Silico and In Vitro. The marine carotenoids fucoxanthin and siphonaxanthin are powerful antioxidants that are attracting focused attention to identify a variety of health benefits and industry applications. In this study, the binding energy of these carotenoids with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-glycoprotein was predicted by molecular docking simulation, and their inhibitory activity was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus on HEK293 cells overexpressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Siphonaxanthin from Codium fragile showed significant antiviral activity with an IC50 of 87.4 muM against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry, while fucoxanthin from Undaria pinnatifida sporophyll did not. The acute toxicities were predicted to be relatively low, and pharmacokinetic predictions indicate GI absorption. Although further studies are needed to elucidate the inhibition of viral infection by siphonaxanthin, these results provide useful information in the application of these marine carotenoids for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.

34210735	Factors influencing the willingness of primary care physicians to provide care during the coronavirus disease pandemic: a nationwide survey in Taiwan. OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to advance worldwide with tremendous impact on public health, economy and society. Primary healthcare is crucial in every country during the pandemic for an integrated and coordinated healthcare delivery system; hence, it is of paramount importance to maintain a sufficient frontline workforce. This study aimed to identify factors influencing the willingness of primary care physicians to provide care during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross sectional study. SETTING: Nationwide survey PARTICIPANTS: Primary care physicians working in the community in Taiwan were selected using a cluster sampling method based on practice region from May to June 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: The willingness of primary care physicians to provide care during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: This study surveyed 1000 primary care physicians nationwide, and 625 valid questionnaires were received and included in the final analysis, with an effective response rate of 62.5%. Factors significantly associated with physicians willingness to provide care during COVID-19 were 'joining the Community Healthcare Group (CHCG)' (p<0.001), 'perceived more overall benefits for providing care' (p<0.001) 'perceived less overall barriers to providing care' (p<0.001), 'higher knowledge scores about COVID-19' (p=0.049) and 'physician's major specialties' (p=0.009) in the multivariate logistic regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Building a comprehensive primary care system such as Taiwan's CHCG, training of more family physicians or general practitioners, and protecting and supporting primary care physicians were important in response to infectious disease pandemics. The findings of this study inform the development of guidelines to support and maintain the primary healthcare workforces during the COVID-19 pandemic and for future events.	Prevention
34290613	Targeting SARS-CoV-2-Platelet Interactions in COVID-19 and Vaccine-Related Thrombosis. It is clear that COVID-19 is more than a pneumonia and is associated with a coagulopathy and multi-organ failure. While the use of anti-coagulants does reduce the incidence of pulmonary emboli, it does not help with survival. This suggests that the coagulopathy is more likely to be platelet-driven rather than thrombin-driven. There is significant evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 virions directly interact with platelets to trigger activation leading to thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. I propose a model of multiple interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and platelets that has many similarities to that with Staphylococcus aureus and Dengue virus. As platelet activation and thrombosis are major factors in poor prognosis, therapeutics that target the platelet-SARS-CoV-2 interaction have potential in treating COVID-19 and other virus infections.

34339241	Evidence Of Respiratory Infection Transmission Within Physician Offices Could Inform Outpatient Infection Control. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatient clinics throughout the US shifted toward virtual care to limit viral transmission in the office. However, as health care facilities have reopened, evidence about the risk of acquiring respiratory viral infections in medical office settings remains limited. To inform policy for reopening outpatient care settings, we analyzed rates of potential airborne disease transmission in medical office settings, focusing on influenza-like illness. We quantified whether exposed patients (that is, those seen in a medical office after a patient with influenza-like illness) were more likely to return with a similar illness in the next two weeks compared with nonexposed patients seen earlier in the day. Patients exposed to influenza-like illness in the medical office setting were more likely than nonexposed patients to revisit with a similar illness within two weeks (adjusted absolute difference: 0.7 per 1,000 patients). Similar patterns were not observed for exposure to urinary tract infection and back pain as noncontagious control conditions. These results highlight the potential threat of reopening outpatient clinics during the pandemic and the value of virtual visits for patients with suspected respiratory infections.

34218010	Progress and pitfalls of a year of drug repurposing screens against COVID-19. Near the end of 2019, a new betacoronavirus started to efficiently transmit between humans, resulting in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Unprecedented worldwide efforts were made to identify and repurpose antiviral therapeutics from collections of approved drugs and known bioactive compounds. Typical pitfalls of this approach (promiscuous/cytotoxic compounds leading to false positives), combined with bypassing antiviral drug development parameters due to urgency have resulted in often disappointing outcomes. A flood of publications, press-releases, and media posts, created confusion in the general public and sometime mobilized precious resources for clinical trials with minimal prospect of success. Breakthroughs have been made, not in the laboratory but in the clinic, resulting from the empiric identification of mitigators of clinical signs such as the discovery of improved disease management through immunomodulators. This opinion piece will aim to capture some of the lessons that we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has taught about drug repurposing screens.	Treatment
34281387	Evolutionary Tracking of SARS-CoV-2 Genetic Variants Highlights an Intricate Balance of Stabilizing and Destabilizing Mutations. The currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has accounted for millions of infections and deaths across the globe. Genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are being published daily in public databases and the availability of these genome data sets has allowed unprecedented access to the mutational patterns of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. We made use of the same genomic information for conducting phylogenetic analysis and identifying lineage-specific mutations. The catalogued lineage-defining mutations were analyzed for their stabilizing or destabilizing impact on viral proteins. We recorded persistence of D614G, S477N, A222V, and V1176F variants and a global expansion of the PANGOLIN variant B.1. In addition, a retention of Q57H (B.1.X), R203K/G204R (B.1.1.X), T85I (B.1.2-B.1.3), G15S+T428I (C.X), and I120F (D.X) variations was observed. Overall, we recorded a striking balance between stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, therefore leading to well-maintained protein structures. With selection pressures in the form of newly developed vaccines and therapeutics to mount in the coming months, the task of mapping viral mutations and recording their impact on key viral proteins should be crucial to preemptively catch any escape mechanism for which SARS-CoV-2 may evolve. IMPORTANCE Since its initial isolation in Wuhan, China, large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been shared in publicly accessible repositories, thus enabling scientists to do detailed evolutionary analysis. We investigated the evolutionarily associated mutational diversity overlaid on the major phylogenetic lineages circulating globally, using 513 representative genomes. We detailed the phylogenetic persistence of key variants facilitating global expansion of the PANGOLIN variant B.1, including the recent, fast-expanding, B.1.1.7 lineage. The stabilizing or destabilizing impact of the catalogued lineage-defining mutations on viral proteins indicates their possible involvement in balancing the protein function and structure. A clear understanding of this mutational profile is of high clinical significance to catch any vaccine escape mechanism, as the same proteins make crucial components of vaccines that have recently been approved or are in development. In this vein, our study provides an imperative framework and baseline data upon which further analysis could be built as newer variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to appear.	Mechanism
34362259	COVID-19 and oncological disease. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory tract infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, initially emerged in China in late 2019. The rapid global spread of this novel virus led the World Health Organization declare a pandemic with &gt; 30,000,000 confirmed cases, 946,000 deaths and &gt; 21,000,000 recoveries reported as of 18 September 2020, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Initial reports from Asia suggested that elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, specifically diabetes, hypertension, and obesity were at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. As data on these risks have evolved, evidence has increasingly shown that patients with cancer are indeed a particularly vulnerable group. However, the effects of various confounding factors, including an older than average patient population who often have underlying comorbidities including a suppressed immune system and/&#8202;or a hypercoagulable state, have been difficult to separate from the effects of having cancer. Common presenting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 including dyspnoea, cough, fever, fatigue, dysgeusia and, less commonly, diarrhoea and/&#8202;or a hyperinflammatory syndrome are equally confusing to clinicians as they all are common symptoms of both cancer and toxicity from anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, the radiographic dilemma of distinguishing between immune-checkpoint inhibitor-induced pneumonitis from that caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and conflicting data on the effects of certain therapies on patient outcomes has left clinicians with considerable angst on how to help patients with acute or worsening symptoms in an optimal way. Predicted increase in mortality follows not only from the delay in discovery and progress resulting from temporary closing of research laboratories at cancer centers but also from diversion of resources to patient care and temporary suspension of clinical trial enrolment both by companies and local institutions. The possibilities of travelling to specialized medical centers whose activities are essential for the delivery and improvement of patient care were reduced, too. Viral mutations might also occur during transmission and spread; this leads to a statement that SARS-CoV-2 will forever remain a looming threat to the oncological community. What is crucial to remember is that cancer itself is a pandemic with &gt; 18,000,000 people dia-gnosed worldwide every year. Many societies, including the European Society for Medical Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, are providing clinical recommendations for the management of patients with cancer during this challenging time, recognizing that continuation in the precise treatment of our patients is critical for our role of physicians. PURPOSE: The aim of the presentation is to point out the contact or overlapping areas of both mentioned disease entities for the purpose of possible simplification of dia-gnostic and therapeutic management of a cancer patient with suspected or already proven COVID-19 disease.

34353107	"Liver injury in COVID-19 patients with metabolic syndrome-a narrative review. OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively analyze that how liver injury in patients with metabolic syndrome is affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and provide clinical reference to their prevention and treatment. BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic poses a major threat to human life and health. Metabolic syndrome is also a major global health problem, and evidence suggests that patients with metabolic syndrome are at an increased risk of COVID-19 complications. Liver injury is one of the main manifestations of extra-pulmonary organ injury in patients with COVID-19. Currently, the effects of metabolic syndrome on liver injury in patients with COVID-19 are unclear. METHODS: In this study, we searched the PubMed, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases for articles on the latest developments of liver injury in COVID-19 patients with metabolic syndrome from 2019 to comprehensively analyze the current knowledge of how liver injury in patients with metabolic syndrome is affected by COVID-19. We used the free key words ""metabolic syndrome"" OR ""hypertension"" OR ""obesity"" OR ""diabetes"" OR ""dyslipidemia"" OR ""liver injury"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" OR ""COVID-19"" in all fields. We imposed no language restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: Both COVID-19 and metabolic syndrome and its components are closely related to liver injury, may induce liver injury through direct or indirect mechanisms. Therefore, when COVID-19 is combined with metabolic syndrome, it may increase the risk of liver injury, and it cannot be ruled out that the two diseases have a superimposed effect on liver injury."

34205018	Infectious Respiratory Diseases Decreased during the COVID-19 Pandemic in South Korea. Infectious respiratory diseases are highly contagious and very common, and thus can be considered as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We followed up the incidence rates (IRs) of eight infectious respiratory diseases, including chickenpox, measles, pertussis, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease, scarlet fever, rubella, and meningococcal disease, after COVID-19 mitigation measures were implemented in South Korea, and then compared those with the IRs in the corresponding periods in the previous 3 years. Overall, the IRs of these diseases before and after age- or sex-standardization significantly decreased in the intervention period compared with the pre-intervention periods (p < 0.05 for all eight diseases). However, the difference in the IRs of all eight diseases between the IRs before and after age-standardization was significant (p < 0.05 for all periods), while it was not significant with regard to sex-standardization. The incidence rate ratios for eight diseases in the pre-intervention period compared with the intervention period ranged from 3.1 to 4.1. These results showed the positive effects of the mitigation measures on preventing the development of respiratory infectious diseases, regardless of age or sex, but we need to consider the age-structure of the population to calculate the effect size. In the future, some of these measures could be applied nationwide to prevent the occurrence or to reduce the transmission during outbreaks of these infections. This study provides evidence for strengthening the infectious disease management policies in South Korea.	Prevention
34199203	Gut Dysbiosis and IL-21 Response in Patients with Severe COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The disease severity, ranging from being asymptomatic to having acute illness, and associated inflammatory responses has suggested that alterations in the gut microbiota may play a crucial role in the development of chronic disorders due to COVID-19 infection. This study describes gut microbiota dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients and its implications relating to the disease. DESIGN: A cross sectional prospective study was performed on thirty RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, India, between September 10 and 20, 2020. Ten healthy volunteers were recruited as the control group. IFN, TNF, and IL-21 profiling was conducted using plasma samples, and gut bacterial analysis was performed after obtaining the metagenomics data of stool samples. RESULTS: Patients with a variable COVID-19 severity showed distinct gut microflora and peripheral interleukin-21 levels. A low Firmicute/Bacteroidetes ratio, caused by the depletion of the fibre-utilizing bacteria, F. prausnitzii, B. Plebius, and Prevotella, and an increase in Bacteroidetes has associated gut microbiota dysbiosis with COVID-19 disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The loss of the functional attributes of signature commensals in the gut, due to dysbiosis, is a predisposing factor of COVID-19 pathophysiology.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
34228144	"[Viral infections in urology]. INTRODUCTION: The COVID (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has shown impressively that infectious diseases can have an enormous impact on the healthcare system and beyond. In the specialty of urology, patients present in daily practice with viral infections that are associated with numerous diseases. METHODOLOGY: The aim of this review is to describe viral infections relevant for urology, and in particular to emphasize vaccination prevention. A selective literature search was carried out on the subjects of ""COVID and urology"", ""urogenital viral infections"", ""viral urological infections in transplant medicine"", and ""vaccination prevention of viral diseases"". RESULTS: Coronaviruses have already caused two local epidemics: SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) epidemic. The fact that the SARS-CoV2 (SARS coronavirus 2) disease is contagious even without symptoms has essentially led to the rapid spread and global pandemic. A large number of viruses, which can also induce viremia, have been detected in the ejaculate and are thus associated with a possible urogenital infection. These include the mumps virus, Coxsackie viruses or enteroviruses, among others. It has also been shown that a Zika virus infection can also be sexually transmitted via the sperm as a carrier. Viruses therefore also play an important role in reproduction. When performing kidney transplants, urologists are often confronted with viral infections. The most effective weapon against viruses is prevention by vaccination. CONCLUSION: In terms of ethiopathogenesis, the genitourinary tract is most often affected by viruses, in the context of viremia or through reactivation due to immunosuppression. Immunomodulation and vaccination prophylaxis play a leading role in therapy."	Transmission;Treatment;Prevention
34282358	Targeting TLR4 Signaling to Blunt Viral-Mediated Acute Lung Injury. Respiratory viral infections have been a long-standing global burden ranging from seasonal recurrences to the unexpected pandemics. The yearly hospitalizations from seasonal viruses such as influenza can fluctuate greatly depending on the circulating strain(s) and the congruency with the predicted strains used for the yearly vaccine formulation, which often are not predicted accurately. While antiviral agents are available against influenza, efficacy is limited due to a temporal disconnect between the time of infection and symptom development and viral resistance. Uncontrolled, influenza infections can lead to a severe inflammatory response initiated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or host-derived danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that ultimately signal through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Overall, these pathogen-host interactions result in a local cytokine storm leading to acute lung injury (ALI) or the more severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with concomitant systemic involvement and more severe, life threatening consequences. In addition to traditional antiviral treatments, blocking the host's innate immune response may provide a more viable approach to combat these infectious pathogens. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic illustrates a critical need for novel treatments to counteract the ALI and ARDS that has caused the deaths of millions worldwide. This review will examine how antagonizing TLR4 signaling has been effective experimentally in ameliorating ALI and lethal infection in challenge models triggered not only by influenza, but also by other ALI-inducing viruses.

34213965	First Report of Fusarium asiaticum Causing Stem Rot of Ligusticum chuanxiong in China. Ligusticum chuanxiong (known as Chuanxiong in China) is a traditional edible-medicinal herb, which has been playing important roles in fighting against COVID-19 (Ma et al. 2020). In March 2021, we investigated stem rot of Chuanxiong in six adjacent fields (~100 ha) in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China. The disease incidence was above 5% in each field. Symptomatic plants showed stem rot, watersoaked lesions, and blackening with white hyphae present on the stems. Twelve symptomatic Chuanxiong plants (2 plants/field) were sampled. Diseased tissues from the margins of necrotic lesions were surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 45 s, and 2% NaClO for 5 min. Samples were then rinsed three times in sterile distilled water and cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25 masculineC for 72 h. Fourteen fungal cultures were isolated from 18 diseased tissues, of which eight monosporic isolates showed uniform characteristics. The eight fungal isolates showed fluffy white aerial mycelia and produced yellow pigments with age. Mung bean broth was used to induce sporulation. Macroconidia were sickle-shaped, slender, 3- to 5-septate, and averaged 50 to 70 mum in length. Based on morphological features of colonies and conidia, the isolates were tentatively identified as Fusarium spp. (Leslie and Summerell 2006). To identify the species, the partial translation elongation factor 1 alpha (TEF1-alpha) gene was amplified and sequenced (O'Donnell et al. 1998). TEF1-alpha sequences of LCSR01, LCSR02 and LCSR05 isolates (GenBank nos. MZ169386, MZ169388 and MZ169387) were 100%, 99.72% and 99.86% identical to that of F. asiaticum strain NRRL 26156, respectively. The phylogenetic tree based on TEF1-alpha sequences showed these isolates clustered with F. asiaticum using Neighbor-Joining algorithm. Furthermore, these isolates were identified using the specific primer pair Fg16 F/R (Nicholson et al. 1998). The results showed these isolates (GenBank nos. MZ164938, MZ164939 and MZ164940) were 100% identical to F. asiaticum NRRL 26156. Pathogenicity test of the isolate LCSR01 was conducted on Chuanxiong. After wounding Chuanxiong stalks and rhizomes with a sterile needle, the wounds were inoculated with mycelia PDA plugs. A total of 30 Chuanxiong rhizomes and stalks were inoculated with mycelia PDA plugs, and five mock-inoculated Chuanxiong rhizomes and stalks served as controls. After inoculation, the stalks and rhizomes were kept in a moist chamber at 25 degrees C in the dark. At 8 days post inoculation (dpi), all inoculated stalks and rhizomes exhibited water-soaked and blackened lesions. At 10 dpi, the stalks turned soft and decayed, and abundant hyphae grew on the exterior of infected plants, similar to those observed in the field. No disease symptoms were observed on the control plants. The pathogen was re-isolated from the inoculated tissues and the identity was confirmed as described above. Ten fungal cultures were re-isolated from the 10 inoculated tissues, of which nine fungal cultures were F. asiaticum, fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. asiaticum causing stem rot of Chuanxiong in China. Chuanxiong has been cultivated in rotation with rice over multiple years. This rotation may have played a role in the increase in inoculum density in soil and stem rot epidemics in Chuanxiong. Diseased Chuanxiong may be contaminated with the mycotoxins produced by F. asciaticum, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol or nivalenol, which may deleteriously affect human health. Therefore, crop rotations should be considered carefully to reduce disease impacts.	Mechanism;Treatment
34223954	Artificial intelligence for prediction of COVID-19 progression using CT imaging and clinical data. OBJECTIVES: Early recognition of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity can guide patient management. However, it is challenging to predict when COVID-19 patients will progress to critical illness. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence system to predict future deterioration to critical illness in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: An artificial intelligence (AI) system in a time-to-event analysis framework was developed to integrate chest CT and clinical data for risk prediction of future deterioration to critical illness in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A multi-institutional international cohort of 1,051 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and chest CT was included in this study. Of them, 282 patients developed critical illness, which was defined as requiring ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation and/or reaching death during their hospital stay. The AI system achieved a C-index of 0.80 for predicting individual COVID-19 patients' to critical illness. The AI system successfully stratified the patients into high-risk and low-risk groups with distinct progression risks (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Using CT imaging and clinical data, the AI system successfully predicted time to critical illness for individual patients and identified patients with high risk. AI has the potential to accurately triage patients and facilitate personalized treatment. KEY POINT: * AI system can predict time to critical illness for patients with COVID-19 by using CT imaging and clinical data.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34285749	Neurological manifestations in patients with symptomatic COVID-19 admitted to the Bafoussam Regional Hospital, Cameroon. Introduction: although the main manifestations of COVID-19 are respiratory, several neurological symptoms and complications have also been reported. The pandemic seems to have some epidemiological specificities in sub-Saharan Africa, and this may be reflected in the type and frequency of neurological symptoms. This study aimed to report neurological manifestations associated with symptomatic COVID-19 in a sub-Saharan African setting. Methods: we conducted a retrospective review of symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to the Bafoussam Regional Hospital between March and September 2020. Patients' files were reviewed at discharge by a consultant neurologist. Socio-demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, symptoms on admission, neurological symptoms during hospitalization, management, and in-hospital outcome were recorded. Comparisons between patients with and without neurological symptoms were performed using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: we enrolled 177 symptomatic patients (68% men). Mean age was 54.6 +/- 17.8 years (range 2-99 years). Co-morbidities were present in 57.6% of patients, including hypertension (27.1%) and diabetes mellitus (25.4%). Neurological symptoms were found in 113 (63.8%) patients. The most frequent were headache (39.0%), myalgia (35.6%), anosmia (11.9%), impaired consciousness (10.7%) and delirium (5.6%). Regarding the presenting symptoms, fever was more frequent in patients with neurological symptoms than in those without (81.4% versus 50.0%, p< 0.001), while digestive symptoms were less frequent in patients with neurological symptoms (0.9% versus 9.4%, p= 0.004). Conclusion: neurological manifestations are frequent and heterogeneous in patients with symptomatic COVID-19. Further studies are needed to clarify the pathophysiology of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 and their impact on patients' long-term outcome.	Diagnosis
34226901	In-hospital mortality in SARS-CoV-2 stratified by hemoglobin levels: A retrospective study. This study is to estimate in-hospital mortality in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients stratified by hemoglobin (Hb) level. Patients were stratified according to hemoglobin level into two groups, that is, Hb <100 g/L and Hb >100 g/L. A total of 6931 patients were included. Of these, 6377 (92%) patients had hemoglobin levels >100 g/L. The mean age was 44 +/- 17 years, and 66% of the patients were males. The median length of overall hospital stay was 13 days [2; 31]. The remaining 554 (8%) patients had a hemoglobin level <100 g/L. Overall mortality was 176 patients (2.54%) but was significantly higher in the group with hemoglobin levels <100 g/L (124, 22.4%) than in the group with hemoglobin levels >100 g/L (52, 0.82%). Risk factors associated with increased mortality were determined by multivariate analysis. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed hemoglobin as a predictor of mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression coefficients for hemoglobin for the HB </= 100 category of hemoglobin were significant, B = 2.79, SE = 0.17, and HR = 16.34, p < 0.001. Multivariate logistic regression showed Hb < 100 g/L had a higher cumulative all-cause in-hospital mortality (22.4% vs. 0.8%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.33; 95% [CI]: [0.20-0.55]; p < 0.001). In this study, hemoglobin levels <100 g/L were found to be an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34360989	The Effects of Abeta1-42 Binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein S1 Subunit and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2. Increasing evidence suggests that elderly people with dementia are vulnerable to the development of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the major form of dementia, beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels in the blood are increased; however, the impact of elevated Abeta levels on the progression of COVID-19 remains largely unknown. Here, our findings demonstrate that Abeta1-42, but not Abeta1-40, bound to various viral proteins with a preferentially high affinity for the spike protein S1 subunit (S1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). These bindings were mainly through the C-terminal residues of Abeta1-42. Furthermore, Abeta1-42 strengthened the binding of the S1 of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 and increased the viral entry and production of IL-6 in a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection model. Intriguingly, data from a surrogate mouse model with intravenous inoculation of Abeta1-42 show that the clearance of Abeta1-42 in the blood was dampened in the presence of the extracellular domain of the spike protein trimers of SARS-CoV-2, whose effects can be prevented by a novel anti-Abeta antibody. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the binding of Abeta1-42 to the S1 of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 may have a negative impact on the course and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and examine whether reducing the level of Abeta1-42 in the blood is beneficial to the fight against COVID-19 and AD.

34201422	Search for Non-Protein Protease Inhibitors Constituted with an Indole and Acetylene Core. A possible inhibitor of proteases, which contains an indole core and an aromatic polar acetylene, was designed and synthesized. This indole derivative has a molecular architecture kindred to biologically relevant species and was obtained through five synthetic steps with an overall yield of 37% from the 2,2'-(phenylazanediyl)di(ethan-1-ol). The indole derivative was evaluated through docking assays using the main protease (SARS-CoV-2-M(pro)) as a molecular target, which plays a key role in the replication process of this virus. Additionally, the indole derivative was evaluated as an inhibitor of the enzyme kallikrein 5 (KLK5), which is a serine protease that can be considered as an anticancer drug target.

34283545	[Current issues of treatment and rehabilitation of patients with neurological disorders and the consequences of COVID-19. Resolution of Advisory Board]. Last year the global medical community faced the pandemic of the new coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. To date, there is considerable expert experience, which indicates that the brain, along with the corresponding respiratory system, is a target organ for a new coronavirus infection. Moreover, a number of symptoms from the central and peripheral nervous system can persist for several weeks, months, and even tens of months. To designate such protracted clinical conditions, a new definition was introduced: <<Post-COVID-19 Condition>>. Advisory Board of Neurologists and Rehabilitation Therapists met to, discuss of practical experience and taking into account scientific information about COVID-19, which was available at the time of the meeting, to develop unified approaches for the management of patients with neurological complications and the consequences of a new coronavirus infection. The Advisory Board worked out a resolution in which formulated the tactics of managing patients with neurological manifestations of COVID-19. The substantiation of the importance and expediency of the development and implementation of a special program of clinical examination of patients who have undergone COVID-19, which would include a clinical examination with a detailed assessment of cognitive functions to early identification and diagnosis of neurodegeneration and subsequent therapy, is given.

34201519	Multidrug Resistence Prevalence in COVID Area. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is often complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome. The new coronavirus outbreak started in China in December 2019 and rapidly spread around the world. The high diffusibility of the virus was the reason for the outbreak of the pandemic viral disease, reaching more than 100 million infected people globally by the first three months of 2021. In the various treatments used up to now, the use of antimicrobial drugs for the management, especially of bacterial co-infections, is very frequent in patients admitted to intensive care. In addition, critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are subjected to prolonged mechanical ventilation and other therapeutic procedures often responsible for developing hospital co-infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria. Co-infections contribute to the increase in the morbidity-mortality of viral respiratory infections. We performed this study to review the recent articles published on the antibiotic bacterial resistance and viruses to predict risk factors of coronavirus disease 2019 and to assess the multidrug resistance in patients hospitalized in the COVID-19 area.

34281334	Compliance of children with removable functional appliance with microchip integrated during covid-19 pandemic: a systematic review. Treatments with removable appliances are widely used in Europe to correct dento-skeletal dysgnatia in the growth phase that is a period of poor cooperation of the patients. Adherence to the wear-time prescription is often not achieved and it represent the main argument against the use of removable devices. Suspected non-compliant behavior with the wear time prescription is often the subject of medico-legal disputes, which can deteriorate doctor-patient relationship. The use of microchips allows to document objectively and clarify the patient's behavior. To conduct a systematic review of the orthodontic literature to identify the factors associated with compliance in orthodontic treatment. We conduct a systematic review that aimed to identity the factors associate with compliance in orthodontic treatment. The main purpose was to assess the objective levels of time of use of the removable appliances and the self-reported levels. A literature search was conducted by the electronic databases PubMed and Cochrane Library. The following search terms were used: compliance functional removable orthodontic appliance. Randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, case series, qualitative and mixed-methods studies objectively assessing compliance levels were included in the study. A total of 94 articles were identified by PubMed and 14 articles by Cochrane. The papers selected were included for the qualitative analysis and categorized according to the subjects age, the clinical appliance, compliance factors, wear time and monitoring. Removable appliances are an important part of orthodontic treatment, used in growth phase of the patient. Collaboration with removable functional devices determines success / failure in treatment.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19, as a novel coronavirus disease caused by new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, spreads all over the world, and brings harm to human in many countries. Humans suffered a lot from both SARS-CoV-2 now and by SARS-CoV in the year 2003. It is important to understand the differences and the relationships between these two types of viruses. OBJECTIVE: To compare relative synonymous codon usage of ORF1ab gene in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, relative synonymous codon usage of their genomes are studied in this paper from the bioinformatics perspective. METHODS: The ORF1ab gene, which is an important non-structural polyprotein coding gene and now used for nucleic acid detection markers in many measurement method, in both SARS-CoV-2 (30 strains) and SARS-CoV (20 strains) are considered to be the research object in the present paper. The relative synonymous codon usage values of the ORF1ab gene are calculated to characterize the differences and the evolutionary characteristics among 50 strains. RESULTS: There is a significant difference between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 when the relative synonymous codon usage value of ORF1ab genes is concerned. The results suggest that codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV is more similar to human than that of the SARS-CoV-2, and that the inner difference in SARS-CoV-2 strains is larger than that of SARS-CoV, which denote the larger diversity exits in the SARS-CoV-2 virus. CONCLUSION: These results show that the relative synonymous codon usage values in the coronavirus could be used for further research on their evolutionary phenomenon.	Mechanism
34202092	Antiviral Activity of Metabolites from Peruvian Plants against SARS-CoV-2: An In Silico Approach. (1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic lacks treatments; for this reason, the search for potential compounds against therapeutic targets is still necessary. Bioinformatics tools have allowed the rapid in silico screening of possible new metabolite candidates from natural resources or repurposing known ones. Thus, in this work, we aimed to select phytochemical candidates from Peruvian plants with antiviral potential against three therapeutical targets of SARS-CoV-2. (2) Methods: We applied in silico technics, such as virtual screening, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and MM/GBSA estimation. (3) Results: Rutin, a compound present in Peruvian native plants, showed affinity against three targets of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated the high stability of receptor-ligand systems during the time of the simulation. Our results showed that the Mpro-Rutin system exhibited higher binding free energy than PLpro-Rutin and N-Rutin systems through MM/GBSA analysis. (4) Conclusions: Our study provides insight on natural metabolites from Peruvian plants with therapeutical potential. We found Rutin as a potential candidate with multiple pharmacological properties against SARS-CoV-2.	Mechanism;Treatment
34220185	Integration of human factors/ergonomics in healthcare systems: A giant leap in safety as a key strategy during Covid-19. In this article, we present a model for integrating Human Factors/Ergonomics (HFE) into healthcare systems to make them more robust and resilient. We believe that to increase the impact of HFE during and after the Covid-19 pandemic this integration should be carried out simultaneously at all levels (micro, meso, and macro) of the healthcare system. This new model recognizes the interrelationship between HFE and other system characteristics such as capacity, coverage, robustness, integrity, and resilience. We hope that the model will serve as a reference for a giant leap to design and improve the safety and effectiveness of healthcare services from a holistic (systems) perspective.	Prevention
34226885	Implementation of warfarin to direct oral anticoagulant conversion initiative in pharmacist-run anticoagulation clinics during COVID-19 pandemic. Due to community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), social distancing and stay-at-home orders were implemented statewide in an effort to limit the spread of disease. This posed unique challenges for patients on medications requiring close and continued monitoring by clinic staff, such as anticoagulation clinics. Thus, innovative measures were implemented at Cleveland Clinic Health System (CCHS) to maintain the health and care of ambulatory patients. An initiative to evaluate patients for warfarin to direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) conversion was used in the pharmacist-run anticoagulation clinics. This article describes how patients were screened for eligibility, the education to pharmacists, the utilization of student learners in the process, and the workflow for provider notification of conversion. Follow up monitoring, challenges encountered, and future directions are also described.	Prevention
34377166	Analysis of Ear, Nose and Throat Manifestations in COVID-19 Patients. Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has dramatically spread all over the world, crossing the borders of all countries. It is presented mainly by lower respiratory tract symptoms such as fever, cough, dyspnea, and chest tightness. However, COVID-19 causes different upper respiratory tract-related symptoms including nasal congestion, sore throat, and olfactory dysfunction. Objective To discuss different ear, nose and throat (ENT) manifestations in COVID-19-positive patients and their relation to other manifestations and to the severity of COVID-19. Methods We detected ENT manifestations in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed positive COVID-19 patients at Zagazig Isolation Hospitals (Zagazig University hospitals, Zagazig Chest hospital, Al-Ahrar hospital, and Zagazig Fever hospital) with proportional allocation in the period from April 15 to June 15, 2020. All patients were subjected to full history taking and COVID-19 was categorized into 4 classes of severity after all patients underwent computed tomography (CT) of the chest. Afterwards, the collected data was analyzed and compared. Results Among the included 120 COVID-19 patients, the most frequent reported ENT manifestations were; sore throat (30%), nasal congestion (28.3%), nasal obstruction (26.7%), sneezing (26.6%), headache (25%), smell and taste dysfunction (25%), rhinorrhea (20%), upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (15%), and tonsil enlargement (10%). The most common non-ENT manifestations were fever (88.3%), cough (63.3%), and dyspnea (45%). Conclusion Fever and cough are the dominant symptoms of COVID-19, but ENT manifestations for COVID-19 are common and should be a part of the suspected clinical criteria for COVID-19, particularly if the nasal examination was nonsignificant. The most common symptoms are sore throat, followed by nasal congestion and obstruction, headache, and lastly, olfactory dysfunction.	Diagnosis
34365699	Impact of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on the cardio-respiratory health of New Zealanders. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to health, social interaction, travel and economies worldwide. In New Zealand, the government closed the border to non-residents and required all arrivals to quarantine for 14 days. They also implemented a strict contact-restriction system to eliminate COVID-19 from the community. These measures also reduced the circulation of other respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. We assessed the impact of these measures on hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiac diseases. METHODS: National data on hospital admissions for each week of 2020 were compared to admissions for the previous 5 years. Analyses were curtailed after week 33, when a COVID-19 outbreak in Auckland led to different levels of pandemic restrictions making national data difficult to interpret. RESULTS: The numbers of acute infectious respiratory admissions were similar to previous years before the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions, but then fell lower and remained low after the pandemic restrictions were eased. The usual winter peak in respiratory admissions was not seen in 2020. Other than small reductions during the period of the strictest contact restrictions, non-infectious respiratory and cardiac admissions were similar to previous years and the usual winter peak in heart failure admissions was observed. CONCLUSION: The observed patterns of hospital admissions in 2020 are compatible with the hypothesis that circulating respiratory viruses drive the normal seasonal trends in respiratory admissions. By contrast, these findings suggest that respiratory viruses do not drive the winter peak in heart failure.	Prevention
34353886	Integrated human/SARS-CoV-2 metabolic models present novel treatment strategies against COVID-19. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently responsible for more than 3 million deaths in 219 countries across the world and with more than 140 million cases. The absence of FDA-approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted an urgent need to design new drugs. We developed an integrated model of the human cell and SARS-CoV-2 to provide insight into the virus' pathogenic mechanism and support current therapeutic strategies. We show the biochemical reactions required for the growth and general maintenance of the human cell, first, in its healthy state. We then demonstrate how the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the human cell causes biochemical and structural changes, leading to a change of cell functions or cell death. A new computational method that predicts 20 unique reactions as drug targets from our models and provides a platform for future studies on viral entry inhibition, immune regulation, and drug optimisation strategies. The model is available in BioModels (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2007210001) and the software tool, findCPcli, that implements the computational method is available at https://github.com/findCP/findCPcli.

34291074	Nutritional Impact and Its Potential Consequences on COVID-19 Severity. Background: During late 2019 a viral disease due to a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China, which rapidly developed into an exploding pandemic and poses a severe threat to human health all over the world. Until now (May 2021), there are insufficient treatment options for the management of this global disease and shortage of vaccines. Important aspects that help to defeat coronavirus infection seems to be having a healthy, strong, and resilient immune system. Nutrition and metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes play a crucial role on the community health situation in general and especially during this new pandemic. There seems to be an enormous impact of lifestyle, metabolic disorders, and immune status on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and recovery. For this reason, it is important to consider the impact of lifestyle and the consumption of well-defined healthy diets during the pandemic. Aims: In this review, we summarise recent findings on the effect of nutrition on COVID-19 susceptibility and disease severity and treatment. Understanding how specific dietary features might help to improve the public health strategies to reduce the rate and severity of COVID-19.	Treatment
34380185	Vitamin supplementation as a potential adjunctive therapeutic approach for COVID-19: biological and clinical plausibility. The recent pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has introduced itself into the human population in the 21st century after the coronavirus diseases SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). Major investigations are underway worldwide in the search for pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 and many agents are administered in off-label routes. Several cases are under study to check or restrict clinical manifestations of COVID-19. According to the fact that the efficacy of some micro-nutrients like vitamins is proven to treat or prevent infectious diseases because of their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity, the potential role of vitamins in the COVID-19 treatment or prevention must be considered.

34131116	Molecular benchmarks of a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. A pressing concern in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and other viral outbreaks, is the extent to which the containment measures are halting the viral spread. A straightforward way to assess this is to tally the active cases and the recovered ones throughout the epidemic. Here, we show how epidemic control can be assessed with molecular information during a well characterized epidemic in Iceland. We demonstrate how the viral concentration decreased in those newly diagnosed as the epidemic transitioned from exponential growth phase to containment phase. The viral concentration in the cases identified in population screening decreased faster than in those symptomatic and considered at high risk and that were targeted by the healthcare system. The viral concentration persists in recovering individuals as we found that half of the cases are still positive after two weeks. We demonstrate that accumulation of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome can be exploited to track the rate of new viral generations throughout the different phases of the epidemic, where the accumulation of mutations decreases as the transmission rate decreases in the containment phase. Overall, the molecular signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infections contain valuable epidemiological information that can be used to assess the effectiveness of containment measures.	Mechanism;Prevention
34202029	A Hepatitis B Virus-Derived Peptide Can Inhibit Infection of Human Lung Cells with SARS-CoV-2 in a Type-1 Interferon-Dependent Manner. The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to develop effective therapeutic strategies. We evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 of a hepatitis B virus (HBV) hexamer peptide, Poly6, which is capable of eliciting an antiviral effect against human immunodeficiency virus -1 (HIV-1), as a novel HIV-1 integrase inhibitor, and a strong anticancer immune response in an IFN-I-dependent manner, as a novel potential adjuvant in anticancer immunotherapy. Here, we report that Poly6 exerts an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect, with an estimated 50% inhibitory concentration of 2.617 microM, in the human bronchial epithelial cell line, Calu-3 but not in Vero-E6 cells, which are deficient in type 1 interferon (IFN-I) signaling. We proved via assays based on mRNA profiles, inhibitors, or blocking antibodies that Poly6 can exert an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect in an IFN-I-dependent manner. We also found that Poly6 inhibits IL-6 production enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 in infected Calu-3 cells at both the transcription and the translation levels, mediated via IL-10 induction in an IFN-I-dependent manner. These results indicate the feasibility of Poly6 as an IFN-I-inducing COVID-19 drug with potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities.	Mechanism;Treatment
34369462	The impact of COVID-19 in pregnancy: Part I. Clinical presentations and untoward outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) is a pandemic disease with rapidly and widely disseminating to the world. Based on experiences about the H1N1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus pandemics, pregnant women who are infected are disproportionately more likely to develop severe illness and need more hospitalizations, intensive care and finally die of diseases compared to those nonpregnant counterparts or those pregnant women without infection. Although more than one half of pregnant women with COVID-19 are asymptomatic, and as well as their symptoms are frequently mild, this observation presents a further challenge regarding service provision, prevention, and management, in which this may result in overlooking the risk of COVID-19 during pregnancy. As predictable, despite much advance in critical care in recent decades, during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women with COVID-19 are really at higher risk to progress to severe illness; require hospitalization; need intensive care, such as the use of mechanical ventilation as well as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and of most important, die than their nonpregnant counterparts and pregnant women without COVID-19. The magnitude of the risk to pregnant women further extend to their newborn from COVID-19 with resultant significantly increasing perinatal and neonatal morbidity and mortality rates. The heightened risk of untoward outcomes in pregnant women emphasizes an urgent need of national or international recommendations and guidelines to optimize prevention and management strategies for COVID-19 in pregnancy. Active and passive prevention of COVID-19 is approved as effective strategies for women who attempt to be pregnant or during pregnancy. Understanding that pregnant women who are a vulnerable population is essential to improve the care in the novel and urgent COVID-19 pandemic. The current review is a part I to summarize the up-to-date information about the impact of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women and focus on clinical presentations and untoward pregnancy outcomes of these pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2.

34207046	"SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Significance of Oral Health Management in the Era of ""the New Normal with COVID-19"". More than a year ago, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, with the world approaching its fourth wave. During this period, vaccines were developed in a much shorter period than thought possible, with the initiation of the pertinent vaccination. However, oral cavities have come under renewed scrutiny worldwide because saliva, a mixture of salivary secretions, pharyngeal secretions, and gingival crevicular fluid, have not only been shown to contain infective viral loads, mediating the route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via droplet, aerosol, or contagion, but also used as a sample for viral RNA testing with a usefulness comparable to the nasopharyngeal swab. The oral cavity is an important portal for ingress of SARS-CoV-2, being an entryway to the bronchi, alveoli, and rest of the lower respiratory tract, causing inflammation by viral infection. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, coupled with proteases responsible for viral entry have been found to be expressed on the tongue and other oral mucosae, suggesting that the oral cavity is the site of virus replication and propagation. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the aspiration of oral bacteria (such as periodontal pathogens) along with saliva into the lower respiratory tract may be a complicating factor for COVID-19 because chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes are known COVID-19 comorbidities with a greater risk of disease aggravation and higher death rate. These comorbidities have a strong connection to chronic periodontitis and periodontal pathogens, and an oral health management is an effective measure to prevent these comorbidities. In addition, oral bacteria, particularly periodontal pathogens, could be proinflammatory stimulants to respiratory epithelia upon its exposure to aspirated bacteria. Therefore, it may be expected that oral health management not only prevents comorbidities involved in aggravating COVID-19 but also has an effect against COVID-19 progression. This review discusses the significance of oral health management in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the era of ""the new normal with COVID-19"" and COVID-19 prevention with reference to the hypothetical mechanisms that the authors and the other researchers have proposed."

34206658	Obesity Strongly Predicts COVID-19-Related Major Clinical Adverse Events in Coptic Clergy. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Coptic clergy, due to their specific work involving interaction with many people, could be subjected to increased risk of infection from COVID-19. The aim of this study, a sub-study of the COVID-19-CVD international study of the impact of the pandemic on the cardiovascular system, was to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 among Coptic priests and to identify predictors of clinical adverse events. METHODS: Participants were geographically divided into three groups: Group-I: Europe and USA, Group II: Northern Egypt, and Group III: Southern Egypt. Participants' demographic indices, cardiovascular risk factors, possible source of infection, number of liturgies, infection management, and major adverse events (MAEs), comprising death, or mechanical ventilation, were assessed. RESULTS: Out of the 1570 clergy serving in 25 dioceses, 255 (16.2%) were infected. Their mean age was 49.5 +/- 12 years and mean weekly number of liturgies was 3.44 +/- 1.0. The overall prevalence rate was 16.2% and did not differ between Egypt as a whole and overseas (p = 0.23). Disease prevalence was higher in Northern Egypt clergy compared with Europe and USA combined (18.4% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.03) and tended to be higher than in Southern Egypt (18.4% vs. 13.6%, p = 0.09). Ten priests (3.92%) died of COVID-19-related complications, and 26 (10.2) suffered a MAE. The clergy from Southern Egypt were more obese, but the remaining risk factors were less prevalent compared with those in Europe and USA (p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, obesity (OR = 4.180; 2.479 to 12.15; p = 0.01), age (OR = 1.055; 0.024 to 1.141; p = 0.02), and systemic hypertension (OR = 1.931; 1.169 to 2.004; p = 0.007) predicted MAEs. Obesity was the most powerful independent predictor of MAE in Southern Egypt and systemic hypertension in Northern Egypt (p < 0.05 for both). CONCLUSION: Obesity is very prevalent among Coptic clergy and seems to be the most powerful independent predictor of major COVID-19-related adverse events. Coptic clergy should be encouraged to follow the WHO recommendations for cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 prevention.	Diagnosis;Treatment;Prevention
34205483	COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance in Azuay Province, Ecuador: A Cross-Sectional Online Survey. We investigated the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance level in Azuay province, Ecuador through an online survey from 12th to 26th February (before the start of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Ecuador). Overall, 1219 respondents participated in the survey. The mean age was 32 +/- 13 years; 693 participants (57%) were female. In total, 1109 (91%) of the participants indicated they were willing to be vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, if the vaccine is at least 95% effective; 835 (68.5%) if it is 90% effective and 493 (40.5%) if it is 70% effective; 676 (55.5%) participants indicated they feared side effects and 237 (19.4%) thought the vaccine was not effective. Older age, having had a postgraduate education, a history of a negative COVID-19 test, a high level of worry of contracting COVID-19, believing that COVID-19 infection can be prevented with a vaccine and understanding there is currently an effective vaccine against COVID-19 were associated with higher vaccination acceptance. A vaccination education campaign will be needed to increase the knowledge of Ecuadorians about the COVID-19 vaccine and to increase their trust in the vaccine. People with a lower education level and living in rural areas may need to be targeted during such a campaign.	Prevention
34228626	A model-based estimation of the COVID-19 period prevalence and undiagnosed population in Canadian provinces. BACKGROUND: The development of a successful coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) control strategy requires a thorough understanding of the trends in the geographic and demographic distributions of the disease burden. In terms of the estimation of the population prevalence, this includes the crucial process of unravelling the number of patients who remain undiagnosed. OBJECTIVE: This study estimates the period prevalence of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and November 30, 2020 and the proportion of the infected population that remained undiagnosed for the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia in Canada. METHODS: A model-based mathematical framework based on a disease progression and transmission model was developed to estimate the historical prevalence of COVID-19 using provincial-level statistics reporting seroprevalence, diagnoses, and deaths resulting from COVID-19. The framework was applied to three different age cohorts (under 30; 30-69; and 70+) in each of the provinces studied. RESULTS: The estimates of COVID-19 period prevalence between March 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020 were 4.73% (4.42%-4.99%), 2.88% (2.75%-3.02%), 3.27% (2.72%-3.70%), 2.95% (2.77%-3.15%) for Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia, respectively. Among the cohorts considered in this study, the estimated total number of infections ranged from 2-fold the number of diagnoses (among Quebecers aged 70+: 26,476 diagnosed out of a total of 53,549) to 6-fold the number of diagnoses (among British Columbians aged 70+: 3,108 diagnosed out of a total of 18,147). CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates indicated that a high proportion of the population infected between March 1 and November 30, 2020, remained undiagnosed. Knowledge of the COVID-19 period prevalence and undiagnosed population can provide vital evidence for policy makers to consider when planning COVID-19 control interventions and vaccination programs.

34228597	Human immunoglobulin from transchromosomic bovines hyperimmunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen efficiently neutralizes viral variants. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with amino-acid substitutions and deletions in spike protein (S) can reduce the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may compromise immunity induced by vaccines. We report a polyclonal, fully human, anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin produced in transchromosomic bovines (Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2) hyperimmunized with two doses of plasmid DNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain S gene, followed by repeated immunization with S protein purified from insect cells. The resulting Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2, termed SAB-185, efficiently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) SARS-CoV-2 chimeras in vitro. Neutralization potency was retained for S variants including S477N, E484K, and N501Y, substitutions present in recent variants of concern. In contrast to the ease of selection of escape variants with mAbs and convalescent human plasma, we were unable to isolate VSV-SARS-CoV-2 mutants resistant to Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. This fully human immunoglobulin that potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide an effective therapeutic to combat COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34283839	Early detection of COVID-19 outbreaks using human mobility data. BACKGROUND: Contact mixing plays a key role in the spread of COVID-19. Thus, mobility restrictions of varying degrees up to and including nationwide lockdowns have been implemented in over 200 countries. To appropriately target the timing, location, and severity of measures intended to encourage social distancing at a country level, it is essential to predict when and where outbreaks will occur, and how widespread they will be. METHODS: We analyze aggregated, anonymized health data and cell phone mobility data from Israel. We develop predictive models for daily new cases and the test positivity rate over the next 7 days for different geographic regions in Israel. We evaluate model goodness of fit using root mean squared error (RMSE). We use these predictions in a five-tier categorization scheme to predict the severity of COVID-19 in each region over the next week. We measure magnitude accuracy (MA), the extent to which the correct severity tier is predicted. RESULTS: Models using mobility data outperformed models that did not use mobility data, reducing RMSE by 17.3% when predicting new cases and by 10.2% when predicting the test positivity rate. The best set of predictors for new cases consisted of 1-day lag of past 7-day average new cases, along with a measure of internal movement within a region. The best set of predictors for the test positivity rate consisted of 3-days lag of past 7-day average test positivity rate, along with the same measure of internal movement. Using these predictors, RMSE was 4.812 cases per 100,000 people when predicting new cases and 0.79% when predicting the test positivity rate. MA in predicting new cases was 0.775, and accuracy of prediction to within one tier was 1.0. MA in predicting the test positivity rate was 0.820, and accuracy to within one tier was 0.998. CONCLUSIONS: Using anonymized, macro-level data human mobility data along with health data aids predictions of when and where COVID-19 outbreaks are likely to occur. Our method provides a useful tool for government decision makers, particularly in the post-vaccination era, when focused interventions are needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks while mitigating the collateral damage from more global restrictions.

34198541	Management of a Mycotic Aneurysm in a Patient with COVID-19: A Case Report. The aim of this paper is to share our experience in managing a patient with Klebsiella pneumoniae mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm who was also infected with COVID-19. A 69-year-old male was transferred to our hospital for the management of an infra-renal mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm. During his hospital course, the patient contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). He was intubated due to respiratory distress. Over a short period, his mycotic aneurysm increased in size from 2.5 cm to 3.9 cm. An emergency repair of his expanding aneurysm was achieved using our previously described protocol of coating endovascular stents with rifampin. The patient was managed with a rifampin-coated endovascular stent graft without any major complications. Postoperatively, the patient did not demonstrate any neurological deficits nor any vascular compromise. He remained afebrile during his postoperative course and was extubated sometime thereafter. He was then transferred to the ward for additional monitoring prior to his discharge to a rehab hospital while being on long-term antibiotics. During his hospital stay, he was monitored with serial ultrasounds to ensure the absence of abscess formation, aortic aneurysm growth or graft endoleak. At 6 weeks after stent graft placement, he underwent a CT scan, which showed a patent stent graft, with a residual sac size of 2.5 cm without any evidence of abscess or endoleak. Over a follow-up period of 180 days, the patient remained asymptomatic while remaining on long-term antibiotics. Thus, in patients whose surgical risk is prohibitive, endovascular stent grafts can be used as a bridge to definitive surgical management.	Case Report
34284226	Elucidating causes of COVID-19 infection and related deaths after vaccination. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection has been reported in vaccination. In the current article, we try to elucidate various causes behind COVID-19 infection and mortality following COVID-19 vaccination and suggest possible strategies to counteract this threat. METHODS: We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords such as 'COVID-19', 'Pandemics', 'Vaccines', 'Mortality', 'deaths', 'infections', and 'India' on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate in from January to May 2021. Epidemiology, risk factors, Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) and mortality after COVID-19 vaccination were assessed. RESULTS: A number of factors have been associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection reported after vaccination. A high viral load, comorbidities, mutant strains, Variants of Concern (VOC) leading to Vaccine escape and casual attitude towards COVID Appropriate Behaviors appear to be the most important factors for infection and deaths after COVID-19 vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 Infection and mortality after COVID-19 vaccination are of great concern. Application of COVID Appropriate Behaviour (CAB) before and after vaccination is essential for the population. Effective Vaccines against mutant strains and enhanced vaccination drive are key strategies to avoid this quintessential threat. Early medical intervention in high-risk groups can prevent overall mortality.	Treatment
34374346	Comprehensive Laboratory Data Analysis to Predict the Clinical Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in 1,952 Patients in Daegu, Korea. Background: Laboratory parameter abnormalities are commonly observed in COVID-19 patients; however, their clinical significance remains controversial. We assessed the prevalence, characteristics, and clinical impact of laboratory parameters in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Daegu, Korea. Methods: We investigated the clinical and laboratory parameters of 1,952 COVID-19 patients on admission in nine hospitals in Daegu, Korea. The average patient age was 58.1 years, and 700 (35.9%) patients were men. The patients were classified into mild (N=1,612), moderate (N=294), and severe (N=46) disease groups based on clinical severity scores. We used chi-square test, multiple comparison analysis, and multinomial logistic regression to evaluate the correlation between laboratory parameters and disease severity. Results: Laboratory parameters on admission in the three disease groups were significantly different in terms of hematologic (Hb, Hct, white blood cell count, lymphocyte%, and platelet count), coagulation (prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time), biochemical (albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolytes), inflammatory (C-reactive protein and procalcitonin), cardiac (creatinine kinase MB isoenzyme and troponin I), and molecular virologic (Ct value of SARS-CoV-2 RdRP gene) parameters. Relative lymphopenia, prothrombin time prolongation, and hypoalbuminemia were significant indicators of COVID-19 severity. Patients with both hypoalbuminemia and lymphopenia had a higher risk of severe COVID-19. Conclusions: Laboratory parameter abnormalities on admission are common, are significantly associated with clinical severity, and can serve as independent predictors of COVID-19 severity. Monitoring the laboratory parameters, including albumin and lymphocyte count, is crucial for timely treatment of COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment

COVID-19, a newly discovered type of coronavirus, is the cause of the pandemic infection that was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. One of the most critical problems in this regard is to identify innovative drugs that may reduce or manage this global health concern. Nanoparticles have shown a pivotal role in drug delivery systems in recent decades. The surface of nanoparticles could be covered by a layer composed of different biomolecules (e.g., proteins and macromolecules) following the incubation with a biological fluid. This protein-rich layer is called ""Protein Corona."" In this study, an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation was used for investigating the monomeric B domain of the spike glycoprotein due to its role in the accessibility of the spike glycoprotein to single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The interaction energy values between the carbon nanotube and B domain of the viral spike glycoprotein were evaluated. The obtained results, based on Lennard-Jones potentials, demonstrated that SWCNTs had an affinity to the B domain of the S1 subunit in the spike glycoprotein. The adsorption of SWCNTs on the B domain surface led to a significant change in solvent-accessible surface, internal hydrogen bonds, and finally in the tertiary structure, which could provide a reasonable method to impede the interaction between the angiotensin-converting enzyme II and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. A decrease in the mean square displacement of the B domain was shown after the adsorption of SWCNTs as a result of increasing the hydrophobic-hydrophilic properties of the B domain. The arrangement of SWCNTs on the B domain surface and their interaction using the 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-d-glucopyranose group (988, 991, and 992) demonstrated that a change in the affinity of the S1 subunit could be used as a barrier to viral replication. The analysis of the SWCNT-B domain complex indicated that the presence of SWCNTs is able to cause alterations in the S1 subunit of the spike protein, and these nanotubes could be employed for further in-vitro and in-vivo antiviral studies. Also, SWCNTs are able to be utilized in drug delivery systems."	Mechanism;Treatment
34292136	Isolated and anxious: A qualitative exploration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals living with spinal cord injury in the UK. Objective: People living with spinal cord injury (SCI) are often immunocompromised, and at increased risk of respiratory infection. Given the restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, those with SCI may be at increased risk of health deterioration, though how this is experienced is poorly understood. This study explored the experiences of people living with SCI during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design: Participants completed an online survey consisting of demographic questions, and open-ended qualitative questions pertaining to their experiences during the pandemic. Thematic analysis was utilized for the analytical approach.Setting: Community-based sample in the UK.Participants: Participants were recruited via social media outlets of UK-based SCI-specific support charities, and snowball sampling (N = 42, F = 34, M = 8).Results: Key themes included: (1) lost access to health services and support, capturing concerns surrounding barriers to healthcare and rehabilitation, which intensified secondary consequences of SCI such as spasm and pain; (2) health anxiety, which was perpetuated by perceived heightened vulnerabilities to respiratory complications; (3) social isolation, with significantly reduced social contact, even with care providers, compounding health experiences.Conclusion: People living with SCI during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced a variety of personal physical, psychological, and social challenges, each of which could disrupt daily functioning and quality of life. Increased utilization of telehealth is recommended to support continued engagement in rehabilitation, and foster connection and community amongst others with SCI and health professionals.	Prevention
34216889	In silico analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the SARS-CoV-2 and therapeutic potential of existing antiviral drugs. The continued sustained threat of the SARS-CoV-2 virus world-wide, urgently calls for far-reaching effective therapeutic strategies for treating this emerging infection. Accordingly, this study explores mode of action and therapeutic potential of existing antiviral drugs. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 was mutable and similar to bat coronavirus RaTG13. Successive interactions between RdRp (nsp12 alone or in complex with cofactors nsp7-8) and viral RNA demonstrated that the binding affinity values remained the same, but the sites of interaction of RdRp (highly conserved for homologous sequences from different organisms) were altered in the presence of selected antiviral drugs such as Remdesivir, and Sofosbuvir. The antiviral drug Sofosbuvir reduced the number of hydrogen bonds formed between RdRp and RNA. Remdesivir bound more tightly to viral RNA than viral RdRp alone or the nsp12-7-8 hexadecameric complex, resulting in a significant number of hydrogen bonds being formed in the uracil-rich region. The interaction between nsp12-7-8 complex and RNA was mediated by specific interaction sites of nsp7-8. Therefore, the conserved nature of RdRp interaction sites, and alterations due to drug intervention indicate the therapeutic potential of the selected drugs. In this article, we provide additional focus on the interacting amino acids of the nsp7-8 complex and highlight crucial regions that could be targeted for precluding a correct recognition of subunits involved in the hexadecameric assembly, to rationally design molecules endowed with a significant antiviral profile.

34210200	There Is Something Very Personal About Seeing Someone's Face: Provider Perceptions of Video Visits in Home-Based Primary Care During COVID-19. The rapid deployment of video visits during COVID-19 may have posed unique challenges for home-based primary care (HBPC) practices due to their hands-on model of care and older adult population. This qualitative study examined provider perceptions of video visits during the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis in New York City (NYC) through interviews with HBPC clinical/medical directors, program managers, nurse practitioners/nurse managers, and social work managers (n = 13) at six NYC-area practices. Providers reported a combination of commercial (health system-supported) and consumer (e.g., FaceTime) technological platforms was essential. Video visit benefits included triaging patient needs, collecting patient information, and increasing scheduling capacity. Barriers included cognitive and sensory abilities, technology access, reliance on caregivers and aides, addressing sensitive topics, and incomplete exams. Effectively integrating video visits requires considering how technology can be proactively integrated into practice. A policy that promotes platform flexibility will be crucial in fostering video integration.	Prevention
34213362	High excess deaths in Sweden during the first wave of COVID-19: Policy deficiencies or 'dry tinder'? AIMS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Sweden registered a high level of excess deaths. Non-pharmaceutical interventions adopted by Sweden have been milder compared to those implemented in Denmark. Moreover, Sweden might have started the pandemic with a large proportion of vulnerable elderly with a high mortality risk. This study aimed to clarify whether excess mortality in Sweden can be explained by a large stock of 'dry tinder' instead of being attributed to faulty lockdown policies. METHODS: We analysed weekly death counts in Sweden and Denmark from July 2007 to June 2020. We used a novel method for short-term mortality forecasting to estimate expected and excess deaths during the first COVID-19 wave in Sweden and Denmark. RESULTS: In the first part of the epiyear 2019-2020, deaths were low in both Sweden and Denmark. In the absence of COVID-19, a relatively low level of death would be expected for the later part of the epiyear. The registered deaths were, however, way above the upper bound of the prediction interval in Sweden and within the range in Denmark. CONCLUSIONS: 'Dry tinder' can only account for a modest fraction of excess Swedish mortality. The risk of death during the first COVID-19 wave rose significantly for Swedish women aged >85 but only slightly for Danish women aged >85. The risk discrepancy seems more likely to result from differences between Sweden and Denmark in how care and housing for the elderly are organised, coupled with a less successful Swedish strategy of shielding the elderly.

34227993	Understanding physicians' preferences for telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: In contrast to the current broad dissemination of telemedicine across medical specialties, previous research focused on the effectiveness of telemedicine in special populations and for behavioral health encounters; demonstrating that both physician and patient factors impact the efficacious use of telemedicine. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated physician perceptions of the appropriateness of telemedicine for patients attending the primary care practices of a federally qualified health center in New York City. METHODS: Anonymous cross-sectional survey including closed and open-ended questions. We used chi-square to test whether providers from certain specialties were more likely to state they would use telemedicine in the future. We used t-test to compare age between those who would vs. would not use telemedicine. Then, we used logistic regression to test whether age and specialty were both correlated with desire to use telemedicine in the future. We used thematic content analysis to describe the reasons providers felt they would not want to use telemedicine in the future, and to describe the situations for which they felt telemedicine would be appropriate. RESULTS: Of 272 FHC providers who were sent the electronic survey, 159(58%) responded within the 2-week survey time frame. Mean age of providers was 45 years (range 28-75). Overall, 81% stated they would use telemedicine in the future. Compared to the Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Behavioral Health, Dental, and OB/GYN specialties, providers from Pediatrics, Med-Peds, Subspecialties and Surgery [Pro-telemedicine specialties] were more likely to believe telemedicine would be useful post pandemic (94% vs. 72%, p<0.05). Providers who reported they would use telemedicine in the future were younger [mean age 44(42-46) vs. 50(46-55), p<0.01). In regression analysis, both pro-telemedicine specialties and age were significantly associated with odds of reporting they would use telemedicine in the future [pro-specialties: 5.2(1.7-16.2); younger age: 1.05(1.01-1.08)]. Providers who did not want to use telemedicine in the future cited concerns about inadequate patient care, lack of physical patient interaction, technology issues, and lack of necessity. Providers who felt telemedicine would be useful cited the following situations: follow up visits, medication refills, urgent care, patient convenience, and specific conditions such has behavioral health, dermatology visits, and chronic care management. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of health providers in this resource poor setting in a federally qualified health center believed that telemedicine would be useful for providing care after the pandemic is over.

34334893	Effectiveness of ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 Vaccine: Experience of a tertiary care institute. Background: The first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 Corona Virus Vaccine (Covishield) was administered to the eligible beneficiaries of tertiary care institute of Western Maharashtra on 16 Jan 21 and in the past three months almost 97% of the staff has been vaccinated. The present study analyses the incidence of COVID cases in the unvaccinated and vaccinated population of the institute. Methods: All Covid 19 infections (RT-PCR positive) from 01 February 21 to 25 April 21 were included in the study and analyzed as per their vaccination status. To assess the COVID 19 transmission in contacts, Secondary Attack Rates (SAR) of the pre-vaccination period (Jun-Oct 20) was compared with the present SAR. Results: A total of 113 cases occurred in the study period (01 Feb to 25 Apr 21). Lower number of infections were observed among the fully vaccinated as compared to partially vaccinated and non-vaccinated. The overall vaccine effectiveness was found to be 88.6% (81.55-92.37) and 44.1% (4.55-67.3) in completely and partially vaccinated individuals respectively. Hazard Ratios for getting infected dropped significantly after 28 days of the second dose. The SAR in high risk contacts (HRCs) was found to be 4.25%, which was lower than SAR (20.6%) of pre-vaccination period. Conclusion: This is one of the earliest studies in India to report the impact of COVID-19 vaccination. The results indicate that the vaccine provides effective protection against COVID-19 infection. However, given the complex dynamics of vaccination, the role of NPIs and implementation of COVID appropriate behavior cannot be undermined.	Treatment
34212127	Lean approach to the management of patients undergoing intravitreal injections during COVID-19 pandemic. Background: To introduce Lean approach principles in the management of patients undergoing intravitreal injections (IVIs) for wet age-related macular degeneration. Methods: Retrospective single-centre cohort study. Services location, IVIs scheduling, utilization of staff, data recording methods, ophthalmic examination and surgical procedures were analysed; a new Intravitreal Injection Centre (IVIC) was developed according to Lean principles. Mean number of daily IVIs performed, mean time between registration and discharge, mean turnover time in between patients, percentages of performed IVIs on the monthly scheduled IVIs and of patients rating their experience 8/10 via standardized feedback questionnaires were retrospectively analysed. Results: The mean IVIs number per day increased from 20 +/- 4.08 to 50 +/- 7.07, and the mean time between registration and discharge of a patient decreased from 240 +/- 14.14 to 60 +/- 8.16 min (p = 0.00057 and p < 0.00001, respectively). Mean turnover time in between patients decreased from 10 +/- 1.41 to 8 +/- 2 min (p = 0.055). The percentage of monthly IVIs performed on the total of scheduled IVIs increased from 60% to 100%, and the percentage of satisfied patients who rated IVIC 8/10 increased from 45% to 95% (p = 0.0177 and p < 0.00105, respectively). Conclusion: The IVIC improved the quality, efficiency, speed of the overall procedures and clinical capacity of the IVI service through a fast one-way route for patients, limiting time wasted and total distance travelled. This model facilitates the creation of a one-stop clinic through the just-in-time management principle and may be relevant to other ophthalmology services.	Prevention

34293643	Computer Game Assisted Task Specific Exercises in the Treatment of Motor and Cognitive Function and Quality of Life in Stroke: A Randomized Control Study. OBJECTIVES: Computer game assisted task specific exercises (CGATSE) are rehabilitation gaming systems (RGS) used in stroke rehabilitation to facilitate patient performance of high intensity, task based, repetitive exercises aiming to enhance neuroplasticity. CGATSE maybe an appealing option in home based rehabilitation of stroke patients, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to determine the effects of CGATSE on hemiplegic arm-hand function, cognitive function and quality of life in stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty stroke patients were randomized into two groups. All participants received twenty sessions of physical therapy. In addition, the therapy group undertook thirty minutes of CGATSE using the Rejoyce gaming system; while the control group undertook thirty minutes of occupational therapy (OT). Motor function was evaluated before and after treatment using the Fugl Meyer upper extremity (FMUE), Brunnstrom stages of stroke recovery (BSSR) arm and hand. The CGATSE group also completed the Rejoyce arm hand function test (RAHFT). Cognitive function was evaluated using the mini mental state examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SS-QOL) scale. RESULTS: The FMUE, BSSR arm and SSQOL improved in both groups (p < 0.05). BSSR of the hand improved only in the CGATSE group (p = 0.024). RAHFT scores improved in the CGATSE group (p = 0.008). MoCA scores significantly improved in the control group (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: CGATSE may be beneficial in providing continuation of care after stroke, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic when home based rehabilitation options are becoming increasingly important. Benefits of CGATSE in improving cognitive function is less clear. RGS aimed at improving motor function may be compared to gaming systems designed to target cognitive development and more detailed higher cortical function deficit tests can be used as outcome measures.

Hypercoagulability has been found in patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) and has been identified as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Herein, we report the challenge in managing a patient presenting with a 5 day history of COVID-19 diagnosis, complicated by deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and ischemic stroke in the setting of atrial septal aneurysm, presumed patent foramen ovale and paradoxical embolism, identified to have clots in transit on echocardiogram. The application of anticoagulation was felt to be high risk. The patient was transferred to a tertiary facility where the patient underwent thrombus aspiration and was eventually complicated by hemorrhagic conversion of the stroke.	Case Report
34199761	The Many Faces of Innate Immunity in SARS-CoV-2 Infection. The innate immune system is important for initial antiviral response. SARS-CoV-2 can result in overactivity or suppression of the innate immune system. A dysregulated immune response is associated with poor outcomes; with patients having significant Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratios (NLR) due to neutrophilia alongside lymphopenia. Elevated interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 leads to overactivity and is a prominent feature of severe COVID-19 patients. IL-6 can result in lymphopenia; where COVID-19 patients typically have significantly altered lymphocyte subsets. IL-8 attracts neutrophils; which may play a significant role in lung tissue damage with the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps leading to cytokine storm or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Several factors like pre-existing co-morbidities, genetic risks, viral pathogenicity, and therapeutic efficacy act as important modifiers of SARS-CoV-2 risks for disease through an interplay with innate host inflammatory responses. In this review, we discuss the role of the innate immune system at play with other important modifiers in SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Mechanism;Diagnosis
34290717	Lectin Pathway Mediates Complement Activation by SARS-CoV-2 Proteins. Early and persistent activation of complement is considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Complement activation products orchestrate a proinflammatory environment that might be critical for the induction and maintenance of a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 by recruiting cells of the cellular immune system to the sites of infection and shifting their state of activation towards an inflammatory phenotype. It precedes pathophysiological milestone events like the cytokine storm, progressive endothelial injury triggering microangiopathy, and further complement activation, and causes an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date, the application of antiviral drugs and corticosteroids have shown efficacy in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but failed to ameliorate disease severity in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 pathology. This report demonstrates that lectin pathway (LP) recognition molecules of the complement system, such as MBL, FCN-2 and CL-11, bind to SARS-CoV-2 S- and N-proteins, with subsequent activation of LP-mediated C3b and C4b deposition. In addition, our results confirm and underline that the N-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds directly to the LP- effector enzyme MASP-2 and activates complement. Inhibition of the LP using an inhibitory monoclonal antibody against MASP-2 effectively blocks LP-mediated complement activation. FACS analyses using transfected HEK-293 cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein confirm a robust LP-dependent C3b deposition on the cell surface which is inhibited by the MASP-2 inhibitory antibody. In light of our present results, and the encouraging performance of our clinical candidate MASP-2 inhibitor Narsoplimab in recently published clinical trials, we suggest that the targeting of MASP-2 provides an unsurpassed window of therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of severe COVID-19.

34222130	"Determinants of the willingness of the general population to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in a developing country. Purpose: Vaccination is a cost-efficient intervention to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aims to assess the population's willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine in Jordan and investigate potential determinants of their acceptance. Materials and Methods: This study used an online survey distributed in November 2020, before introducing the vaccine, with items investigating socio-demographic characteristics, seasonal flu vaccination history, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance once available, and factors affecting their decision-making. Also, ""COVID-19 risk perception"" and beliefs toward COVID-19 vaccine benefits and barriers were assessed. Results: A total of 2,208 participants completed the survey with a participation rate of 13.1%. The mean+/-standard deviation age was 33.2+/-13.5, and 55.7% were females. Study participants were almost equally distributed between willingness, unwillingness, and indecision to take the COVID-19 vaccine (30.4%, 36.4%, and 31.5%, respectively). Younger adults, males, and those who were not married, do not have children, have a bachelor or higher education, employees or being students, healthcare workers, and those who reported receiving flu vaccine had higher rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance compared to their counterparts (p<0.001 for each category). COVID-19 risk perception, and perceived vaccine benefits, and barriers were significant predictors of intention. Among those undecided or unwilling to take the COVID-19 vaccine, its safety and side effects were the most common concerns. Conclusion: The low rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in a developing country is alarming, and a significant proportion are indecisive. Interventions to elevate vaccine acceptance by addressing its safety and efficacy and targeting vulnerable groups are recommended."	Prevention
34286136	Barriers and facilitators for clinical trial participation of underrepresented and non-underrepresented fibromyalgia patients: A cross-sectional internet survey. Background: There is a need of well-powered randomized clinical trials in fibromyalgia. However, challenges for recruitment are presented. This study aims to describe and assess the perception of barriers and facilitators and the associated factors for the participation of underrepresented and non-underrepresented fibromyalgia patients. Methods: We performed an online survey through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) targeting fibromyalgia patients from April 7 to July 3, 2020 during the COVID-19 stay home mandate and it was restricted to the United States of America. We described and compared the survey characteristics between underrepresented and non-underrepresented participants, and we performed logistic regression models to assess the associated factors with clinical trial participation. Results: In total, 481 completed the survey including 168 underrepresented fibromyalgia patients. Only (1) 11.09 % reported previous participation in clinical trials and the significant perceived barriers were investigator-related (lack of friendliness of research staff and the opportunity to receive the results) and center-related (privacy and confidentiality policies, and the institution's reputation); (2) the participation rate and perceived barriers and facilitators were similar between underrepresented and non-underrepresented patients; and was positively associated with low income, higher age, and clinical trial awareness from their physician; and negatively associated with the perception of investigator-related barriers; and (4) for the underrepresented population, the presence of emotional support. Conclusion: Our findings suggest low rates of participation, regardless of underrepresented population status. Strategies as involving their physician as liaison to increase the awareness of clinical trials, as well as improving patient-researcher communication should be considered in this population.

34227713	Telehealth in Australian cardiology: Insight into factors predicting the use of telephone versus video during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: The use of telehealth has increased dramatically in Australia in 2020 as a pragmatic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, however differences between telehealth modalities have not been established. AIM: To identify characteristics contributing to choosing telephone (TP) versus video-consultation (VC) and assess patient outcomes between telehealth modalities. METHODS: We conducted an observational study of cardiology outpatients at a tertiary hospital with appointments from 17 March 2020 to 12 August 2020. Demographic variables and appointment modality were compared between each group. Outcomes assessed were mortality, emergency (ED) presentations and cross over between appointment modalities. RESULTS: There were 1754 telemedicine encounters with 1188 patients seen by TP and 327 patients by VC. Consulting volume increased from previous years. Cardiac mortality was low (0.3%). There were no differences in mortality, or ED presentations between telehealth modalities. Patients choosing TP over VC were older (p < 0.001), more likely to be female (p = 0.005), non-English-speaking (p = 0.041), living in metropolitan Melbourne (p < 0.0001), undertaking a first appointment (p = 0.002) and seeing particular cardiologists (p < 0.001). VC patients were more likely to have early review (p = 0.015), and this was likely to be TP (p < 0.0001). TP patients were more likely to follow up in person (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: During COVID-19, we increased consultation volumes without adverse patient outcomes. We identified factors influencing choice of telemedicine modality which did not translate into differences in mortality or ED presentations. Telemedicine is a growing platform with an important role of facilitating access to healthcare for diverse patient groups. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	Prevention
34372955	SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey among health care providers in a Belgian public multiple-site hospital. Although the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is lasting for more than 1 year, the exposition risks of health-care providers are still unclear. Available evidence is conflicting. We investigated the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the staff of a large public hospital with multiple sites in the Antwerp region of Belgium. Risk factors for infection were identified by means of a questionnaire and human resource data. We performed hospital-wide serology tests in the weeks following the first epidemic wave (16 March to the end of May 2020) and combined the results with the answers from an individual questionnaire. Overall seroprevalence was 7.6%. We found higher seroprevalences in nurses [10.0%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.9-11.2] than in physicians 6.4% (95% CI 4.6-8.7), paramedical 6.0% (95% CI 4.3-8.0) and administrative staff (2.9%; 95% CI 1.8-4.5). Staff who indicated contact with a confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) colleague had a higher seroprevalence (12.0%; 95% CI 10.7-13.4) than staff who did not (4.2%; 95% CI 3.5-5.0). The same findings were present for contacts in the private setting. Working in general COVID-19 wards, but not in emergency departments or intensive care units, was also a significant risk factor. Since our analysis points in the direction of active SARS-CoV-2 transmission within hospitals, we argue for implementing a stringent hospital-wide testing and contact-tracing policy with special attention to the health care workers employed in general COVID-19 departments. Additional studies are needed to establish the transmission dynamics.	Prevention
34220503	Therapeutic Effectiveness and Safety of Repurposing Drugs for the Treatment of COVID-19: Position Standing in 2021. COVID-19, transmitted by SARS-CoV-2, is one of the most serious pandemic situations in the history of mankind, and has already infected a huge population across the globe. This horrendously contagious viral outbreak was first identified in China and within a very short time it affected the world's health, transport, economic, and academic sectors. Despite the recent approval of a few anti-COVID-19 vaccines, their unavailability and insufficiency along with the lack of other potential therapeutic options are continuing to worsen the situation, with valuable lives continuing to be lost. In this situation, researchers across the globe are focusing on repurposing prospective drugs and prophylaxis such as favipiravir, remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, lopinavir-ritonavir, azithromycin, doxycycline, ACEIs/ARBs, rivaroxaban, and protease inhibitors, which were preliminarily based on in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and toxicological study reports followed by clinical applications. Based on available preliminary data derived from limited clinical trials, the US National Institute of Health (NIH) and USFDA also recommended a few drugs to be repurposed i.e., hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and favipiravir. However, World Health Organization later recommended against the use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19 infections. Combining basic knowledge of viral pathogenesis and pharmacodynamics of drug molecules as well as in silico approaches, many drug candidates have been investigated in clinical trials, some of which have been proven to be partially effective against COVID-19, and many of the other drugs are currently under extensive screening. The repurposing of prospective drug candidates from different stages of evaluation can be a handy wellspring in COVID-19 management and treatment along with approved anti-COVID-19 vaccines. This review article combined the information from completed clinical trials, case series, cohort studies, meta-analyses, and retrospective studies to focus on the current status of repurposing drugs in 2021.

Objective: This living systematic review aims to provide a timely, rigorous and continuously updated summary of the evidence available on the role of pulmonary rehabilitation in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Design: This is the protocol of a living systematic review. Data sources: We will conduct searches in the L.OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that maps PICO questions to a repository maintained through regular searches in electronic databases, preprint servers, trial registries and other resources relevant to COVID-19. No date or language restrictions will be applied. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods: We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomized trials evaluating the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation as monotherapy or in combination with other interventions-versus sham or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will pool the results using meta-analysis and will apply the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Ethics and dissemination: No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.

34181810	Contributions of the international plant science community to the fight against infectious diseases in humans-part 2: Affordable drugs in edible plants for endemic and re-emerging diseases. The fight against infectious diseases often focuses on epidemics and pandemics, which demand urgent resources and command attention from the health authorities and media. However, the vast majority of deaths caused by infectious diseases occur in endemic zones, particularly in developing countries, placing a disproportionate burden on underfunded health systems and often requiring international interventions. The provision of vaccines and other biologics is hampered not only by the high cost and limited scalability of traditional manufacturing platforms based on microbial and animal cells, but also by challenges caused by distribution and storage, particularly in regions without a complete cold chain. In this review article, we consider the potential of molecular farming to address the challenges of endemic and re-emerging diseases, focusing on edible plants for the development of oral drugs. Key recent developments in this field include successful clinical trials based on orally delivered dried leaves of Artemisia annua against malarial parasite strains resistant to artemisinin combination therapy, the ability to produce clinical-grade protein drugs in leaves to treat infectious diseases and the long-term storage of protein drugs in dried leaves at ambient temperatures. Recent FDA approval of the first orally delivered protein drug encapsulated in plant cells to treat peanut allergy has opened the door for the development of affordable oral drugs that can be manufactured and distributed in remote areas without cold storage infrastructure and that eliminate the need for expensive purification steps and sterile delivery by injection.

34225817	Adapting coordinated specialty care in the post-COVID-19 era: study protocol for an integrative mixed-methods study. BACKGROUND: Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs provide evidence-based services for young people with a recent onset of a psychotic disorder. OnTrackNY is a nationally recognized model of CSC treatment in New York state. In 2019, OnTrackNY was awarded a hub within the Early Psychosis Intervention Network (EPINET) to advance its learning health care system (LHS). The OnTrackNY network is comprised of 23 CSC teams across New York state. OnTrack Central, an intermediary organization, provides training and implementation support to OnTrackNY teams. OnTrack Central coordinates a centralized data collection protocol for quality improvement and evaluation of program fidelity and a mechanism to support practice based-research. OnTrackNY sites' breadth coupled with OnTrack Central oversight provides an opportunity to examine the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis in New York State, and supplementary funding was awarded to the OnTrackNY EPINET hub in 2021 for that purpose. METHODS: This project will examine the implications of modifications to service delivery within the OnTrackNY LHS during and after the COVID-19 crisis. We will use the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modification-Enhanced (FRAME) to classify systematically, code, and analyze modifications to CSC services and ascertain their impact. We will utilize integrative mixed methods. Qualitative interviews with multi-level stakeholders (program participants, families, providers, team leaders, agency leaders, trainers (OnTrack Central), and decision-makers at the state and local levels) will be used to understand the process of making decisions, information about modifications to CSC services, and their impact. Analysis of OnTrackNY program data will facilitate examining trends in team staffing and functioning, and participant service utilization and outcomes. Study findings will be summarized in a CSC Model Adaptation Guide, which will identify modifications as fidelity consistent or not, and their impact on service utilization and care outcomes. DISCUSSION: A CSC Model Adaptation Guide will inform CSC programs, and the state and local mental health authorities to which they are accountable, regarding modifications to CSC services and the impact of these changes on care process, and participant service utilization and outcomes. The guide will also inform the development of tailored technical assistance that CSC programs may need within OnTrackNY, the EPINET network, and CSC programs nationally.

34217410	COVID-19 impact on screening test volume through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer early detection program, January-June 2020, in the United States. Women from racial and ethnic minority groups face a disproportionate burden of cervical and breast cancers in the United States. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic might exacerbate these disparities as supply and demand for screening services are reduced. The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) provides cancer screening services to women with low income and inadequate health insurance. We examined COVID-19's impact on NBCCEDP screening services during January-June 2020. We found the total number of NBCCEDP-funded breast and cervical cancer screening tests declined by 87% and 84%, respectively, during April 2020 compared with the previous 5-year averages for that month. The extent of declines varied by geography, race/ethnicity, and rurality. In April 2020, screening test volume declined most severely in Health and Human Services Region 2 - New York (96% for breast, 95% for cervical cancer screening) compared to the previous 5-year averages. The greatest declines were among American Indian/Alaskan Native women for breast cancer screening (98%) and Asian Pacific Islander women for cervical cancer screening (92%). Test volume began to recover in May and, by June 2020, NBCCEDP breast and cervical cancer screening test volume was 39% and 40% below the 5-year average for that month, respectively. However, breast cancer screening remained over 50% below the 5-year average among women in rural areas. NBCCEDP programs reported assisting health care providers resume screening.	Prevention
34202107	Modeling the Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination in Lebanon: A Call to Speed-Up Vaccine Roll Out. Four months into the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign, only 10.7% of the Lebanese population have received at least one dose, raising serious concerns over the speed of vaccine roll-out and its impact in the event of a future surge. Using mathematical modeling, we assessed the short-term impact of various vaccine roll-out scenarios on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic course in Lebanon. At current population immunity levels, estimated by the model at 40% on 15 April 2021, a large epidemic wave is predicted if all social distancing restrictions are gradually eased and variants of concern are introduced. Reaching 80% vaccine coverage by the end of 2021 will flatten the epidemic curve and will result in a 37% and 34% decrease in the peak daily numbers of severe/critical disease cases and deaths, respectively; while reaching intermediate coverage of 40% will result in only a 10-11% decrease in each. Reaching 80% vaccine coverage by August would prevent twice as many severe/critical disease cases and deaths than if it were reached by December. Easing restrictions over a longer duration resulted in more favorable vaccination impact. In conclusion, for vaccination to have impact in the short-term, scale-up has to be rapid and reach high coverage (at least 70%), while sustaining social distancing measures during roll-out. At current vaccination pace, this is unlikely to be achieved. Concerted efforts need to be made to overcome local challenges and substantially scale up vaccination to avoid a surge that the country, with its multiple crises and limited health-care capacity, is largely unprepared for.

34209238	Challenges in Maternal and Child Health Services Delivery and Access during Pandemics or Public Health Disasters in Low-and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review. Maternal and child health (MCH) has been a global priority for many decades and is an essential public health service. Ensuring seamless delivery is vital for desirable MCH outcomes. This systematic review outlined the challenges in accessing and continuing MCH services during public health emergencies-pandemics and disasters. A comprehensive search approach was built based on keywords and MeSH terms relevant to 'MCH services' and 'pandemics/disasters'. The online repositories Medline, CINAHL, Psyc INFO, and Epistemonikos were searched for studies. We included twenty studies-seven were on the Ebola outbreak, two on the Zika virus, five related to COVID-19, five on disasters, and one related to conflict situations. The findings indicate the potential impact of emergencies on MCH services. Low utilization and access to services have been described as common challenges. The unavailability of personal safety equipment and fear of infection were primary factors that affected service delivery. The available evidence, though limited, indicates the significant effect of disasters and pandemics on MCH. However, more primary in-depth studies are needed to understand better the overall impact of emergencies, especially the COVID-19 pandemic, on MCH. Our synthesis offers valuable insights to policymakers on ensuring the uninterrupted provision of MCH services during an emergency.	Prevention
34203025	Application of Clinical Decision Support System to Assist Breast Cancer Patients with Lifestyle Modifications during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Randomised Controlled Trial. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are data aggregation tools based on computer technology that assist clinicians to promote healthy weight management and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. We carried out a randomised controlled 3-month trial to implement lifestyle modifications in breast cancer (BC) patients by means of CDSS during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 55 BC women at stages I-IIIA were enrolled. They were randomly assigned either to Control group, receiving general lifestyle advice (n = 28) or the CDSS group (n = 27), to whom the CDSS provided personalised dietary plans based on the Mediterranean diet (MD) together with physical activity guidelines. Food data, anthropometry, blood markers and quality of life were evaluated. At 3 months, higher adherence to MD was recorded in the CDSS group, accompanied by lower body weight (kg) and body fat mass percentage compared to control (p < 0.001). In the CDSS arm, global health/quality of life was significantly improved at the trial endpoint (p < 0.05). Fasting blood glucose and lipid levels (i.e., cholesterol, LDL, triacylglycerols) of the CDSS arm remained unchanged (p > 0.05) but were elevated in the control arm at 3 months (p < 0.05). In conclusion, CDSS could be a promising tool to assist BC patients with lifestyle modifications during the COVID-19 pandemic.	Prevention
34335023	Narrative Analysis of the Impact of COVID-19 on Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Their Caregivers, and Healthcare Professionals in Italy. Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many lives, including those of people suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and their caregivers. The main aim of this study was to use narrative medicine, a validated approach promoting quality of care to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the quality of care, quality of life, psychological factors and social factors of people affected by COPD and their caregivers and healthcare professionals (HCPs). A secondary aim was to explore the role of telemedicine in combating isolation and providing access to care. Methods: A cross-sectional observational narrative medicine study was conducted between July and November 2020 across Italy. An online semi-structured questionnaire with a narrative plot was completed by 146 participants (79 COPD patients, 24 caregivers, and 43 HCPs). Narrations were analyzed with descriptive statistics and evaluated using NVivo 11 software to break down the text and identify recurring themes and major semantic clusters. Results: During the first lockdown, 58.22% of responses from COPD patients indicated terror, fear and/or apprehension; at reopening, this figure was 35.44%. Among caregivers, these figures were 100% at first lockdown and 45.83% at reopening. The metaphors most commonly used by patients to describe COPD and COVID-19 were monster and murderer, respectively. Patients described their homes more often as clean and lonely than as offering no shelter. The narratives of 42 COPD patients (45.2%) described coping. Only 12.6% of COPD patients reported regular access to medical visits during lockdown, while 59.1% of general practitioners and pulmonologists reported using telemedicine, which was perceived as satisfactory by both patients and caregivers. Conclusion: It is relevant to aim for a multidisciplinary and multilevel system of care that empowers telemedicine and integrates specific psychological support programs for COPD patients and their caregivers.

34210077	Obesity May Not Be Associated with 28-Day Mortality, Duration of Invasive Mechanical Ventilation and Length of Intensive Care Unit and Hospital Stay in Critically Ill Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2: A Retrospective Cohort Study. Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between obesity and 28-day mortality, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of stay at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and hospital in patients admitted to the ICU for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective observational cohort study in patients admitted to the ICU for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, in a single Dutch center. The association between obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m(2)) and 28-day mortality, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of ICU and hospital stay was investigated. Results: In 121 critically ill patients, pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by RT-PCR. Forty-eight patients had obesity (33.5%). The 28-day all-cause mortality was 28.1%. Patients with obesity had no significant difference in 28-day survival in Kaplan-Meier curves (log rank p 0.545) compared with patients without obesity. Obesity made no significant contribution in a multivariate Cox regression model for prediction of 28-day mortality (p = 0.124), but age and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were significant independent factors (p < 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). No statistically significant correlation was observed between obesity and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of ICU and hospital stay. Conclusion: One-third of the patients admitted to the ICU for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia had obesity. The present study showed no relationship between obesity and 28-day mortality, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay. Further studies are needed to substantiate these findings.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34348054	Perceptions of Telehealth Among Commercial Members Who Responded to a Patient-Experience Survey During the Onset of the Coronavirus-19 Pandemic. Introduction: The body of literature on telehealth perception among commercial members is limited. Therefore, we administered a patient-experienced survey (Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems [CG-CAHPS]) to determine member perceptions of telehealth, including willingness to pay for it and the likelihood to access it again. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional design, and members were assigned into two groups: those who had a telehealth visit with their primary care provider (PCP) or a provider in the same practice and those who had a telehealth visit with a provider outside of their PCP's practice. Logistic regression models were used to observe group differences in telehealth perception. Results: A total of 444 members replied to the CG-CAHPS survey and had a virtual visit; 21.1% had a telehealth visit with a provider outside of their PCP's practice, and 78.8% had a telehealth visit with their PCP or a provider in the same practice. Compared with members who saw a provider outside of their PCP's practice, members who saw their PCP or a provider in the same practice had 3.76 higher odds (confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.49-9.44) of rating in-person care as no different than virtual care; 2.29 higher odds (95% CI: 1.30-4.04) of reporting they would likely use telehealth again in the future; and 1.70 higher odds (95% CI: 0.99-2.91) of responding that they would be willing to pay an in-office visit copay for a telehealth visit. Conclusion: These results suggest that the familiarity of a member's PCP extends to the provider's practice and impacts member outlook on telehealth.	Prevention
34211534	Recommendations for use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in surgical procedures during the SARS-Cov pandemic. Since the Coronavirus Disease 2019 was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2019, many measures have been proposed to reduce the risks and the chances of contamination by the new coronavirus. In this context, wearing personal protective equipment is very important, especially in hospital environments and situations involving healthcare, since the degree of exposure is notably higher among the subgroup of healthcare professionals. The aim of this article is to propose a roadmap for the sequence of personal protective equipment use for surgical procedures during the coronavirus pandemic. The recommendations were based on Brazil's public health policy and World Health Organization guidelines. Five roadmaps for PPE sequences are presented for the most commonly performed procedures: fitting central venous catheters; fitting catheters requiring radioscopy; open surgeries; diagnostic and therapeutic angiography, and dressings.

34351276	I Want a Program That Looks at My Whole Life. A Focus Group Study on the Ideal Components for an mHealth Weight Management Program for African American Women. BACKGROUND: The high rate of obesity, ownership of smartphones, and online search for nutrition and dieting information among African American women (AAW) provide a unique opportunity to develop cost-effective, accessible, and acceptable mHealth weight management programs for them. Furthermore, they should participate in the development and evaluation of these programs. OBJECTIVE: To explore ideal components of a culturally relevant mHealth weight management program for AAW and to examine how these components may vary by age group. DESIGN: Twelve focus group triads were conducted with AAW in north central Florida. The framework method was used to manage, organize, synthesize, and analyze data themes by age groups: 18 to 29 (young), 30 to 50 (middle age), and 51+ (older). PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Thirty-six smartphone owners who expressed a desire to lose weight were recruited through several community partnerships. RESULTS: Based on body mass index (BMI), young women were classified as overweight (BMI 26.23 +/- 6.7), middle-aged women as obese (BMI30.72 +/- 8.31), and older women as obese (BMI 31.03 +/- 5.67). Most searched online for dieting information within the past 12 months. Five overarching themes for designing mHealth weight management programs were identified: (1) holistic program that goes beyond dieting; (2) social media integration for support and sense of community; (3) self-monitoring app; (4) two-way text messaging; and (5) programs of varying lengths and meaningful incentives. CONCLUSION: AAW were receptive to mHealth weight management programs, which may be appealing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Holistic programs of 4 to 6 weeks that addressed stress eating, had a social media component, and included a few educational texts per week may be appealing to AAW.	Prevention
34221352	Digital health and primary care: Past, pandemic and prospects. This article reflects on the breadth of digital developments seen in primary care over time, as well as the rapid and significant changes prompted by the COVID-19 crisis. Recent research and experience have shone further light on factors influencing the implementation and usefulness of these approaches, as well as unresolved challenges and unintended consequences. These are considered in relation to not only digital technology and infrastructure, but also wider aspects of health systems, the nature of primary care work and culture, patient characteristics and inequalities, and ethical issues around data privacy, inclusion, empowerment, empathy and trust. Implications for the future direction and sustainability of these approaches are discussed, taking account of novel paradigms, such as artificial intelligence, and the growing capture of primary care data for secondary uses. Decision makers are encouraged to think holistically about where value is most likely to be added, or risks being taken away, when judging which innovations to carry forward. It concludes that, while responding to this public health emergency has created something of a digital 'big bang' for primary care, an incremental, adaptive, patient-centered strategy, focused on augmenting rather than replacing existing services, is likely to prove most fruitful in the longer term.

34224069	Boswellic acids/Boswellia serrata extract as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic agent in the elderly. The most severe cases of COVID-19, and the highest rates of death, are among the elderly. There is an urgent need to search for an agent to treat the disease and control its progression. Boswellia serrata is traditionally used to treat chronic inflammatory diseases of the lung. This review aims to highlight currently published research that has shown evidence of potential therapeutic effects of boswellic acids (BA) and B. serrata extract against COVID-19 and associated conditions. We reviewed the published information up to March 2021. Studies were collected through a search of online electronic databases (academic libraries such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Egyptian Knowledge Bank). Several recent studies reported that BAs and B. serrata extract are safe agents and have multiple beneficial activities in treating similar symptoms experienced by patients with COVID-19. Because of the low oral bioavailability and improvement of buccal/oral cavity hygiene, traditional use by chewing B. serrata gum may be more beneficial than oral use. It is the cheapest option for a lot of poorer people. The promising effect of B. serrata and BA can be attributed to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, cardioprotective, anti-platelet aggregation, antibacterial, antifungal, and broad antiviral activity. B. serrata and BA act by multiple mechanisms. The most common mechanism may be through direct interaction with IkappaB kinases and inhibiting nuclear factor-kappaB-regulated gene expression. However, the most recent mechanism proposed that BA not only inhibited the formation of classical 5-lipoxygenase products but also produced anti-inflammatory LOX-isoform-selective modulators. In conclusion a small to moderate dose B. serrata extract may be useful in the enhancing adaptive immune response in mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19. However, large doses of BA may be beneficial in suppressing uncontrolled activation of the innate immune response. More clinical results are required to determine with certainty whether there is sufficient evidence of the benefits against COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34292583	The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the quality of life and treatment disruption of patients with breast cancer in a multiethnic cohort. BACKGROUND: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread, it remains unclear how vulnerable populations with preexisting health conditions like cancer have been affected. METHODS: Between July and September of 2020, the authors conducted a cross-sectional study that surveyed 2661 patients with breast cancer who were registered in the Chicago Multiethnic Epidemiologic Breast Cancer Cohort and received 1300 responses (71.5% White patients and 22.4% Black patients). The survey measured the psychosocial well-being of participants before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined whether they experienced any type of financial challenges or treatment disruption. RESULTS: The results indicated that feelings of isolation increased significantly during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the overall median isolation/stress score was 1.2 on a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always), which was not significantly different between White patients and Black patients. One-third of patients experienced some type of financial challenge during this time. Medicaid recipients, of whom almost 80% were Black, were more likely to experience financial challenges. In addition, approximately one-fourth of patients experienced difficulty getting treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the quality of life of patients with breast cancer and their scheduled treatments have been adversely affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that more support should be provided by hospital centers and the medical research community to patients with cancer during this challenging pandemic. LAY SUMMARY: The authors surveyed patients with breast cancer in Chicago using a questionnaire to examine how their lives have been affected during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The results indicate that the lives of patients with breast cancer and their scheduled treatments have been adversely affected during the pandemic. In addition, patients who were covered by Medicaid, most of whom were Black, were more likely to experience financial challenges. The findings suggest that hospital centers and the medical research community should reach out and provide more information to support patients with cancer during this challenging pandemic.

34206211	Rhamnolipids Nano-Micelles as a Potential Hand Sanitizer. COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2, which continues to cause global health and economic problems since emerging in China in late 2019. Until now, there are no standard antiviral treatments. Thus, several strategies were adopted to minimize virus transmission, such as social distancing, face covering protection and hand hygiene. Rhamnolipids are glycolipids produced formally by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and as biosurfactants, they were shown to have broad antimicrobial activity. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of rhamnolipids against selected multidrug resistant bacteria and SARS-CoV-2. Rhamnolipids were produced by growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain LeS3 in a new medium formulated from chicken carcass soup. The isolated rhamnolipids were characterized for their molecular composition, formulated into nano-micelles, and the antibacterial activity of the nano-micelles was demonstrated in vitro against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive drug resistant bacteria. In silico studies docking rhamnolipids to structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 was also performed. We demonstrated the efficient and specific interaction of rhamnolipids with the active sites of these proteins. Additionally, the computational studies suggested that rhamnolipids have membrane permeability activity. Thus, the obtained results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be another target of rhamnolipids and could find utility in the fight against COVID-19, a future perspective to be considered.

34287033	Coinfections with Other Respiratory Pathogens among Patients with COVID-19. Emerging evidence indicates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected individuals are at an increased risk for coinfections; therefore, physicians need to be cognizant about excluding other treatable respiratory pathogens. Here, we report coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens in patients admitted to the coronavirus disease (COVID) care facilities of an Indian tertiary care hospital. From June 2020 through January 2021, we tested 191 patients with SARS-CoV-2 for 33 other respiratory pathogens using an fast track diagnostics respiratory pathogen 33 (FTD-33) assay. Additionally, information regarding other relevant respiratory pathogens was collected by reviewing their laboratory data. Overall, 13 pathogens were identified among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 46.6% (89/191) of patients had coinfection with one or more additional pathogens. Bacterial coinfections (41.4% [79/191]) were frequent, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and Pneumocystis jirovecii or Legionella pneumophila were also identified. The viral coinfection rate was 7.3%, with human adenovirus and human rhinovirus being the most common. Five patients in our cohort had positive cultures for Acinetobacter baumannii and K. pneumoniae, and two patients had active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. In total, 47.1% (90/191) of patients with coinfections were identified. The higher proportion of patients with coinfections in our cohort supports the systemic use of antibiotics in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with rapid de-escalation based on respiratory PCR/culture results. The timely and simultaneous identification of coinfections can contribute to improved health of COVID-19 patients and enhanced antibiotic stewardship during the pandemic. IMPORTANCE Coinfections in COVID-19 patients may worsen disease outcomes and need further investigation. We found that a higher proportion of patients with COVID-19 were coinfected with one or more additional pathogens. A better understanding of the prevalence of coinfection with other respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients and the profile of pathogens can contribute to effective patient management and antibiotic stewardship during the current pandemic.

34211556	Characteristics and Developments in Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy for COVID-19: An Update. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has so far resulted in over a hundred million people being infected. COVID-19 poses a threat to human health around the world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been confirmed as the pathogenic virus of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus family of viruses and is mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract. It has been proven that SARS-CoV-2 mainly targets angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptors on the surface of various cells in humans. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Current evidence suggests that the damage caused by the virus may be closely related to the induction of cytokine storms in COVID-19. No specific drugs or measures have yet to be shown to cure COVID-19 completely. Cell-based approaches, primarily mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have been identified to have anti-inflammatory and immune functions in COVID-19. Clinical studies about using MSCs and its derivatives-exosomes for COVID-19 treatment-are under investigation. Here, we review the current progress of the biological characteristics, clinical manifestations, and cell-based treatment development for COVID-19. Providing up-to-date information on COVID-19 and potential MSC therapies will help highlight routes to prevent and treat the disease.	Mechanism;Treatment;Diagnosis
34338723	Defining Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Placentitis: A Report of 7 Cases with Confirmatory In Situ Hybridization, Distinct Histomorphologic Features, and Evidence of Complement Deposition. CONTEXT: -Case reports and rare case series have demonstrated variable placental pathology in the setting of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In rare small studies demonstrating infection of the placental parenchyma, histologic manifestations have included variable degrees of histiocytic intervillositis, perivillous fibrin deposition, and syncytiotrophoblast necrosis. OBJECTIVE: -To characterize the placental pathological features of SARS-CoV-2 infected placentas, irrespective of fetal-maternal transmission, and to examine the frequency of C4d activation in such cases. DESIGN: -Retrospective study of seven placentas from mothers with active SARS-CoV-2 infection and placental infection as demonstrated by RNA in situ hybridization. RESULTS: -Six placentas were from live-born neonates (5 singletons, 1 non-fused diamniotic-dichorionic twin placenta), and one was from a stillbirth. Five of the eight neonates (including the stillbirth) tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, and all were negative for neonatal infection. The remaining three neonates were well at time of discharge. All placentas were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RNA in situ hybridization and demonstrated variable degrees of histiocytic intervillositis, perivillous fibrin deposition, and trophoblast necrosis. Three cases demonstrated features of fetal vascular malperfusion. CD68 highlighted intervillous histiocytes. C4d expression was present along the villous borders in 6 of 7 cases. CONCLUSIONS: -SARS-CoV-2 placentitis is defined by the triad of histiocytic intervillositis, perivillous fibrin deposition, and trophoblast necrosis. The features may occur in cases without confirmed transplacental transmission. The damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 placentitis is likely mediated by complement activation.	Case Report
34358158	Neutralizing Antibodies Titers and Side Effects in Response to BNT162b2 Vaccine in Healthcare Workers with and without Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection. The main expected result of a vaccine against viruses is the ability to produce neutralizing antibodies. Currently, several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being applied to prevent mortal complications, being Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) one of the first to be authorized in the USA and Mexico (11 December 2020). This study evaluated the efficacy of this vaccine on antibody production with neutralizing capacity and its side effects in healthcare workers with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and in a group of unvaccinated individuals with prior COVID-19. The main findings are the production of 100% neutralizing antibodies in both groups after the second dose, well-tolerated adverse effects, the possible presence of immunosenescence, and finally, we support that a single dose of this vaccine in individuals with prior COVID-19 would be sufficient to achieve an immunization comparable to people without prior COVID-19 with a complete vaccination program (2 doses).

34285007	Economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and public health measures: results from an anonymous online survey in Thailand, Malaysia, the UK, Italy and Slovenia. OBJECTIVES: To understand the impact of COVID-19 and public health measures on different social groups, we conducted a mixed-methods study in five countries ('SEBCOV-social, ethical and behavioural aspects of COVID-19'). Here, we report the results of the online survey. STUDY DESIGN AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Overall, 5058 respondents from Thailand, Malaysia, the UK, Italy and Slovenia completed the self-administered survey between May and June 2020. Poststratification weighting was applied, and associations between categorical variables assessed. Frequency counts and percentages were used to summarise categorical data. Associations between categorical variables were assessed using Pearson's chi(2) test. Data were analysed in Stata 15.0 RESULTS: Among the five countries, Thai respondents reported having been most, and Slovenian respondents least, affected economically. The following factors were associated with greater negative economic impacts: being 18-24 years or 65 years or older; lower education levels; larger households; having children under 18 in the household and and having flexible/no income. Regarding social impact, respondents expressed most concern about their social life, physical health, mental health and well-being.There were large differences between countries in terms of voluntary behavioural change, and in compliance and agreement with COVID-19 restrictions. Overall, self-reported compliance was higher among respondents who self-reported a high understanding of COVID-19. UK respondents felt able to cope the longest and Thai respondents the shortest with only going out for essential needs or work. Many respondents reported seeing news perceived to be fake, the proportion varying between countries, with education level and self-reported levels of understanding of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that COVID-19 and public health measures have uneven economic and social impacts on people from different countries and social groups. Understanding the factors associated with these impacts can help to inform future public health interventions and mitigate their negative consequences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: TCTR20200401002.

34285133	Masitinib is a broad coronavirus 3CL inhibitor that blocks replication of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for antiviral agents that treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. We screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs against OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common cold and evaluated the top hits against SARS-CoV-2. Twenty drugs significantly inhibited replication of both viruses in vitro. Eight of these drugs inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro, with the most potent being masitinib, an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor. X-ray crystallography and biochemistry show that masitinib acts as a competitive inhibitor of 3CLpro. Mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then treated with masitinib showed >200-fold reduction in viral titers in the lungs and nose, as well as reduced lung inflammation. Masitinib was also effective in vitro against all tested variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1).	Mechanism;Treatment
34338473	Epidemiology of tick-borne encephalitis in Poland (2010-2019) and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the notified incidence of the disease. INTRODUCTION: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is endemic in many parts of Eurasia including countries previously considered to be free from the disease. The incidence of TBE is changing owing to various ecological and climatic factors. The factors influencing the variability of the number of TBE cases are still under investigation. In 2020 the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged causing COVID-19 pandemic. Governments have reorganized health care systems to contain a surge of COVID-19 cases and avoid hospital overload. Moreover, new measures have modified several aspects of social habits leading to a change in the incidence of numerous diseases. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of TBE in the last decade (2010-2019) and to demonstrate the impact of the surge of SARS-CoV-2 infections on the TBE incidence as reported to a national surveillance database. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed the analysis of the TBE notification from the epidemiologic reports in the years 2010-2019 and in the pandemic year 2020 at a national and regional level in Poland. We included data from two infectious disease departments located in the most TBE-prevalent province of Poland. RESULTS: Most cases of TBE occur in two provinces of Northeastern Poland from May to December. The increasing temporal trend occurred in Poland in 2016-2017. The increased number of cases of COVID-19 coincided with a reduction of the number of the reported TBE cases in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Tick-borne encephalitis virus activity in Poland is invariably concentrated in endemic regions of Northeastern Poland fluctuating considerably from year to year. The decrease of TBE incidence with surge of COVID-19 patients conceivably resulted from underreporting due to limited access to specialized diagnostics. In endemic areas, TBE should be included in the differential diagnostics in all the cases when the central nervous system infection in suspected.	Prevention
34199681	RF Sensing Based Breathing Patterns Detection Leveraging USRP Devices. Non-contact detection of the breathing patterns in a remote and unobtrusive manner has significant value to healthcare applications and disease diagnosis, such as in COVID-19 infection prediction. During the epidemic prevention and control period of COVID-19, non-contact approaches have great significance because they minimize the physical burden on the patient and have the least requirement of active cooperation of the infected individual. During the pandemic, these non-contact approaches also reduce environmental constraints and remove the need for extra preparations. According to the latest medical research, the breathing pattern of a person infected with COVID-19 is unlike the breathing associated with flu and the common cold. One noteworthy symptom that occurs in COVID-19 is an abnormal breathing rate; individuals infected with COVID-19 have more rapid breathing. This requires continuous real-time detection of breathing patterns, which can be helpful in the prediction, diagnosis, and screening for people infected with COVID-19. In this research work, software-defined radio (SDR)-based radio frequency (RF) sensing techniques and machine learning (ML) algorithms are exploited to develop a platform for the detection and classification of different abnormal breathing patterns. ML algorithms are used for classification purposes, and their performance is evaluated on the basis of accuracy, prediction speed, and training time. The results show that this platform can detect and classify breathing patterns with a maximum accuracy of 99.4% through a complex tree algorithm. This research has a significant clinical impact because this platform can also be deployed for practical use in pandemic and non-pandemic situations.	Diagnosis
34285652	Challenges and Adaptation in Otorhinolaryngology Practice During Pandemic Lockdown: Experience from a Malaysian COVID-19 Hospital. COVID-19 has taken the world by storm: since the first few cases appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and by June 2020 there were more than 10 million cases of COVID-19 cases worldwide. Malaysia had its first case in January 2020 and acted promptly by implementing several drastic measures to contain the disease. Subsequently, the Ministry of Health Malaysia has implemented guidelines and recommendations on the management of COVID-19. The Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (ORL-HNS) provides services for patients with ear, nose, throat, head and neck diseases and provides audiology, speech and language therapy, as well as undergraduate and postgraduate training. As the department's staff is heavily involved in examinations and interventions of upper aerodigestive tract problems, the challenges are distinctly different from other specialties. This article discusses how COVID-19 affected ORL-HNS services and what measures were taken in Hospital Melaka, Malaysia.	Prevention
34205613	Attitudes towards the COVID-19 Vaccine and Willingness to Get Vaccinated among Healthcare Workers in French Guiana: The Influence of Geographical Origin. Background: In the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the expansion of the more transmissible 20J/501Y.V3 (Gamma) variant of concern (VOC), mRNA vaccines have been made available in French Guiana, an overseas French territory in South America, from mid-January 2021. This study aimed to estimate the willingness to be vaccinated and the socio-demographic and motivational correlates among Health Care Workers (HCWs) in French Guiana. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from January 22 to March 26, 2021 among a sample of HCWs in French Guiana. They were asked about their willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and vaccine hesitancy, vaccine uptake and vaccines attitudes. Factors associated with willingness to get vaccinated have been analyzed with ordinal logistic regression, using Stata software. Results: A total of 579 HCWs were interviewed, including 220 physicians and 200 nurses most often working in hospital (54%) or in the liberal sector (22%). Overall, 65.6% of respondents reported that they were willing or had already been vaccinated against COVID-19, while 24.3% of respondents reported that they did not want to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and 11.2% were unsure. HCWs were more willing to get vaccine if they were older, were worried about COVID-19 and were confident in the management of epidemic. Conversely, participants were less likely to have been vaccinated or willing to if they were nurses or of another non-medical profession, born in French Guiana, feared adverse effects, or if they did not trust pharmaceutical companies and management of the epidemic by authorities. Conclusion: Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern among HCWs in French Guiana when considering the current active epidemic with Gamma VOC. General vaccine hesitancy and concerns about future side effects in particular represent important barriers. Low confidence in government and science are significant in COVID-19 vaccine refusal among non-medical staffs. Public health messaging with information on vaccine safety should be tailored to address these concerns. The specific challenges of HCWs from French Guiana must be taken into account.	Treatment
34219901	Combining Probabilistic Forecasts of COVID-19 Mortality in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed forecasting models at the forefront of health policy making. Predictions of mortality, cases and hospitalisations help governments meet planning and resource allocation challenges. In this paper, we consider the weekly forecasting of the cumulative mortality due to COVID-19 at the national and state level in the U.S. Optimal decision-making requires a forecast of a probability distribution, rather than just a single point forecast. Interval forecasts are also important, as they can support decision making and provide situational awareness. We consider the case where probabilistic forecasts have been provided by multiple forecasting teams, and we combine the forecasts to extract the wisdom of the crowd. We use a dataset that has been made publicly available from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. A notable feature of the dataset is that the availability of forecasts from participating teams varies greatly across the 40 weeks in our study. We evaluate the accuracy of combining methods that have been previously proposed for interval forecasts and predictions of probability distributions. These include the use of the simple average, the median, and trimming methods. In addition, we propose several new weighted combining methods. Our results show that, although the median was very useful for the early weeks of the pandemic, the simple average was preferable thereafter, and that, as a history of forecast accuracy accumulates, the best results can be produced by a weighted combining method that uses weights that are inversely proportional to the historical accuracy of the individual forecasting teams.

34221254	Cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal co-morbidities in COVID-19 patients: A systematic-review and meta-analysis. Background: COVID-19 has infected over 35 million people worldwide and led to over 1 million deaths. Several risk factors that increase COVID-19 severity have emerged, including age and a history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or kidney disease. However, a number of outstanding questions persist, including whether the above comorbidities correlate with increased mortality from COVID-19 or whether age is a significant confounding variable that accounts for the observed relationship between COVID-19 severity and other comorbidities. Methods and Findings: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies documenting COVID-19 patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic kidney disease. We classified COVID-19 cases into severe/non-severe or deceased/surviving and calculated the odds ratio (OR) for each of the four comorbidities in these cohorts. 36 studies, comprising 22,573 patients, are included in our meta-analysis. We found that hypertension is the most prevalent comorbidity in deceased COVID-19 patients (55.4%; CI: 49.4-61.3%), followed by cardiovascular disease (30.7%; CI: 22.6-38.8%), cerebrovascular disease (13.4%; CI: 9.12-19.2%), then chronic kidney disease (9.05%; CI: 5.57-15.0%). The risk of death is also significantly higher for patients with these comorbidities, with the greatest risk factor being chronic kidney disease (OR: 8.86; CI: 5.27-14.89), followed by cardiovascular disease (OR: 6.87; CI: 5.56-8.50), hypertension (OR: 4.87; CI: 4.19-5.66), and cerebrovascular disease (OR: 4.28; CI: 2.86-6.41). These risks are significantly higher than previously reported, while correlations between comorbidities and COVID-19 severity are similar to previously reported figures. Using meta-regression analysis with age as a moderating variable, we observed that age contributes to the observed risks but does not explain them fully. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, we observed that cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and kidney-related comorbidities in COVID-19 significantly contributes to greater risk of mortality and increased disease severity. We also demonstrated that age may not be a confounder to these associations.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34333726	Twelve Months with COVID-19: What Gastroenterologists Need to Know. Corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) is the latest global pandemic. COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and, apart from respiratory symptoms, patients often present with gastrointestinal symptoms and liver involvement. Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS), in this review, we report a practical up-to-date reference for the physician in their clinical practice with patients affected by chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases (inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, chronic liver disease) at the time of COVID-19. First, we summarised data on the origin and pathogenetic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. Then, we performed a literature search up to December 2020 examining clinical manifestations of GI involvement. Next, we illustrated and summarised the most recent guidelines on how to adhere to GI procedures (endoscopy, liver biopsy, faecal transplantation), maintaining social distance and how to deal with immunosuppressive treatment. Finally, we focussed on some special conditions such as faecal-oral transmission and gut microbiota. The rapid accumulation of information relating to this condition makes it particularly essential to revise the literature to take account of the most recent publications for medical consultation and patient care.

34222744	Impact of COVID-19 in Liver Disease Progression. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which has infected millions of people worldwide in only a few months. A minority, but significant number, of infected individuals require hospitalization and intensive care. From the start of this new virus pandemic, it was apparent that obese and/or diabetic individuals had a bad prognosis for COVID-19 progression, strongly suggesting an association between liver disease and severe COVID-19. Because chronic liver disease (CLD) is associated with immune dysregulation and inflammation, it is unsurprising that patients with CLD may carry a greater risk of adverse outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initial COVID-19 data have also indicated that healthy infected individuals display abnormal liver function tests, suggesting a possible direct implication of SARS-CoV-2 in liver damage. Here we show that COVID-19 affects the liver metabolism and increases the morbidity and mortality of individuals with underlying CLD.	Mechanism;Treatment;Diagnosis
34221893	Challenges to detect SARS-CoV-2 on environmental media, the need and strategies to implement the detection methodologies in wastewaters. Understanding risks, putting in place preventative methods to seamlessly continue daily activities are essential tools to fight a pandemic. All social, commercial and leisure activities have an impact on the environmental media. Therefore, to accurately predict the fate and behavior of viruses in the environment, it is necessary to understand and analyze available detection methods, possible transmission pathways and preventative techniques. The aim of this review is to critically analyze and summarize the research done regarding SARS-COV-2 virus detection, focusing on sampling and laboratory detection methods in environmental media. Special attention will be given to wastewater and sewage sludge. This review has summarized the survival of the virus on surfaces to estimate the risk carried by different environmental media (water, wastewater, air and soil) in order to explain which communities are under higher risk. The critical analysis concludes that the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with current technologies and sampling strategies would reveal the presence of the virus. This information could be used to design systematic sampling points throughout the sewage systems when available, taking into account peak flows and more importantly economic factors on when to sample. Such approaches will provide clues for potential future viral outbreak, saving financial resources by reducing testing necessities for viral detection, hence contributing for more appropriate confinement policies by governments and could be further used to define more precisely post-pandemic or additional waves measures if/ when needed.

34362142	COVID-19: A New Challenge for Pulmonary Rehabilitation? Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), currently one of the immense burdens for global healthcare, is often characterized by rapid progression and the occurrence of symptoms particularly affecting the respiratory system. Continuous refinement of treatment protocols improves prognosis; however, COVID-19 survivors are often left with the symptomatic burden of dyspnea and fatigue. Therefore, it is necessary to continue comprehensive treatment including pulmonary rehabilitation. This study aimed to review the available literature on pulmonary rehabilitation in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The pulmonary rehabilitation programs implemented various forms, i.e., aerobic exercise, breathing exercises, effective cough exercises, diaphragmatic breathing, and respiratory muscle training. Based on the literature review, it was found that pulmonary rehabilitation programs result in an improvement of respiratory function, reduction of fatigue and dyspnea, and improvement in exercise endurance and quality of life after completing both short-term and long-term programs, but depression and anxiety problems did not improve. Pulmonary rehabilitation combined with psychological therapy is crucial for COVID-19 survivors and plays a substantial role in patients' recovery.	Treatment

34351878	"Successful Treatment of a 39-Year-Old COVID-19 Patient with Respiratory Failure by Selective C-Reactive Protein Apheresis. BACKGROUND High C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are associated with poor prognosis. CRP, by activating the classical complement pathway and interacting with macrophages via Fc gamma receptors, can cause pulmonary inflammation with subsequent fibrosis. Recently, we have reported first-in-man CRP apheresis in a ""high-risk"" COVID-19 patient. Treatment was unfortunately clinically unsuccessful. Here, we report on successful CRP apheresis treatment in a ""lower-risk"" COVID-19 patient with respiratory failure. CASE REPORT A 39-year-old male patient suffering from fatigue, dyspnea, and fever for 4 days was referred to us. The patient had to be intubated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of a throat smear revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mutation analysis revealed the VOC B. 1.1.7 variant. CRP levels were 79.2 mg/L and increased to 161.63 mg/L. Procalcitonin (PCT) levels were continuously normal (<0.5 ng/ml). Antibiotic therapy was started to avoid bacterial superinfection. CRP apheresis was performed once via central venous access. CRP levels declined from a maximum of 161.63 mg/L to 32.58 mg/L. No apheresis-associated adverse effects were observed. Subsequently, CRP plasma levels declined day by day and normalized on day 5. The patient was extubated on day 5 and discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on day 6. A second low CRP peak (maximum 22.41 mg/L) on day 7 remained clinically inapparent. The patient was discharged in good clinical condition with a CRP level of 6.94 mg/L on day 8. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce an uncontrolled CRP-mediated autoimmune response of ancient immunity. In this patient, the autoimmune response was potently and successfully suppressed by early selective CRP apheresis."	Case Report
34334957	The effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the demand for health care and on mortality: evidence from COVID-19 in Scandinavia. We study the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against COVID-19 on the allocation of scarce resources in the hospital sector in Scandinavia. Denmark and Norway imposed strict NPIs, but Sweden followed an extraordinarily lenient approach. We use an event study to compare COVID-19 hospitalizations, intensive-care (ICU) patients, and deaths in Sweden with Denmark and Norway. The outcome variables initially follow a common trend, but diverge 2-3 weeks after lockdown. Both the timing of the effect and the similarity in the trend between Denmark and Norway are highly consistent with a causal effect of the lockdown. We use our event study to build a counterfactual model that predicts the outcome variables for Denmark and Norway if they had followed Sweden's approach. In the absence of strict NPIs, the peak number of hospitalizations would have been 2.5 (3.5) times as large in Denmark (Norway). Overall, Denmark (Norway) would have had 334 (671) percent more hospital-patient days, 277 (379) percent more ICU-patient days, and 402 (1015) percent more deaths. The benefit of lockdown in terms of healthcare and mortality costs amounts to between 1 and 4 (0.9 and 3.5) percent of GDP in Denmark (Norway).	Prevention
34206406	High-Throughput Fluorescent Assay for Inhibitor Screening of Proteases from RNA Viruses. Spanish flu, polio epidemics, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are the most profound examples of severe widespread diseases caused by RNA viruses. The coronavirus pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) demands affordable and reliable assays for testing antivirals. To test inhibitors of viral proteases, we have developed an inexpensive high-throughput assay based on fluorescent energy transfer (FRET). We assayed an array of inhibitors for papain-like protease from SARS-CoV-2 and validated it on protease from the tick-borne encephalitis virus to emphasize its versatility. The reaction progress is monitored as loss of FRET signal of the substrate. This robust and reproducible assay can be used for testing the inhibitors in 96- or 384-well plates.	Mechanism;Treatment
34212899	The necessity of early anti-inflammatory therapy initiation in cases with mild-to-moderate COVID-19: A personal experience from an attending pharmacist and his resident. I am a professor and attending pharmacist in the field of pharmaceutical sciences and writer or co-author of at least 5 manuscripts about different aspects of COVID-19. More than 15 months from the first report of COVID-19, over 120 million people all over the world infected by this virus, and more than 2.5 million of them have died. Although different treatment approaches have been proposed, management of the COVID-19 patients is steal remained controversial. In this regard, I want to share my personal experience from the exposure to the coronavirus and the consequence of this infection on my health status. I am a 51 years old male, known case of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. During working hours of colleagues in the Faculty of Pharmacy, I visited one of my colleagues in his office. After leaving the Faculty, my colleague declares that his RT-PCR test of COVID-19 is positive and it took 3 days for me to experience the first sign of the COVID-19 as fever. Many complications have occurred for me during the different stages of COVID-19 infection that I shared and explained in detail with the suggested pharmacotherapies. According to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection and my personal experience during COVID-19 infection, I want to emphasize the necessity of early initiation of anti-inflammatory agents including corticosteroids and colchicine in high-risk patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia who shows respiratory system involvement, in order to prevent progression to the severe and critical stages of this disease.

34198930	Why We Will Continue to Lose Our Battle with Cancers If We Do Not Stop Their Triggers from Environmental Pollution. Besides our current health concerns due to COVID-19, cancer is a longer-lasting and even more dramatic pandemic that affects almost a third of the human population worldwide. Most of the emphasis on its causes has been posed on genetic predisposition, chance, and wrong lifestyles (mainly, obesity and smoking). Moreover, our medical weapons against cancers have not improved too much during the last century, although research is in progress. Once diagnosed with a malignant tumour, we still rely on surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The main problem is that we have focused on fighting a difficult battle instead of preventing it by controlling its triggers. Quite the opposite, our knowledge of the links between environmental pollution and cancer has surged from the 1980s. Carcinogens in water, air, and soil have continued to accumulate disproportionally and grow in number and dose, bringing us to today's carnage. Here, a synthesis and critical review of the state of the knowledge of the links between cancer and environmental pollution in the three environmental compartments is provided, research gaps are briefly discussed, and some future directions are indicated. New evidence suggests that it is relevant to take into account not only the dose but also the time when we are exposed to carcinogens. The review ends by stressing that more dedication should be put into studying the environmental causes of cancers to prevent and avoid curing them, that the precautionary approach towards environmental pollutants must be much more reactionary, and that there is an urgent need to leave behind the outdated petrochemical-based industry and goods production.

34285741	New-onset restless leg syndrome in a COVID-19 patient: a case report with literature review. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a sleep disorder characterized by the sudden urge to move the lower limbs during periods of rest accompanied by an unpleasant sensation like tingling or burning in the legs. Often, this urge is partially relieved by the movement of legs. However, it causes disturbance of sleep leading to daytime fatigue. Herein, we present an unusual case of new-onset of restless leg syndrome in a COVID-19 infected patient who presented three weeks after an uncomplicated delivery via caesarean section. The patient was managed with sleep hygiene measures, oral iron and vitamin C tablets apart from general COVID-19 management medications, subsequently leading to significant improvements. Here we have discussed possible associated factors, pathophysiological mechanisms and management of RLS in the case of COVID infected individuals.	Case Report
34220507	Myricetin Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Viral Replication by Targeting M(pro) and Ameliorates Pulmonary Inflammation. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread widely around the world and has seriously affected the human health of tens of millions of people. In view of lacking anti-virus drugs target to SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need to develop effective new drugs. In this study, we reported our discovery of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors. We selected 15 natural compounds, including 7 flavonoids, 3 coumarins, 2 terpenoids, one henolic, one aldehyde and one steroid compound for molecular docking and enzymatic screening. Myricetin were identified to have potent inhibit activity with IC50 3.684 +/- 0.076 muM in the enzyme assay. The binding pose of Myricetin with SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) was identified using molecular docking method. In the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), the chromone ring of Myricetin interacts with His41 through pi-pi stacking, and the 3'-, 4'- and 7-hydroxyl of Myricetin interact with Phe140, Glu166and Asp187 through hydrogen bonds. Significantly, our results showed that Myricetin has potent effect on bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Overall, Myricetin may be a potential drug for anti-virus and symptomatic treatment of COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34223589	Corilagin and 1,3,6-Tri-O-galloy-beta-D-glucose: potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The COVID-19 disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, first detected in December 2019, is still emerging through virus mutations. Although almost under control in some countries due to effective vaccines that are mitigating the worldwide pandemic, the urgency to develop additional vaccines and therapeutic treatments is imperative. In this work, the natural polyphenols corilagin and 1,3,6-tri-O-galloy-beta-d-glucose (TGG) are investigated to determine the structural basis of inhibitor interactions as potential candidates to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into target cells. First, the therapeutic potential of the ligands are assessed on the ACE2/wild-type RBD. We first use molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics, to take into account the conformational flexibility that plays a significant role in ligand binding and that cannot be captured using only docking, and then analyze more precisely the affinity of these ligands using MMPBSA binding free energy. We show that both ligands bind to the ACE2/wild-type RBD interface with good affinities which might prevent the ACE2/RBD association. Second, we confirm the potency of these ligands to block the ACE2/RBD association using a combination of surface plasmon resonance and biochemical inhibition assays. These experiments confirm that TGG and, to a lesser extent, corilagin, inhibit the binding of RBD to ACE2. Both experiments and simulations show that the ligands interact preferentially with RBD, while weak binding is observed with ACE2, hence, avoiding potential physiological side-effects induced by the inhibition of ACE2. In addition to the wild-type RBD, we also study numerically three RBD mutations (E484K, N501Y and E484K/N501Y) found in the main SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns. We find that corilagin could be as effective for RBD/E484K but less effective for the RBD/N501Y and RBD/E484K-N501Y mutants, while TGG strongly binds at relevant locations to all three mutants, demonstrating the significant interest of these molecules as potential inhibitors for variants of SARS-CoV-2.

34219970	Development of an ultrasensitive fluorescent immunochromatographic assay based on multilayer quantum dot nanobead for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and influenza A virus. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and in fl uenza A virus (FluA) antigens in the early stages of virus infection is the key to control the epidemic spread. Here, we developed a two-channel fluorescent immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for ultrasensitive and simultaneous qualification of the two viruses in biological samples. A high-performance quantum dot nanobead (QB) was fabricated by adsorption of multilayers of dense quantum dots (QDs) onto the SiO2 surface and used as the highly luminescent label of the ICA system to ensure the high-sensitivity and stability of the assay. The combination of monodispersed SiO2 core ( approximately 180 nm) and numerous carboxylated QDs formed a hierarchical shell, which ensured that the QBs possessed excellent stability, superior fluorescence signal, and convenient surface functionalization. The developed ICA biosensor achieved simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 and FluA in one test within 15 min, with detection limits reaching 5 pg/mL for SARS-CoV-2 antigen and 50 pfu/mL for FluA H1N1. Moreover, our method showed high accuracy and specificity in throat swab samples with two orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared with traditional AuNP-based ICA method. Hence, the proposed method is a promising and convenient tool for detection of respiratory viruses.	Diagnosis
34284319	The reliability of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients: Insights on the diagnostic performance and utility for COVID-19 screening. Current literature has focused on testing saliva in symptomatic patients, and little information is available regarding saliva performance in asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We compared paired saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) collected from 33 symptomatic and 12 asymptomatic known SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Saliva had an overall sensitivity of 59%, a specificity of 95%, and a negative predictive value of 98%. Saliva demonstrated higher sensitivity in symptomatic (80%) vs. asymptomatic individuals (36%) (P = 0.006), and in high-risk (symptomatic, febrile and/or with comorbidities) (82%) vs. low-risk (asymptomatic, afebrile, and no comorbidities) (22%) patients (P = 0.0002). Cycle threshold (Ct) values in NPS specimens were higher in saliva-negative vs. saliva-positive cases (P = 0.02 and <0.001). Overall, these findings show that despite saliva's low sensitivity in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, it can detect infections with lower Ct values and a potentially higher chance of viral transmission. Additional studies are warranted to fully evaluate saliva as a screening test for coronavirus disease-2019.	Diagnosis
34352105	Misalignment between COVID-19 hotspots and clinical trial sites. Hundreds of interventional clinical trials have been launched in the United States to identify effective treatment strategies for combating the COVID-19 pandemic. However, to date, only a small fraction of these trials has completed enrollment, delaying the scientific investigation of COVID-19 and its treatment options. This study presents novel metrics to examine the geographic alignment between COVID-19 hotspots and interventional clinical trial sites and evaluate trial access over time during the evolving pandemic. Using temporal COVID-19 case data from USAFacts.org and trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov, US counties were categorized based on their numbers of cases and trials. Our analysis suggests that alignment and access have worsened as the pandemic shifted over time. We recommend strategies and metrics to evaluate the alignment between cases and trials. Future studies are warranted to investigate the impact of the misalignment of cases and clinical trial sites on clinical trial recruitment.	Prevention
34290821	Association of anemia and COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Aim: COVID-19 is a major threat to public health worldwide. A large proportion of COVID-19 patients is proved to develop anemia. Herein, we investigate the association between anemia and severe pneumonia. Materials & methods: 137 of COVID-19-confirmed patients admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) from 13 February to 17 March 2020 were included. Their clinical characteristics and laboratory data were studied, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: The anemic patients were less likely to develop fever in the early stage of COVID-19. Elevated IL-6 levels were found in anemic COVID-19 patients compared with those without anemia. COVID-19 patients with anemia had an 8.2 times greater possibility of developing severe pneumonia compared with their counterparts without anemia. Conclusion: This study comprehensively describes the clinical characteristics of anemic patients with ordinary, severe and critical COVID-19 and demonstrates the close relationship between the anemia and severe COVID-19.

34222108	Olfactory Dysfunction in Patients Infected with 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Introduction: The current study aimed at investigating the occurrence and features of olfactory dysfunction in patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Materials and Methods: Patients with laboratory and clinically confirmed COVID-19 infection were enrolled in this longitudinal study. They were managed in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. The demographic, clinical, and outcome data were retrieved from patients' medical records. Olfactory dysfunction features, including the onset pattern, duration, and recovery time were investigated. The visual analog scale (VAS) was utilized as a self-rating subjective measurement of olfactory function. Results: According to the results, the mean age of the patients (n=502) was obtained at 46.8+/-18.5 years; moreover, 52.4% and 47.6% of cases were female and male, respectively. It was also revealed that 35.4% and 64.5% of the subjects were outpatients and hospitalized, respectively. Based on the findings, 178 (38.4%) subjects had olfactory dysfunction. The mean values of VAS in hyposmic patients were estimated at 2.5+/-2.5, 8.3 +/-2.1, and 9.4+/-1.6 at the first evaluation, in 2 weeks, and after 1 month of follow-up (P<0.001). The onset of olfactory dysfunction was more suddenly (58.7%). The majority of cases experienced olfactory dysfunction at the same time as other symptoms 72(51.1%). Based on the results, 0.4% of subjects infected with COVID-19 had olfactory dysfunction as an isolated symptom. The olfactory dysfunction was recovered after 2 weeks in 18 (25.3%) anosmic and 37(46.8%) hyposmic patients. Conclusion: Olfactory dysfunction seemed to be an important symptom of COVID-19 infection. The occurrence of this disturbance as a transient self-limited condition was significantly higher among female subjects.	Diagnosis
34348638	Reviewing Antiviral Research Against Viruses Causing Human Diseases - A Structure Guided Approach. The littlest of all the pathogens, viruses have continuously been the foremost strange microorganisms to consider. Viral Infections can cause extreme sicknesses as archived by the HIV/AIDS widespread or the later Ebola or Zika episodes. Apprehensive framework distortions are too regularly watched results of numerous viral contaminations. Besides, numerous infections are oncoviruses, which can trigger different sorts of cancer. Nearly every year a modern infection species rises debilitating the world populace with an annihilating episode. Subsequently, the need of creating antivirals to combat such rising infections. In any case, from the innovation of to begin with antiviral medicate Idoxuridine in 1962 to the revelation of Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) that was FDA-approved in 2018, the hone of creating antivirals has changed significantly. In this article, different auxiliary science strategies have been described that can be referral for therapeutics innovation.	Treatment
34210968	The antiandrogen enzalutamide downregulates TMPRSS2 and reduces cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells. SARS-CoV-2 attacks various organs, most destructively the lung, and cellular entry requires two host cell surface proteins: ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Downregulation of one or both of these is thus a potential therapeutic approach for COVID-19. TMPRSS2 is a known target of the androgen receptor, a ligand-activated transcription factor; androgen receptor activation increases TMPRSS2 levels in various tissues, most notably prostate. We show here that treatment with the antiandrogen enzalutamide-a well-tolerated drug widely used in advanced prostate cancer-reduces TMPRSS2 levels in human lung cells and in mouse lung. Importantly, antiandrogens significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in lung cells. In support of this experimental data, analysis of existing datasets shows striking co-expression of AR and TMPRSS2, including in specific lung cell types targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Together, the data presented provides strong evidence to support clinical trials to assess the efficacy of antiandrogens as a treatment option for COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34217121	Evaluation of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in utero: Nine pregnant women and their newborns. INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), mainly transmitted by droplets and close contact, has caused a pandemic worldwide as of March 2020. According to the current case reports and cohort studies, the symptoms of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to normal adults and may cause a series of adverse consequences of pregnancy (placental abruption, fetal distress, epilepsy during pregnancy, etc.). However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to the fetus through the placental barrier is still a focus of debate. METHODS: In this study, in order to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect fetus through the placental barrier, we performed qualitative detection of virus structural protein (spike protein and nucleoprotein) and targeted receptor protein Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), Basigin (CD147) and molecular chaperone GRP78 expression on the placental tissue of seven pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 through immunohistochemistry. Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and breastmilk samples were collected immediately in the operating room or delivery room for verification after delivery, which were all tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS/DISCUSSION: The result showed that CD147 was expressed on the basal side of the chorionic trophoblast cell membrane and ACE2 was expressed on the maternal side, while GRP78 was strongly expressed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. The RT-PCR results of Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and breastmilk samples were all negative. On the basis of these findings, we speculated that it may be due to the placental barrier between mother and baby, for example, villous matrix and interstitial blood vessels have low expression of virus-related receptors (ACE2, CD147, GRP78), the probability of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the placenta is low.

34218488	A review of the antiviral activity of Chitosan, including patented applications and its potential use against COVID-19. Chitosan is an abundant organic polysaccharide, which can be relatively easily obtained by chemical modification of animal or fungal source materials. Chitosan and its derivatives have been shown to exhibit direct antiviral activity, to be useful vaccine adjuvants and to have potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. This thorough and timely review looks at the recent history of investigations into the role of chitosan and its derivatives as an antiviral agent and proposes a future application in the treatment of endemic SARS-CoV-2.

34199937	Time-Variant Positive Air Pressure in Drainage Stacks as a Pathogen Transmission Pathway of COVID-19. Time-variant positive air pressure in a drainage stack poses a risk of pathogenic virus transmission into a habitable space, however, the excessive risk and its significance have not yet been sufficiently addressed for drainage system designs. This study proposes a novel measure for the probable pathogenic virus transmission risk of a high-rise drainage stack with the occurrence of positive air pressure. The proposed approach is based on time-variant positive air pressures measured in a 38 m high drainage stack of a full-scale experimental tower under steady flow conditions of flow rate 1-4 Ls(-1) discharging at a height between 15 m to 33 m above the stack base. The maximum pressure and probabilistic positive air pressures in the discharging stack ventilation section with no water (Zone A of the discharging drainage stack) were determined. It was demonstrated that the positive air pressures were lower in frequency as compared with those in other stack zones and could propagate along the upper 1/3 portion of the ventilation pipe (H' >/= 0.63) towards the ventilation opening at the rooftop. As the probabilistic positive pressures at a stack height were found to be related to the water discharging height and flow rate, a risk model of positive air pressure is proposed. Taking the 119th, 124th, 140th and 11,547th COVID-19 cases of an epidemiological investigation in Hong Kong as a baseline of concern, excessive risk of system overuse was evaluated. The results showed that for a 20-80% increase in the frequency of discharge flow rate, the number of floors identified at risk increased from 1 to 9 and 1 to 6 in the 34- and 25-storey residential buildings, respectively. The outcome can apply to facilities planning for self-quarantine arrangements in high-rise buildings where pathogenic virus transmission associated with drainage system overuse is a concern.

34213527	Frequency of Thrombocytopenia and Platelet Factor 4/Heparin Antibodies in Patients With Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Importance: Cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia have recently been reported within 4 to 28 days of vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (AstraZeneca/Oxford) and Ad.26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccines. An immune-mediated response associated with platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies has been proposed as the underlying pathomechanism. Objective: To determine the frequencies of admission thrombocytopenia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and presence of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies in patients diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a descriptive analysis of a retrospective sample of consecutive patients diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis between January 1987 and March 2018 from 7 hospitals participating in the International Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Consortium from Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Mexico, Iran, and Costa Rica. Of 952 patients, 865 with available baseline platelet count were included. In a subset of 93 patients, frozen plasma samples collected during a previous study between September 2009 and February 2016 were analyzed for the presence of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies. Exposures: Diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Frequencies of admission thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 x103/muL), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (as diagnosed by the treating physician), and platelet factor 4/heparin IgG antibodies (optical density >0.4, in a subset of patients with previously collected plasma samples). Results: Of 865 patients (median age, 40 years [interquartile range, 29-53 years], 70% women), 73 (8.4%; 95% CI, 6.8%-10.5%) had thrombocytopenia, which was mild (100-149 x103/muL) in 52 (6.0%), moderate (50-99 x103/muL) in 17 (2.0%), and severe (<50 x103/muL) in 4 (0.5%). Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies was diagnosed in a single patient (0.1%; 95% CI, <0.1%-0.7%). Of the convenience sample of 93 patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis included in the laboratory analysis, 8 (9%) had thrombocytopenia, and none (95% CI, 0%-4%) had platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies. Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, baseline thrombocytopenia was uncommon, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies were rare. These findings may inform investigations of the possible association between the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccines and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia.

34228727	The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on waiting times for elective surgery patients: A multicenter study. BACKGROUND: A concern has been that health care reorganizations during the first COVID-19 wave have led to delays in elective surgeries, resulting in increased complications and even mortality. This multicenter study examined the changes in waiting times of elective surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. METHODS: Data on elective surgery were gathered from three Finnish public hospitals for years 2017-2020. Surgery incidence and waiting times were examined and the year 2020 was compared to the reference years 2017-2019. The mean annual, monthly, and weekly waiting times were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The most common diagnosis groups were examined separately. FINDINGS: A total of 88 693 surgeries were included during the study period. The mean waiting time in 2020 was 92.6 (CI 91.5-93.8) days, whereas the mean waiting time in the reference years was 85.8 (CI 85.1-86.5) days, resulting in an average 8% increase in waiting times in 2020. Elective procedure incidence decreased rapidly in the onset of the first COVID-19 wave in March 2020 but recovered in May and June, after which the surgery incidence was 22% higher than in the reference years and remained at this level until the end of the year. In May 2020 and thereafter until November, waiting times were longer with monthly increases varying between 7% and 34%. In gastrointestinal and genitourinary diseases and neoplasms, waiting times were longer in 2020. In cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases, waiting times were shorter in 2020. CONCLUSION: The health care reorganizations due to the pandemic have increased elective surgery waiting times by as much as one-third, even though the elective surgery rate increased by one-fifth after the lockdown.

34290932	Targeted Minimal Staff-to-Patient Ratios Are Unachievable - A Nationwide Survey in German ICUs During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Introduction Adequate staffing in the intensive care units (ICUs) is the most important factor to provide optimal care and ensure favorable outcomes in critically ill patients. Recently, the need for ICU beds has reached unprecedented levels and the management and treatment of critically ill patients has been in focus. The aim of the study was to assess the targeted and actual nurse-to-patient (NPR) and physician-to-patient ratios (PPR) regarding patients with and without COVID-19. Methods We conducted a nationwide online survey assessing the standard of care in German ICUs treating patients with COVID-19. We asked questions regarding targeted PPR and NPR and their implementation in daily clinical practice to heads of German ICU departments. Results We received 244 responses of which 171 were eligible for final analysis. Targeted median PPR ratio was 8 [interquartile range (IQR) = 4] and targeted NPR was 2 (IQR = 1). For COVID-19 patients, the median targeted PPR was 6 (IQR = 2) and the median targeted NPR was 2 (IQR = 0). Targeted PPRs were rarely met by 15.2% and never met by 3.5% of responding institutions. Targeted NPRs were rarely met in 32.2% and never in 5.3% of responding institutions. Conclusion In contrast to PPR, targeted NPRs were largely unattainable in German ICUs. Our results raise concern in view of studies linking worse outcomes in critically ill patients to suboptimal NPRs. This warrants further health policy efforts regarding optimal staffing in the ICU.

34216124	Chest Computed Tomography Severity Score to Predict Adverse Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to wreak havoc worldwide. This study assessed the ability of chest computed tomography (CT) severity score (CSS) to predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 192 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia aged more than 20 years and typical CT findings and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction positive admitted in a tertiary hospital were included. Clinical symptoms at admission and short-term outcome were obtained. A semi-quantitative scoring system was used to evaluate the parenchymal involvement. The association between CSS, disease severity, and outcomes were evaluated. Prediction of CSS was assessed with the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The incidence of admission to ICU was 22.8% in men and 14.1% in women. CSS was related to ICU admission and mortality. Areas under the ROC curves were 0.764 for total CSS. Using a stepwise binary logistic regression model, gender, age, oxygen saturation, and CSS had a significant independent relationship with ICU admission and death. Patients with CSS >/=12.5 had about four-time risk of ICU admission and death (odds ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.66 - 9.25). The multivariate regression analysis showed the superiority of CSS over other clinical information and co-morbidities. CONCLUSION: CSS was a strong predictor of progression to ICU admission and death and there was a substantial role of non-contrast chest CT imaging in the presence of typical features for COVID-19 pneumonia as a reliable predictor of clinical severity and patient's outcome.

34204383	Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection at the University of Barcelona during the Third COVID-19 Pandemic Wave in Spain. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic started in December 2019 and still is a major global health challenge. Lockdown measures and social distancing sparked a global shift towards online learning, which deeply impacted universities' daily life, and the University of Barcelona (UB) was not an exception. Accordingly, we aimed to determine the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic at the UB. To that end, we performed a cross-sectional study on a sample of 2784 UB members (n = 52,529). Participants answered a brief, ad hoc, online epidemiological questionnaire and provided a nasal swab for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 analysis and a venous blood sample for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assay. Total prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR or positive IgG) was 14.9% (95%CI 13.3 to 17.0%). Forty-four participants (1.6%, 95%CI: 1.2-2.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was observed in 12.8% (95%CI: 11.6-14.1%) of participants. Overall, while waiting for population vaccination and/or increased herd immunity, we should concentrate on identifying and isolating new cases and their contacts.	Prevention
34208052	Cardio-Cerebral Infarction, Free-Floating Thrombosis and Hyperperfusion in COVID-19. Cardio-cerebral infarction, which refers to an acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) that occur concurrently, is an uncommon phenomenon with a grave prognosis. Intraluminal carotid thrombus (ICT) is an infrequently encountered cause of ischemic stroke and can be associated with an underlying hypercoagulable state. One severe yet prevalent complication of infection with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is thrombosis from multi-pathway inflammatory responses. Here, we present a unique case of cardio-cerebral infarction, with a free-floating intraluminal thrombus in the left internal carotid artery, in the setting of recent COVID-19 infection, and with the etiology of both events attributed to a COVID-19 hypercoagulable state. CT perfusion imaging also showed an interesting imaging finding of hyperperfusion, which is believed to be a form of dysfunctional cerebral autoregulation.	Case Report
34225545	Antimicrobial resistance in low- and middle-income countries: current status and future directions. Introduction: Rising rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) globally continue to pose agrave threat to human health. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected, partly due to the high burden of communicable diseases.Areas covered: We reviewed current trends in AMR in LMICs and examined the forces driving AMR in those regions. The state of interventions being undertaken to curb AMR across the developing world are discussed, and the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on those efforts is explored.Expert opinion: The dynamics that drive AMR in LMICs are inseparable from the political, economic, socio-cultural, and environmental forces that shape these nations. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated underlying factors that increase AMR. Some progress is being made in implementing surveillance measures in LMICs, but implementation of concrete measures to meaningfully impact AMR rates must address the underlying structural issues that generate and promote AMR. This, in turn, will require large infrastructural investments and significant political will.	Prevention
34207362	Genome-Wide Analysis of Codon Usage Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 Virus Reveals Global Heterogeneity of COVID-19. The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease COVID-19 is significantly implicated by global heterogeneity in the genome organization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The causative agents of global heterogeneity in the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 are not well characterized due to the lack of comparative study of a large enough sample size from around the globe to reduce the standard deviation to the acceptable margin of error. To better understand the SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of codon usage bias of sixty (60) strains to get a snapshot of its global heterogeneity. Our study shows a relatively low codon usage bias in the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome globally, with nearly all the over-preferred codons' A.U. ended. We concluded that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is primarily shaped by mutation pressure; however, marginal selection pressure cannot be overlooked. Within the A/U rich virus genomes of SARS-CoV-2, the standard deviation in G.C. (42.91% +/- 5.84%) and the GC3 value (30.14% +/- 6.93%) points towards global heterogeneity of the virus. Several SARS-CoV-2 viral strains were originated from different viral lineages at the exact geographic location also supports this fact. Taking all together, these findings suggest that the general root ancestry of the global genomes are different with different genome's level adaptation to host. This research may provide new insights into the codon patterns, host adaptation, and global heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2.	Mechanism
34208928	Seleno-Functionalization of Quercetin Improves the Non-Covalent Inhibition of M(pro) and Its Antiviral Activity in Cells against SARS-CoV-2. The development of new antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 is a valuable long-term strategy to protect the global population from the COVID-19 pandemic complementary to the vaccination. Considering this, the viral main protease (M(pro)) is among the most promising molecular targets in light of its importance during the viral replication cycle. The natural flavonoid quercetin 1 has been recently reported to be a potent M(pro) inhibitor in vitro, and we explored the effect produced by the introduction of organoselenium functionalities in this scaffold. In particular, we report here a new synthetic method to prepare previously inaccessible C-8 seleno-quercetin derivatives. By screening a small library of flavonols and flavone derivatives, we observed that some compounds inhibit the protease activity in vitro. For the first time, we demonstrate that quercetin (1) and 8-(p-tolylselenyl)quercetin (2d) block SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected cells at non-toxic concentrations, with an IC50 of 192 muM and 8 muM, respectively. Based on docking experiments driven by experimental evidence, we propose a non-covalent mechanism for M(pro) inhibition in which a hydrogen bond between the selenium atom and Gln189 residue in the catalytic pocket could explain the higher M(pro) activity of 2d and, as a result, its better antiviral profile.

34343179	Diabetes increases the risk of COVID-19 in an altitude dependent manner: An analysis of 1,280,806 Mexican patients. AIMS: The objective of this study is to analyze how the impact of Diabetes Mellitus [DM] in patients with COVID-19 varies according to altitudinal gradient. METHODS: We obtained 1,280,806 records from adult patients with COVID-19 and DM to analyze the probability of COVID-19, development of COVID-19 pneumonia, hospitalization, intubation, admission to the Intensive Care Unit [ICU] and case-fatality rates [CFR]. Variables were controlled by age, sex and altitude of residence to calculate adjusted prevalence and prevalence ratios. RESULTS: Patients with DM had a 21.8% higher prevalence of COVID-19 and an additional 120.2% higher prevalence of COVID-19 pneumonia. The adjusted prevalence was also higher for these outcomes as well as for hospitalization, intubation and ICU admission. COVID-19 and pneumonia patients with DM had a 97.0% and 19.4% higher CFR, respectively. With increasing altitudes, the probability of being a confirmed COVID-19 case and the development of pneumonia decreased along CFR for patients with and without DM. However, COVID-19 patients with DM were more likely to require intubation when residing at high altitude. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that patients with DM have a higher probability of being a confirmed COVID-19 case and developing pneumonia. Higher altitude had a protective relationship against SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, it may be associated with more severe cases in patients with and without DM. High altitude decreases CFR for all COVID-19 patients. Our work also shows that women are less affected than men regardless of altitude.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34285082	Quantifying COVID-19 importation risk in a dynamic network of domestic cities and international countries. Since its outbreak in December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to 191 countries and caused millions of deaths. Many countries have experienced multiple epidemic waves and faced containment pressures from both domestic and international transmission. In this study, we conduct a multiscale geographic analysis of the spread of COVID-19 in a policy-influenced dynamic network to quantify COVID-19 importation risk under different policy scenarios using evidence from China. Our spatial dynamic panel data (SDPD) model explicitly distinguishes the effects of travel flows from the effects of transmissibility within cities, across cities, and across national borders. We find that within-city transmission was the dominant transmission mechanism in China at the beginning of the outbreak and that all domestic transmission mechanisms were muted or significantly weakened before importation posed a threat. We identify effective containment policies by matching the change points of domestic and importation transmissibility parameters to the timing of various interventions. Our simulations suggest that importation risk is limited when domestic transmission is under control, but that cumulative cases would have been almost 13 times higher if domestic transmissibility had resurged to its precontainment level after importation and 32 times higher if domestic transmissibility had remained at its precontainment level since the outbreak. Our findings provide practical insights into infectious disease containment and call for collaborative and coordinated global suppression efforts.	Prevention;Transmission
34212944	A critical overview of computational approaches employed for COVID-19 drug discovery. COVID-19 has resulted in huge numbers of infections and deaths worldwide and brought the most severe disruptions to societies and economies since the Great Depression. Massive experimental and computational research effort to understand and characterize the disease and rapidly develop diagnostics, vaccines, and drugs has emerged in response to this devastating pandemic and more than 130 000 COVID-19-related research papers have been published in peer-reviewed journals or deposited in preprint servers. Much of the research effort has focused on the discovery of novel drug candidates or repurposing of existing drugs against COVID-19, and many such projects have been either exclusively computational or computer-aided experimental studies. Herein, we provide an expert overview of the key computational methods and their applications for the discovery of COVID-19 small-molecule therapeutics that have been reported in the research literature. We further outline that, after the first year the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears that drug repurposing has not produced rapid and global solutions. However, several known drugs have been used in the clinic to cure COVID-19 patients, and a few repurposed drugs continue to be considered in clinical trials, along with several novel clinical candidates. We posit that truly impactful computational tools must deliver actionable, experimentally testable hypotheses enabling the discovery of novel drugs and drug combinations, and that open science and rapid sharing of research results are critical to accelerate the development of novel, much needed therapeutics for COVID-19.

34362133	SARS-CoV-2 and Acute Cerebrovascular Events: An Overview. Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, accumulating evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with various neurological manifestations, including acute cerebrovascular events (i.e., stroke and cerebral venous thrombosis). These events can occur prior to, during and even after the onset of COVID-19's general symptoms. Although the mechanisms underlying the cerebrovascular complications in patients with COVID-19 are yet to be fully elucidated, the hypercoagulability state, inflammation and altered angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) signaling in association with SARS-CoV-2 may play key roles. ACE-2 plays a critical role in preserving heart and brain homeostasis. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge of the possible mechanisms underlying the acute cerebrovascular events in patients with COVID-19, and we review the current epidemiological studies and case reports of neurovascular complications in association with SARS-CoV-2, as well as the relevant therapeutic approaches that have been considered worldwide. As the number of published COVID-19 cases with cerebrovascular events is growing, prospective studies would help gather more valuable insights into the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular events, effective therapies, and the factors predicting poor functional outcomes related to such events in COVID-19 patients.

34334894	Vaccination status and COVID-19 related mortality: A hospital based cross sectional study. Background: Efficacy of vaccines studied in clinical trial settings are likely to be different from their effectiveness in a real-world scenario. Indian Armed Forces launched its vaccine drive against COVID-19 on 16 Jan 2021. This study evaluated the effect of vaccination on mortality amongst hospitalized COVID patients. Methods: A cross sectional study was done on all admitted moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at a designated COVID hospital in New Delhi. The primary outcome assessed the association of being fully vaccinated with mortality. Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) (with 95% CI) was performed for each predictor. Logistic regression was used for multivariable analysis and adjusted odds ratios obtained. Results: The 1168 patients included in the study had a male preponderance with a mean age of 54.6 (+/- 17.51) years. A total of 266 (23%) patients were partially vaccinated with COVISHIELD(R) and 184 (16%) were fully vaccinated. Overall, 518 (44.3%) patients had comorbidities and 332 (28.4%) died. Among those fully vaccinated, there was 12.5% (23/184) mortality while it was 31.45 % (309/984) among the unvaccinated (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.5, p<0.0001). In a logistic regression model, complete vaccination status and younger age were found to be associated with survival. Conclusions: Vaccination with two doses of COVISHIELD(R) was associated with lower odds of mortality among hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34364972	Lifestyle-mediated nitric oxide boost to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection: A perspective. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide and has seriously threatened public health by causing significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with preexisting endothelial dysfunction caused by aging, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity are at high risk for life-threatening thromboembolic complications. This suggests a possibility that reduced endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production and NO bioavailability could be a common underlying pathology for the progression of COVID-19. Increasingly, evidence from experimental and clinical studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection shows that NO inhibits the pathogenesis of COVID-19, including virus entry into host cells, viral replication, host immune response, and subsequent thromboembolic complications. Restoring NO bioavailability may have the potential to be a preventive or early-treatment option for COVID-19. This review aims to provide in-depth discussion of NO bioavailability to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly by focusing on lifestyle factors such as nitrate-rich diets, physical exercise, and nasal breathing, which could be easily performed on a daily basis to boost NO bioavailability.

34199134	Effect of Aprotinin and Avifavir((R)) Combination Therapy for Moderate COVID-19 Patients. COVID-19 is a contagious multisystem inflammatory disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied the efficacy of Aprotinin (nonspecific serine proteases inhibitor) in combination with Avifavir((R)) or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) drugs, which are recommended by the Russian Ministry of Health for the treatment therapy of moderate COVID-19 patients. This prospective single-center study included participants with moderate COVID-19-related pneumonia, laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and admitted to the hospitals. Patients received combinations of intravenous (IV) Aprotinin (1,000,000 KIU daily, 3 days) and HCQ (cohort 1), inhalation (inh) treatment with Aprotinin (625 KIU four times per day, 5 days) and HCQ (cohort 2) or IV Aprotinin (1,000,000 KIU daily for 5 days) and Avifavir (cohort 3). In cohorts 1-3, the combination therapy showed 100% efficacy in preventing the transfer of patients (n = 30) to the intensive care unit (ICU). The effect of the combination therapy in cohort 3 was the most prominent, and the median time to SARS-CoV-2 elimination was 3.5 days (IQR 3.0-4.0), normalization of the CRP concentration was 3.5 days (IQR 3-5), of the D-dimer concentration was 5 days (IQR 4 to 5); body temperature was 1 day (IQR 1-3), improvement in clinical status or discharge from the hospital was 5 days (IQR 5-5), and improvement in lung lesions of patients on 14 day was 100%.

34227783	Hypokalaemic Paralysis Associated with COVID-19 Infection. Introduction: COVID-19 is a pandemic affecting mainly respiratory and gastrointestinal system. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) resulting in hypokalaemia. We hereby report the a of hypokalaemic paralysis induced by COVID-19. Case: A 56 years old male with no co-morbidities presented with fever (2days), weakness in bilateral lower limbs (1 day). His had severe hypokalaemia with serum potassium of 2.05 mEq/L. RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV- 19 was positive. He was diagnosed as a case of hypokalaemic paralysis induced by COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: We suggest that during this pandemic era if a COVID-19 patient presents with paralysis, hypokalaemia induced paralysis should be kept in the differential diagnosis. What is known: COVID-19 infection leads to hypokalemia. What is new: Hypokalaemic paralysis as a manifestation of COVID-19.	Case Report
34291810	Near real-time observation reveals increased prevalence of young patients in the ICU during the emerging third SARS-CoV-2 wave in Switzerland. AIMS OF THE STUDY: During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the launch of a large-scale vaccination campaign and virus mutations have hinted at possible changes in transmissibility and the virulence affecting disease progression up to critical illness, and carry potential for future vaccination failure. To monitor disease development over time with respect to critically ill COVID-19 patients, we report near real-time prospective observational data from the RISC-19-ICU registry that indicate changed characteristics of critically ill patients admitted to Swiss intensive care units (ICUs) at the onset of a third pandemic wave. METHODS: 1829 of 3344 critically ill COVID-19 patients enrolled in the international RISC-19-ICU registry as of 31 May 2021 were treated in Switzerland and were included in the present study. Of these, 1690 patients were admitted to the ICU before 1 February 2021 and were compared with 139 patients admitted during the emerging third pandemic wave RESULTS: Third wave patients were a mean of 5.2 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.2&ndash;7.1) younger (median 66.0 years, interquartile range [IQR] 57.0&ndash;73.0 vs 62.0 years, IQR 54.5&ndash;68.0; p &lt;0.0001) and had a higher body mass index than patients admitted in the previous pandemic period. They presented with lower SAPS II and APACHE II scores, less need for circulatory support and lower white blood cell counts at ICU admission. P/F ratio was similar, but a 14% increase in ventilatory ratio was observed over time (p = 0.03) CONCLUSION: Near real-time registry data show that the latest COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs in Switzerland at the onset of the third wave were on average 5 years younger, had a higher body mass index, and presented with lower physiological risk scores but a trend towards more severe lung failure. These differences may primarily be related to the ongoing nationwide vaccination campaign, but the possibility that changes in virus-host interactions may be a co-factor in the age shift and change in disease characteristics is cause for concern, and should be taken into account in the public health and vaccination strategy during the ongoing pandemic.

34342734	The Care of the Leukemic Patients in Times of SARS-CoV-2. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), has significantly derailed cancer care. Patients with leukemia are more likely to have severe infection and increased rates of mortality. There is paucity of information on how to modify care of leukemia patients in view of the COVID-19 risks and imposed restrictions. We review the available literature on the impact of COVID-19 on different types of leukemia patients and suggest general as well as disease-specific recommendations on care based on available evidence. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 infection impacts leukemia subtypes in variable ways and the standard treatments for leukemia have similarly, varying effects on the course of COVID-19 infection. Useful treatment strategies include deferring treatment when possible, use of less intensive regimens, outpatient targeted oral agents requiring minimal monitoring, and prioritization of curative or life-prolonging strategies. Reducing health care encounters, rational transfusion standards, just resource allocation, and pre-emptive advance care planning will serve the interests of leukemia patients. Ad hoc modifications based on expert opinions and extrapolations of previous well-designed studies are the way forward to navigate the crisis. This should be supplanted with more rigorous prospective evidence.	Prevention
34226867	Screening for Olfactory Dysfunction in COVID-19 Patients Using Quick Smell Identification Test. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of OD in the confirmed case with COVID-19 among our population using quick smell identification test (Q-SIT) as screening tool. METHODS: Cross- sectional study carried out in Qatif area-Saudi Arabia among adult hospitalized patient with confirm COVID-19 during the period between May and July, 2020. All adults confirmed COVID-19 patients were interviewed for history of current disease and associated symptoms as well as performing Q-SIT. Participants who had history of olfactory dysfunction, and critical cases required ICU admission were excluded. RESULTS: The prevalence of OD among COVID-19 cases was (16.3%) in our population using Q-SIT compared to (27.4%) for self-reported symptom. Females were having higher prevalence in compare to males (30.5% and 11.1%) respectively; which was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The patients reported higher prevalence of ageusia (31.9%) with significant association with OD (P < 0.001). Q-SIT showed high positive and negative predictive value in detecting OD among patients with COVID-19 (84% and 93% respectively). CONCLUSION: Q-SIT is a useful, validated and easy to apply tool for screening OD among patients with COVID-19. Some patients presented solely with this symptom which can occurs unnoticed in COVID-19 patients, and there for required objective test for detection.	Diagnosis
34201144	National Trends in Cycling in Light of the Norwegian Bike Traffic Index. National and international strategies and recommendations are intended to increase physical activity in the general population. Active transportation is included in interdisciplinary strategies to meet these recommendations. Cycling seems to be more health enhancing than walking for transportation since cycling seems to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and associated risk factors. Furthermore, the health benefits of cycling are proven to outrun the risk of injuries and mortality. Politicians seem to approve costly infrastructure strategies to increase the amount of cycling in the population to improve public health and shift to more sustainable travel habits. A linear relationship between cycle-friendly infrastructure and the amount of commuter cycling has been demonstrated. However, in Norway and on a global level, there is a lack of robust evaluations of actions and sensitive monitoring systems to observe possible change. Therefore, we aimed to develop the Norwegian bike traffic index and describe the national, regional, and local trends in counted cycle trips. We used a transparent methodology so that the index can be used, developed, and adapted in other countries. We included 89 stationary counters from the whole country. Counters monitored cycling from 2018 onward. The index is organized at local, regional, and national levels. Furthermore, the index is adjusted for population density at the counter level and presented as ratio of counted cycle trips, comparing 2018 to subsequent years. The index is presented as a percentage change with 95% confidence intervals. In Norway, counted cycle trips increased by 11% from 2018 (100, 100-100) to 2020 (111.0, 106.2-115.1), with large geographical differences. In Southern Norway, there was a significant increase of 23%, and in Northern Norway, there was a nonsignificant decrease by 8% from 2018 to 2020. The indices may indicate possible related effects of local to national cycling strategies and how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected Norwegian travel habits in urban areas.	Prevention
34203592	Detection of Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses in Miniopterus fuliginosus and Rousettus leschenaultii, two species of Sri Lankan Bats. Bats are known to be potential reservoirs of numerous human-pathogenic viruses. They have been identified as natural hosts for coronaviruses, causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in humans. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 interest in the prevalence of coronaviruses in bats was newly raised. In this study we investigated different bat species living in a sympatric colony in the Wavul Galge cave (Koslanda, Sri Lanka). In three field sessions (in 2018 and 2019), 395 bats were captured (Miniopterus, Rousettus, Hipposideros and Rhinolophus spp.) and either rectal swabs or fecal samples were collected. From these overall 396 rectal swab and fecal samples, the screening for coronaviruses with nested PCR resulted in 33 positive samples, 31 of which originated from Miniopterus fuliginosus and two from Rousettus leschenaultii. Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the obtained 384-nt fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase revealed that the examined M. fuliginosus bats excrete alphacoronaviruses and the examined R. leschenaultii bats excrete betacoronaviruses. Despite the sympatric roosting habitat, the coronaviruses showed host specificity and seemed to be limited to one species. Our results represent an important basis to better understand the prevalence of coronaviruses in Sri Lankan bats and may provide a basis for pursuing studies on particular bat species of interest.

34358130	Antibodies Responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a Large Cohort of Vaccinated Subjects and Seropositive Patients. COVID-19 is a current global threat, and the characterization of antibody response is vitally important to update vaccine development and strategies. In this study we assessed SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (N = 272) and subjects vaccinated with the BNT162b2 m-RNA COVID-19 vaccine (N = 1256). For each participant, socio-demographic data, COVID-19 vaccination records, serological analyses, and SARS-CoV-2 infection status were collected. IgG antibodies against S1/S2 antigens of SARS-CoV-2 were detected. Almost all vaccinated subjects (99.8%) showed a seropositivity to anti-SARS-COV-2 IgG and more than 80% of vaccinated subjects had IgG concentrations > 200 AU/mL. In a Tobit multivariable regression analysis, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was statistically significantly associated with increased IgG concentrations (beta coef = 266.4; p < 0.001). A statistically significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations was found with older age (beta coef = -1.96 per year increase; p < 0.001), male sex (beta coef = -22.3; p < 0.001), and days after immunization (beta coef = -1.67 per day increase; p < 0.001). Our findings could support the vaccination campaigns confirming the high immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine under investigation with respect to the natural infection. Further studies will be required for evaluating the role of age and days after immunization in the persistence of vaccine antibodies and protection from the disease.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34226815	Risk Assessment of Infection by Airborne Droplets and Aerosols at Different Levels of Cardiovascular Activity. Since end of 2019 the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is threatening humanity. Despite the fact that various scientists across the globe try to shed a light on this new respiratory disease, it is not yet fully understood. Unlike many studies on the geographical spread of the pandemic, including the study of external transmission routes, this work focuses on droplet and aerosol transport and their deposition inside the human airways. For this purpose, a digital replica of the human airways is used and particle transport under various levels of cardiovascular activity in enclosed spaces is studied by means of computational fluid dynamics. The influence of the room size, where the activity takes place, and the aerosol concentration is studied. The contribution aims to assess the risk of various levels of exercising while inhaling infectious pathogens to gain further insights in the deposition behavior of aerosols in the human airways. The size distribution of the expiratory droplets or aerosols plays a crucial role for the disease onset and progression. As the size of the expiratory droplets and aerosols differs for various exhaling scenarios, reported experimental particle size distributions are taken into account when setting up the environmental conditions. To model the aerosol deposition we employ OpenFOAM by using an Euler-Lagrangian frame including Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes resolved turbulent flow. Within this study, the effects of different exercise levels and thus breathing rates as well as particle size distributions and room sizes are investigated to enable new insights into the local particle deposition in the human airway and virus loads. A general observation can be made that exercising at higher levels of activity is increasing the risk to develop a severe cause of the COVID-19 disease due to the increased aerosolized volume that reaches into the lower airways, thus the knowledge of the inhaled particle dynamics in the human airways at various exercising levels provides valuable information for infection control strategies.

34220279	A co-design of clinical virtual care pathways to engage and support families requiring neonatal intensive care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (COVES study). Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, family presence restrictions in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) were enacted to limit disease transmission. This has resulted in communication challenges, negatively impacting family integrated care. Aim: To develop clinical care pathways to ensure optimal neonatal care to support families in response to parental presence restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An agile, co-design process utilizing expert consensus of a large interdisciplinary team and focus groups and semi-structured interviews with families and HCPs were used to co-design clinical virtual care pathways. Results: Three clinical virtual care pathways were co-designed: (1) building and maintaining relationships between family and healthcare providers; (2) awareness of resources; and (3) standardized COVID-19 messaging. Modifications were made to optimize uptake and utilization in the clinical areas. Conclusion: Clinical care virtual pathways were successfully co-designed to meet these needs to ensure more equitable family centered care.	Prevention
34210653	Impact of the pandemic on surgical activity in colorectal cancer in Spain. Results of a national survey. INTRODUCTION: The pandemic has had an impact on colorectal cancer surgery in hospitals. In 2020, up to 75% of colorectal cancer patients are estimated to require surgery. No objective data on the impact of the pandemic on the management of surgical waiting lists is available. We conducted a survey in colorectal surgery units to assess the impact on colorectal cancer surgery waiting lists. METHOD: All personnel in charge of colorectal surgery units nationwide received a survey (from February to April, 2020) with eight questions divided into three sections-cessation date of colorectal cancer surgeries, number of patients waiting for treatment, and use of neoadjuvant therapy to postpone surgery. RESULTS: Sixty-seven units participated in the study, with 79.1% of units ceasing some type of activity (32.8% total and 46.3% partial cessation) and 20.9% continuing all surgical activity. In addition, 65% of units used or prolonged neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer patients and 40% of units performed at least five emergency colorectal cancer surgeries. It was estimated that at least one month of intense surgical activity will be required to catch up. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, patients from units with a long waiting list must be redistributed, at least within the country. In the future, in the event of a second wave of the pandemic, an effective program to manage each unit's resources should be developed to prevent total collapse.	Prevention
34224205	SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) from Antwerp sewer system, Belgium. SARS-CoV-2 human-to-animal transmission can lead to the establishment of novel reservoirs and the evolution of new variants with the potential to start new outbreaks in humans. We tested Norway rats inhabiting the sewer system of Antwerp, Belgium, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 following a local COVID-19 epidemic peak. In addition, we discuss the use and interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests on non-human samples. Between November and December 2020, Norway rat oral swabs, faeces and tissues from the sewer system of Antwerp were collected to be tested by RT-qPCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples were screened for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using a Luminex microsphere immunoassay (MIA). Samples considered positive were then checked for neutralizing antibodies using a conventional viral neutralization test (cVNT). The serum of 35 rats was tested by MIA showing three potentially positive sera that were later negative by cVNT. All tissue samples of 39 rats analysed tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This is the first study that evaluates SARS-CoV-2 infection in urban rats. We can conclude that the sample of rats analysed had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, monitoring activities should continue due to the emergence of new variants prone to infect Muridae rodents.	Diagnosis;Transmission;Prevention
34213804	Renal Resistive Index: Not Only for Kidney Clinics. Renal Resistive Index (RRI) is a measurement of the resistance of the renal blood flow. A value higher than 0.70 is a marker of increased resistance and is correlated with kidney injury and its severity. Additionally, it may be associated with the mortality rate in the post-surgery population. In COVID-19 subjects, we found that high RRI has been associated with high levels of serum C-reactive protein, a marker of systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome. Finally, we propose RRI not only as a marker of kidney injury, but also as a tool to evaluate the course of critical illness.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34287894	Human Models for COVID-19 Research. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 presents a diverse clinical spectrum, ranging from an asymptomatic carrier state to patients with life-threatening multi-organ failure and death (Huang et al., 48a). The greatest risk factor for severe disease is age, with higher morbidity and mortality rates in the elderly population, despite younger people shedding similar levels of virus (Yanez et al., 104). The overall case fatality rate of COVID-19 is 2.3%, rising to 14.8% in patients over the age of 80, and 49% among the critically ill (Kang & Jung, 55). Currently, therapeutics for COVID-19 are limited. To overcome this, it is important that we use physiologically relevant models to reproduce the pathology of infection and evaluate the efficacy of antiviral drugs. Models of airway infection, including the use of a human infection challenge model or well-defined, disease relevant in vitro systems can help determine the key components that perpetuate the severity of the disease. Here, we briefly review the human models that are currently being used in COVID-19 research and drug development. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	Treatment
34377699	Loculated Empyema and SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Report of Two Cases and Review of the Literature. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical manifestations are diverse and can vary from mild respiratory symptoms to severe hypoxic respiratory failure. In severe cases, infection can cause gastrointestinal, renal, cardiac, neurological and haematological complications and result in multi-organ failure. There are very few reports of parapneumonic effusion in patients with COVID-19. We describe two patients with COVID-19 who had loculated empyema and discuss the clinical course and therapeutic options. LEARNING POINTS: The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vary from mild to severe disease and can result in multi-organ failure.Pleural empyema is usually treated with a combination of antibiotics and surgical drainage of the pleural cavity.

34221083	"Candidate Anti-COVID-19 Medicinal Plants from Ethiopia: A Review of Plants Traditionally Used to Treat Viral Diseases. Background: Emerging viral infections are among the major global public health concerns. The pandemic COVID-19 is a contagious respiratory and vascular disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There are no medicines that can treat SARS-CoV-2 except the vaccines. Therefore, searching for plant-originated therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 is required. Consequently, reviewing medicinal plants used to treat different viral infections is mandatory. This review article aims to review the ethnobotanical knowledge of medicinal plants traditionally used to treat different viral diseases by the Ethiopian people and suggests those plants as candidates to fight COVID-19. Methods: Articles written in English were searched from online public databases using searching terms like ""Traditional Medicine,"" ""Ethnobotanical study,"" ""Active components,"" ""Antiviral activities,"" and ""Ethiopia."" Ethnobotanical data were analyzed using the Excel statistical software program. Result: From the 46 articles reviewed, a total of 111 plant species were claimed to treat viral infections. Fifty-six (50.4%) of the plant species had reported to have antiviral active components that are promising to treat COVID-19. Lycorine, gingerol shogaol, resveratrol, rhoifolin, oleanolic acid, kaempferol, rosmarinic acid, almond oil, ursolic acid, hederagenin, nigellidine, alpha-hederin, apigenin, nobiletin, tangeretin, chalcone, hesperidin, epigallocatechin gallate, allicin, diallyl trisulfide, ajoene, aloenin, artemisinin, glucobrassicin, curcumin, piperine, flavonoids, anthraquinone, hydroxychloroquine, and jensenone were some of them. Conclusion: The Ethiopian traditional knowledge applies a lot of medicinal plants to treat different viral infections. Reports of the chemical components of many of them confirm that they can be promising to fight COVID-19."	Treatment

34203880	"Dexamethasone in the Treatment of COVID-19: Primus Inter Pares? Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread globally, becoming a huge public health challenge. Even though the vast majority of patients are asymptomatic, some patients present with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and death. It has been shown in several studies that the severity and clinical outcomes are related to dysregulated antiviral immunity and enhanced and persistent systemic inflammation. Corticosteroids have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, as they are reported to elicit benefits by reducing lung inflammation and inflammation-induced lung injury. Dexamethasone has gained a major role in the therapeutic algorithm of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen or on mechanical ventilation. Its wide anti-inflammatory action seems to form the basis for its beneficial action, taming the overwhelming ""cytokine storm"". Amid a plethora of scientific research on therapeutic options for COVID-19, there are still unanswered questions about the right timing, right dosing, and right duration of the corticosteroid treatment. The aim of this review article was to summarize the data on the dexamethasone treatment in COVID-19 and outline the clinical considerations of corticosteroid therapy in these patients."	Treatment
34228363	Clinical features and outcome of COVID-19 positive children from a tertiary healthcare hospital in Karachi. : As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to evolve, differences in epidemiological and clinical features among pediatrics have been noticed across different countries. We describe the spectrum of COVID-19 in pediatric patients treated in tertiary health care. We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients admitted to Indus Hospital & Health care network, Korangi campus, Karachi; from April 1st, 2020 to July 31st, 2020. A total of 141 COVID-19 cases were reported, males were 81 (57%) and the median age was 8 (0.3-17) years. Moderate and severe infections were noted in 36(26%), and 17(12%) children respectively. Fever (50%) was the most common clinical feature. The SF ratio less than 264 was significantly associated with severe disease (p < .05). Lab investigations that differed significantly across disease severity groups included IL-6 levels (p < .01) and Prothrombin time (p < .05). Majority of children were advised home isolation 89 (63%), 29 (20.5%) were admitted while mortality was observed in 10 (7%) children. No significant difference was observed between children with and without malignancy. Pre-existing comorbidities are significantly associated with COVID-19 infections among children. Reduced SF ratio, elevated Prothrombin time, and interleukin-6 levels are associated with greater disease severity.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34282132	Adversity in early life and pregnancy are immunologically distinct from total life adversity: macrophage-associated phenotypes in women exposed to interpersonal violence. Early childhood and pregnancy are two sensitive periods of heightened immune plasticity, when exposure to adversity may disproportionately increase health risks. However, we need deeper phenotyping to disentangle the impact of adversity during sensitive periods from that across the total lifespan. This study examined whether retrospective reports of adversity during childhood or pregnancy were associated with inflammatory imbalance, in an ethnically diverse cohort of 53 low-income women seeking family-based trauma treatment following exposure to interpersonal violence. Structured interviews assessed early life adversity (trauma exposure </= age 5), pregnancy adversity, and total lifetime adversity. Blood serum was assayed for pro-inflammatory (TNF-a, IL-1ss, IL-6, and CRP) and anti-inflammatory (IL-1RA, IL-4, and IL-10) cytokines. CD14+ monocytes were isolated in a subsample (n = 42) and gene expression assayed by RNA sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 4000; TruSeq cDNA library). The primary outcome was a macrophage-associated M1/M2 gene expression phenotype. To evaluate sensitivity and specificity, we contrasted M1/M2 gene expression with a second, clinically-validated macrophage-associated immunosuppressive phenotype (endotoxin tolerance) and with pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels. Adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, and psychopathology, higher adversity in early life (ss = .337, p = 0.029) and pregnancy (ss = .332, p = 0.032) were each associated with higher M1/M2 gene expression, whereas higher lifetime adversity (ss = -.341, p = 0.031) was associated with lower immunosuppressive gene expression. Adversity during sensitive periods was uniquely associated with M1/M2 imbalance, among low-income women with interpersonal violence exposure. Given that M1/M2 imbalance is found in sepsis, severe COVID-19 and myriad chronic diseases, these findings implicate novel immune mechanisms underlying the impact of adversity on health.	Mechanism
34132436	Identification of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 inhibitors through in silico structure-based virtual screening and molecular interaction studies. The novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 has caused a worldwide pandemic. The fatal virus has affected the health of human beings as well as the socio-economic situation all over the world. To date, no concrete medicinal solution has been proposed to combat the viral infection, calling for an urgent, strategic, and cost-effective drug development approach that may be achievable by applying targeted computational and virtual screening protocols. Immunity is the body's natural defense against disease-causing pathogens, which can be boosted by consuming plant-based or natural food products. Active constituents derived from natural sources also scavenge the free radicals and have anti-inflammatory activities. Herbs and spices have been used for various medicinal purposes. In this study, 2,96 365 natural and synthetic derivatives (ligands) belonging to 102 classes of compounds were obtained from PubChem and assessed on Lipinski's parameters for their potential bioavailability. Out of all the derivatives, 3254 obeyed Lipinski's rule and were virtually screened. The 115 top derivatives were docked against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-HKV1 main proteases (M(pro) s) as receptors using AutoDock Vina, AutoDock, and iGEMDOCK 2.1. The lowest binding energy was exhibited by ligands 2 and 6 against all the four M(pro) s. The molecular dynamic simulation was also performed with ligand 6 using the GROMACS package. Good bioactivity scores, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profile and drug-like pharmacokinetic parameters were also obtained. Hydroxychloroquine was used as the control drug.	Mechanism;Treatment
34293263	A framework to support the integration of priority setting in the preparedness, alert, control and evaluation stages of a disease pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic, where the need-resource gap has necessitated decision makers in some contexts to ration access to life-saving interventions, has demonstrated the critical need for systematic and fair priority setting and resource allocation mechanisms. Disease outbreaks are becoming increasingly common and priority setting lessons from previous disease outbreaks could be better harnessed to inform decision making and planning for future disease outbreaks. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how priority setting and resource allocation could, ideally, be integrated into the WHO pandemic planning and preparedness framework and used to inform the COVID-19 pandemic recovery plans and plans for future outbreaks. Priority setting and resource allocation during disease outbreaks tend to evoke a process similar to the 'rule of rescue'. This results in inefficient and unfair resource allocation, negative effects on health and non-health programs and increased health inequities. Integrating priority setting and resource allocation activities throughout the four phases of the WHO emergency preparedness framework could ensure that priority setting during health emergencies is systematic, evidence informed and fair.

34225390	Triangle of cytokine storm, central nervous system involvement, and viral infection in COVID-19: the role of sFasL and neuropilin-1. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is often linked to extreme inflammatory responses by over activation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), cytokine storm, and sepsis. These are robust causes for multi-organ damage. In particular, potential routes of SARS-CoV2 entry, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), have been linked to central nervous system (CNS) involvement. CNS has been recognized as one of the most susceptible compartments to cytokine storm, which can be affected by neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). ACE2 is widely-recognized as a SARS-CoV2 entry pathway; However, NRP-1 has been recently introduced as a novel path of viral entry. Apoptosis of cells invaded by this virus involves Fas receptor-Fas ligand (FasL) signaling; moreover, Fas receptor may function as a controller of inflammation. Furthermore, NRP-1 may influence FasL and modulate cytokine profile. The neuroimmunological insult by SARS-CoV2 infection may be inhibited by therapeutic approaches targeting soluble Fas ligand (sFasL), cytokine storm elements, or related viral entry pathways. In the current review, we explain pivotal players behind the activation of cytokine storm that are associated with vast CNS injury. We also hypothesize that sFasL may affect neuroinflammatory processes and trigger the cytokine storm in COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34289134	Lassa fever amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa: A rising concern, efforts, challenges, and future recommendations. Lassa fever, caused by the Lassa virus of the Arenaviruses family, is a re-emerging public health concern that has led to 300,000 infections and 5000 deaths annually in Africa. Highly prevalent in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria, Cote d'lvoire, Ghana, Togo, and Benin, patients infected with the virus can manifest with cough, sore throat, headache, nausea, and vomiting among other symptoms. Coexisting with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its impacts, cases of Lassa fever in the African population have been reported to decrease due to hesitancy in visiting clinics that leads to unreported cases-all contributing to a silent outbreak in West Africa. Thus, to overcome current burdens, gaps, and challenges caused by Lassa fever amidst COVID-19 in Africa, various recommendations for efficient control of transmission, measures for disease containment, and strategies to correct misperceptions were made.

34213786	"COVID-19 skin lesions are rarely positive at RT-PCR test: the macrophage activation with vascular impact and SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. BACKGROUND: Several skin manifestations have been reported since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic: chilblains-like, livedoid lesions, urticaria-like, pseudo-Kawasaki disease, and others. Histopathologic images of these lesions most often show aspects of endothelitis, images similar to autoimmune vasculitis. Cutaneous lesions are often negative at RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 virus. METHOD AND RESULTS: We reviewed recent articles on the mechanisms of COVID-19 and we synthesized main pathways of inflammatory cascade. After the penetration into the cells of the respiratory epithelium, SARS-CoV-2 virus initiates a ""cytokine storm"" well described in previous publications: the expression of interferon type I (IFN-I) is one of the key elements of the antiviral response in COVID-19 patients, IFN-I expression seems to play an important role in the induction of interleukin 6 (IL-6), chemotactic factors such as Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) and the consequent activation of monocyte-macrophage system followed by the expression of TNF-alpha, and finally by the induction of coagulation factors by both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The simplified synthesis of the main pathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19 could help us to understand at least partially the importance of macrophage activation and its vascular involvement in many skin lesions that remain often negative at in situ tests for SARS-CoV-2."

34222786	Complete heart block associated with Remdesivir in COVID-19: a case report. Background: Since the pandemic began in 2020, Remdesivir has been widely used for the treatment of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Here, we describe a case of a patient with COVID-19 who developed transient complete atrioventricular (AV) block and bradycardia after initiating treatment with Remdesivir. Case summary: A 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and lung cancer was hospitalized for COVID-19. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission demonstrated atrial fibrillation and right bundle branch block. He was started on a course of Dexamethasone and Remdesivir. Within 24 h of starting Remdesivir, he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates between 30 and 40 b.p.m. On Day 5 of Remdesivir therapy, ECG demonstrated complete AV block. Having completed the Remdesivir regimen, during the next 48 h, he was closely monitored, and the AV block resolved spontaneously. As he remained asymptomatic and had an adequate chronotropic response with activity, pacemaker implantation was not recommended. Discussion: Despite the widespread use of Remdesivir, there is little known information about its cardiac toxicity. Daily ECGs and close cardiac surveillance of patients who develop severe bradycardia or AV block are essential. Discontinuation of the medication usually results in the resolution of these cardiac disturbances.	Case Report
34201817	Comparative Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Salix Cortex Extracts and Acetylsalicylic Acid in SARS-CoV-2 Peptide and LPS-Activated Human In Vitro Systems. The usefulness of anti-inflammatory drugs as an adjunct therapy to improve outcomes in COVID-19 patients is intensely discussed in this paper. Willow bark (Salix cortex) has been used for centuries to relieve pain, inflammation, and fever. Its main active ingredient, salicin, is metabolized in the human body into salicylic acid, the precursor of the commonly used pain drug acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Here, we report on the in vitro anti-inflammatory efficacy of two methanolic Salix extracts, standardized to phenolic compounds, in comparison to ASA in the context of a SARS-CoV-2 peptide challenge. Using SARS-CoV-2 peptide/IL-1beta- or LPS-activated human PBMCs and an inflammatory intestinal Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-culture, Salix extracts, and ASA concentration-dependently suppressed prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a principal mediator of inflammation. The inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity, but not protein expression was observed for ASA and one Salix extract. In activated PBMCs, the suppression of relevant cytokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-1beta, and IL-10) was seen for both Salix extracts. The anti-inflammatory capacity of Salix extracts was still retained after transepithelial passage and liver cell metabolism in an advanced co-culture model system consisting of intestinal Caco-2/HT29-MTX cells and differentiated hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells. Taken together, our in vitro data suggest that Salix extracts might present an additional anti-inflammatory treatment option in the context of SARS-CoV-2 peptides challenge; however, more confirmatory data are needed.

34228746	Comorbidities, sequelae, blood biomarkers and their associated clinical outcomes in the Mount Sinai Health System COVID-19 patients. With the continuing rise of SARS-CoV2 infection globally and the emergence of various waves in different countries, understanding characteristics of susceptibility to infection, clinical severity, and outcomes remain vital. In this retrospective study, data was extracted for 39,539 patients from the de-identified Mount Sinai Health System COVID-19 database. We assessed the risk of mortality based on the presence of comorbidities and organ-specific sequelae in 7,032 CoV2 positive (+) patients. Prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities was high among SARS-CoV2+ individuals. Diabetes, obesity, coronary artery disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure all increased overall mortality risk, while asthma did not. Ethnicity modified the risk of mortality associated with these comorbidities. With regards to secondary complications in the setting of infection, individuals with acute kidney injury and acute myocardial injury showed an increase in mortality risk. Cerebral infarcts and acute venous thromboembolic events were not associated with increased risk of mortality. Biomarkers for cardiovascular injury, coagulation, and inflammation were compared between deceased and survived individuals. We found that cardiac and coagulation biomarkers were elevated and fell beyond normal range more often in deceased patients. Several, but not all, inflammatory markers evaluated were increased in deceased patients. In summary, we identified comorbidities and sequelae along with peripheral blood biomarkers that were associated with elevated clinical severity and poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Overall, these findings detail the granularity of previously reported factors which may impact susceptibility, clinical severity, and mortality during the course of COVID-19 disease.

34208906	The Evolution of the Use of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Respiratory Failure. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used with increasing frequency to support patients with acute respiratory failure, most commonly, and severe forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The marked increase in the global use of ECMO followed the publication of a large randomized trial in 2009 and the experience garnered during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, and has been further supported by the release of a large, randomized clinical trial in 2018, confirming a benefit from using ECMO in patients with severe ARDS. Despite a rapid expansion of ECMO-related publications, optimal management of patients receiving ECMO, in terms of patient selection, ventilator management, anticoagulation, and transfusion strategies, is evolving. Most recently, ECMO is being utilized for an expanding variety of conditions, including for cases of severe pulmonary or cardiac failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review evaluates modern evidence for ECMO for respiratory failure and the current challenges in the field.	Treatment
34202563	Thoracic Surgery in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Novel Approach to Reach Guideline Consensus. The COVID-19 pandemic challenges international and national healthcare systems. In the field of thoracic surgery, procedures may be deferred due to mandatory constraints of the access to diagnostics, staff and follow-up facilities. There is a lack of prospective data on the management of benign and malignant thoracic conditions in the pandemic. Therefore, we derived recommendations from 14 thoracic societies to address key questions on the topic of COVID-19 in the field of thoracic surgery. Respective recommendations were extracted and the degree of consensus among different organizations was calculated. A high degree of consensus was found to temporarily suspend non-critical elective procedures or procedures for benign conditions and to prioritize patients with symptomatic or advanced cancer. Prior to hospitalization, patients should be screened for respiratory symptoms indicating possible COVID-19 infection and most societies recommended to screen all patients for COVID-19 prior to admission. There was a weak consensus on the usage of serology tests and CT scans for COVID-19 diagnostics. Nearly all societies suggested to postpone elective procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and recommended constant reevaluation of these patients. Additionally, we summarized recommendations focusing on precautions in the theater and the management of chest drains. This study provides a novel approach to informed guidance for thoracic surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of scientific evidence-based data.	Prevention
34347784	Deep geometric representations for modeling effects of mutations on protein-protein binding affinity. Modeling the impact of amino acid mutations on protein-protein interaction plays a crucial role in protein engineering and drug design. In this study, we develop GeoPPI, a novel structure-based deep-learning framework to predict the change of binding affinity upon mutations. Based on the three-dimensional structure of a protein, GeoPPI first learns a geometric representation that encodes topology features of the protein structure via a self-supervised learning scheme. These representations are then used as features for training gradient-boosting trees to predict the changes of protein-protein binding affinity upon mutations. We find that GeoPPI is able to learn meaningful features that characterize interactions between atoms in protein structures. In addition, through extensive experiments, we show that GeoPPI achieves new state-of-the-art performance in predicting the binding affinity changes upon both single- and multi-point mutations on six benchmark datasets. Moreover, we show that GeoPPI can accurately estimate the difference of binding affinities between a few recently identified SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. These results demonstrate the potential of GeoPPI as a powerful and useful computational tool in protein design and engineering. Our code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/Liuxg16/GeoPPI.	Mechanism;Treatment
34281608	SARS-CoV-2: from its discovery to genome structure, transcription, and replication. SARS-CoV-2 is an extremely contagious respiratory virus causing adult atypical pneumonia COVID-19 with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA (+RNA) genome of ~ 29.9 kb and exhibits significant genetic shift from different isolates. After entering the susceptible cells expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the SARS-CoV-2 genome directly functions as an mRNA to translate two polyproteins from the ORF1a and ORF1b region, which are cleaved by two viral proteases into sixteen non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) to initiate viral genome replication and transcription. The SARS-CoV-2 genome also encodes four structural (S, E, M and N) and up to six accessory (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and 9b) proteins, but their translation requires newly synthesized individual subgenomic RNAs (sgRNA) in the infected cells. Synthesis of the full-length viral genomic RNA (gRNA) and sgRNAs are conducted inside double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) by the viral replication and transcription complex (RTC), which comprises nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and a short RNA primer. To produce sgRNAs, RTC starts RNA synthesis from the highly structured gRNA 3' end and switches template at various transcription regulatory sequence (TRSB) sites along the gRNA body probably mediated by a long-distance RNA-RNA interaction. The TRS motif in the gRNA 5' leader (TRSL) is responsible for the RNA-RNA interaction with the TRSB upstream of each ORF and skipping of the viral genome in between them to produce individual sgRNAs. Abundance of individual sgRNAs and viral gRNA synthesized in the infected cells depend on the location and read-through efficiency of each TRSB. Although more studies are needed, the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has taught the world a painful lesson that is to invest and proactively prepare future emergence of other types of coronaviruses and any other possible biological horrors.

34202731	"Evaluation of Two Rapid Antigenic Tests for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasopharyngeal Swabs. (1) Background: In the current context of the COVID-19 crisis, there is a need for fast, easy-to-use, and sensitive diagnostic tools in addition to molecular methods. We have therefore decided to evaluate the performance of newly available antigen detection kits in ""real-life"" laboratory conditions. (2) Methods: The sensitivity and specificity of two rapid diagnostic tests (RDT)-the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip from Coris Bioconcept, Belgium (CoRDT), and the coronavirus antigen rapid test cassette from Healgen Scientific, LLC, USA (HeRDT)-were evaluated on 193 nasopharyngeal samples using RT-PCR as the gold standard. (3) Results: The sensitivity obtained for HeRDT was 88% for all collected samples and 91.1% for samples with Ct </= 31. For the CoRDT test, the sensitivity obtained was 62% for all collected samples and 68.9% for samples with Ct </= 31. (4) Conclusions: Despite the excellent specificity obtained for both kits, the poor sensitivity of the CoRDT did not allow for its use in the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. HeRDT satisfied the World Health Organization's performance criteria for rapid antigen detection tests. Its high sensitivity, quick response, and ease of use allowed for the implementation of HeRDT at the laboratory of the University Hospital of Liege."	Diagnosis
34292858	Exploring Behavioral Typologies to Inform COVID-19 Health Campaigns: A Person-Centered Approach. As the United States continues to be ravaged by COVID-19, it becomes increasingly important to implement effective public health campaigns to improve personal behaviors that help control the spread of the virus. To design effective campaigns, research is needed to understand the current mitigation intentions of the general public, diversity in those intentions, and theoretical predictors of them. COVID-19 campaigns will be particularly challenging because mitigation involves myriad, diverse behaviors. This study takes a person-centered approach to investigate data from a survey (N = 976) of Pennsylvania adults. Latent class analysis revealed five classes of mitigation: one marked by complete adherence with health recommendations (34% of the sample), one by complete refusal (9% of the sample), and three by a mixture of adherence and refusal. Statistically significant covariates of class membership included relatively positive injunctive norms, risk due to essential workers in the household, personal knowledge of someone who became infected with COVID-19, and belief that COVID-19 was a leaked biological weapon. Additionally, trait reactance was associated with non-adherence while health mavenism was associated with adherence. These findings may be used to good effect by local healthcare providers and institutions, and also inform broader policy-making decisions regarding public health campaigns to mitigate COVID-19.

34131877	Is Curfew Effective in Limiting SARS-CoV-2 Progression? An Evaluation in France Based on Epidemiokinetic Analyses. BACKGROUND: Since late summer 2020, the French authorities implemented a curfew/lightened lockdown-alternating strategy instead of strict lockdown, to improve acceptability and limit socioeconomic consequences. However, data on curfew-related efficacy to control the epidemic are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects on COVID-19 spread in France of curfew combined to local and/or nationwide restrictions from late summer 2020 to mid-February 2021. DESIGN: We conducted a comparative evaluation using a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-based model completed with epidemiokinetic tools. MAIN MEASURES: We analyzed the time-course of epidemic progression rate under curfew in French Guyana and five metropolitan regions where additional restrictions were implemented at different times. Using linear regressions of the decay/increase rates in daily contaminations, we calculated the epidemic regression half-lives (t1/2beta) for each identified period. KEY RESULTS: In French Guyana, two decay periods with rapid regression (t1/2beta of ~10 days) were observed under curfew, with slowing (t1/2beta of ~43 days) when curfew was lightened. During the 2-week pre-lockdown curfew (2020/10/17-2020/11/02) in Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur, Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes, and Ile-de-France, the epidemic progression was unchanged. During the post-lockdown curfew (2020/12/15-2020/02/14), the epidemic slowly regressed in Grand-Est (t1/2beta of ~37 days), whereas its progression rate plateaued in Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes and increased immediately in Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur, Ile-de-France, and Nouvelle-Aquitaine, whatever the curfew starting time was (06:00 or 08:00 pm). Interestingly, a delayed slow decay (17 days < t1/2beta < 64 days) occurred under curfew in all regions except Ile-de-France. CONCLUSIONS: Curfew allowed the temporary control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, however variably in the French regions, without preventing lockdown necessity. To accelerate the epidemic regression such as observed in French Guyana, curfew should be implemented timely with additional restrictions.	Prevention
34221850	Omphalopagus conjoined twins separation during coronavirus disease-19 pandemic era: A case report. Introduction and importance: Conjoined twin is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by a fusion of certain anatomical structures. Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is a new emerging infectious respiratory disease affecting worldwide and potentially leads to acute respiratory distress (ARDS) in children. COVID-19 has reconstructed the healthcare system, including surgical care and decision-making. Case presentation: Herein we describe a surgical separation of 2.5 months old omphalopagus conjoined twins, with one of them (Baby A) presenting COVID-19-associated respiratory distress, as well as the challenges faced during the preparation and the execution of the complex surgical procedure. Clinical discussion: Baby A underwent antiviral therapy, oxygen supplementation, and ventilation in the ICU, while baby B remained stable and confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2. The separation surgery was conducted after baby A had become clinically stable. Defect closure and reconstruction were accomplished. At one week follow-up, Baby A died of lung infection, while baby B remained well after one year. Conclusion: The complexity of surgical separation requires careful planning by a multidisciplinary team. Surgical separation of conjoined twins during the pandemic era has not been reported much in the literature, more reports are required to provide further insight.	Case Report
34209085	Long-Term Outcomes of Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 at One Year after Hospital Discharge. BACKGROUND: The long-term effects of COVID-19 remain largely unclear. This study aims to investigate post-acute health consequences and mortality one year after hospital discharge. METHODS: All surviving adult patients who were discharged after hospital admission due to acute COVID-19 in the first wave of the pandemic underwent a comprehensive interview. Functional assessment was performed in patients aged over 65. Clinical and hospital records were reviewed and mortality causes assessed. RESULTS: A total of 587 patients with COVID-19 were discharged from hospital, including 266 after hospital admission and 321 from the emergency room. Mortality within the following year occurred in 34/266 (12.8%) and 10/321 (3.1%), respectively, due to causes directly or possibly related to COVID-19 in 20.5% and 25% of patients. Post-COVID-19 syndrome was assessed in 543 patients at one year from discharge. Any clinical complaint was reported by 90.1% of patients who needed hospitalization and 80.4% of those discharged from the emergency room (p = 0.002), with breathlessness (41.6%), tiredness (35.4%), ageusia (30.2%), and anosmia (26.3%) being the most common complaints. Ongoing symptoms attributed to COVID-19 were reported by 66.8% and 49.5% of patients, respectively (p < 0.001). Newly developed COPD, asthma, diabetes, heart failure, and arthritis-as well as worsening of preexisting comorbidities-were found. CONCLUSIONS: One-year mortality among survivors of acute COVID-19 was 7.5%. A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients experienced ongoing symptoms at 1 year from onset of the disease.

34287935	Adding saliva testing to oropharyngeal and deep nasal swab testing increases PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in primary care and children. OBJECTIVE: To compare the concordance and acceptability of saliva testing with standard-of-care oropharyngeal and bilateral deep nasal swab testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children and in general practice. DESIGN: Prospective multicentre diagnostic validation study. SETTING: Royal Children's Hospital, and two general practices (cohealth, West Melbourne; Cirqit Health, Altona North) in Melbourne, July-October 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 1050 people who provided paired saliva and oropharyngeal-nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of cases in which SARS-CoV-2 was detected in either specimen type by real-time polymerase chain reaction; concordance of results for paired specimens; positive percent agreement (PPA) for virus detection, by specimen type. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 54 of 1050 people with assessable specimens (5%), including 19 cases (35%) in which both specimens were positive. The overall PPA was 72% (95% CI, 58-84%) for saliva and 63% (95% CI, 49-76%) for oropharyngeal-nasal swabs. For the 35 positive specimens from people aged 10 years or more, PPA was 86% (95% CI, 70-95%) for saliva and 63% (95% CI, 45-79%) for oropharyngeal-nasal swabs. Adding saliva testing to standard-of-care oropharyngeal-nasal swab testing increased overall case detection by 59% (95% CI, 29-95%). Providing saliva was preferred to an oropharyngeal-nasal swab by most participants (75%), including 141 of 153 children under 10 years of age (92%). CONCLUSION: In children over 10 years of age and adults, saliva testing alone may be suitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection, while for children under 10, saliva testing may be suitable as an adjunct to oropharyngeal-nasal swab testing for increasing case detection.

34213997	The Deaf Community's Experiences Navigating COVID-19 Pandemic Information. BACKGROUND: Users of American Sign Language (ASL) who are deaf often face barriers receiving health information, contributing to significant gaps in health knowledge and health literacy. To reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its risk to the public, the government and health care providers have encouraged social distancing, use of face masks, hand hygiene, and quarantines. Unfortunately, COVID-19 information has rarely been available in ASL, which puts the deaf community at a disadvantage for accessing reliable COVID-19 information. OBJECTIVE: This study's primary objective was to compare COVID-19-related information access between participants who are deaf and participants who are hearing. METHODS: The study included 104 adults who are deaf and 74 adults who are hearing who had participated in a prior health literacy study. Surveys were conducted between April and July 2020 via video conference, smartphone apps, or phone calls. COVID-19 data were linked with preexisting data on demographic and health literacy data as measured by the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) and the ASL-NVS. KEY RESULTS: Neither group of participants differed in their ability to identify COVID-19 symptoms. Adults who are deaf were 4.7 times more likely to report difficulty accessing COVID-19 information (p = .011), yet reported using more preventive strategies overall. Simultaneously, adults who are deaf had 60% lower odds of staying home and calling their doctor versus seeking health care immediately or doing something else compared with participants who are hearing if they suspected that they had COVID-19 (p = .020). CONCLUSIONS: Additional education on recommended COVID-19 management and guidance on accessible health care navigation strategies are needed for the deaf community and health care providers. Public health officials should ensure that public service announcements are accessible to all audiences and should connect with trusted agents within the deaf community to help disseminate health information online in ASL through their social media channels. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice. 2021;5(2):e162-e170.] Plain Language Summary: Compared to participants who are hearing, a higher portion of participants who are deaf reported challenges with accessing, understanding, and trusting COVID-19 information. Although respondents who are deaf had similar knowledge of symptoms compared to participants who are hearing, they used more prevention strategies and were more likely to plan immediate care for suspected symptoms. Improved guidance on COVID-19 management and health care navigation accessible to the deaf community is needed.	Prevention
34348963	Complications of nasal SARS-CoV-2 testing: a review. Transnasal swab testing for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is well established. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advocates swabbing either of the anterior nares, middle turbinate, or nasopharynx for specimen collection depending on available local resources. The purpose of this review is to investigate complications related to transnasal SARS-CoV-2 testing with specific attention to specimen collection site and swab approach. The literature demonstrates that while nasopharyngeal swabbing is associated with an increased risk of complications, it should remain the gold-standard test due to greater diagnostic accuracy relative to anterior nasal and middle turbinate swabs.

34202243	Air Pollution and COVID-19: A Possible Dangerous Synergy for Male Fertility. Several studies indicate that semen quality has strongly declined in the last decades worldwide. Air pollution represents a significant co-factor with the COVID-19 impact and has negative effects on the male reproductive system, through pro-oxidant, inflammatory and immune-dysregulating mechanisms. It has recently been reported that chronic exposure to PM2.5 causes overexpression of the alveolar ACE2 receptor, the entry route of SARS-CoV-2 into the organism shared by the lungs and testis where expression is highest in the body. In the testis, the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR pathway plays an important role in the regulation of spermatogenesis and an indirect mechanism of testicular damage could be due to the blockade of the ACE2 receptor by SARS-CoV-2. This prevents the conversion of specific angiotensins, and their excess causes inflammation with the overproduction of cytokines. PM2.5-induced overexpression of the alveolar ACE2 receptor, in turn, could increase local viral load in patients exposed to pollutants, producing ACE2 receptor depletion and compromising host defenses. By presenting an overall view of epidemiological data and molecular mechanisms, this manuscript aims to interpret the possible synergistic effects of both air pollution and COVID-19 on male reproductive function, warning that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the fertile years may represent a significant threat to global reproductive health. All of this should be of great concern, especially for men of the age of maximum reproductive capacity, and an important topic of debate for policy makers. Altered environmental conditions, together with the direct and indirect short- and long-term effects of viral infection could cause a worsening of semen quality with important consequences for male fertility, especially in those areas with higher environmental impact.

COVID-19 is a complex disease with many clinicopathological issues, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, renal, cutaneous, and coagulative ones; in addition, reactive arthritis has been reported by different authors. Here, we hypothesize that a peripheral microangiopathy involving nerve supply, a viral demyelination, or an immune-mediated irritating antigenic stimulus on synovial sheaths after SARS-CoV-2 infection may all induce a carpal, cubital or tarsal tunnel syndrome of variable entity in genetically predisposed subjects associated with myxoid nerve degeneration.

34281575	Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on severe trauma trends and healthcare system reassessment in Lombardia, Italy: an analysis from the regional trauma registry. BACKGROUNDS: The COVID-19 pandemic drastically strained the health systems worldwide, obligating the reassessment of how healthcare is delivered. In Lombardia, Italy, a Regional Emergency Committee (REC) was established and the regional health system reorganized, with only three hospitals designated as hubs for trauma care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of this reorganization of regional care, comparing the distribution of patients before and during the COVID-19 outbreak and to describe changes in the epidemiology of severe trauma among the two periods. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted using retrospectively collected data from the Regional Trauma Registry of Lombardia (LTR). We compared the data of trauma patients admitted to three hub hospitals before the COVID-19 outbreak (September 1 to November 19, 2019) with those recorded during the pandemic (February 21 to May 10, 2020) in the same hospitals. Demographic data, level of pre-hospital care (Advanced Life Support-ALS, Basic Life Support-BLS), type of transportation, mechanism of injury (MOI), abbreviated injury score (AIS, 1998 version), injury severity score (ISS), revised trauma score (RTS), and ICU admission and survival outcome of all the patients admitted to the three trauma centers designed as hubs, were reviewed. Screening for COVID-19 was performed with nasopharyngeal swabs, chest ultrasound, and/or computed tomography. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, trauma patients admitted to the hubs increased (46.4% vs 28.3%, p < 0.001) with an increase in pre-hospital time (71.8 vs 61.3 min, p < 0.01), while observed in hospital mortality was unaffected. TRISS, ISS, AIS, and ICU admission were similar in both periods. During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed substantial changes in MOI of severe trauma patients admitted to three hubs, with increases of unintentional (31.9% vs 18.5%, p < 0.05) and intentional falls (8.4% vs 1.2%, p < 0.05), whereas the pandemic restrictions reduced road- related injuries (35.6% vs 60%, p < 0.05). Deaths on scene were significantly increased (17.7% vs 6.8%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak affected the epidemiology of severe trauma patients. An increase in trauma patient admissions to a few designated facilities with high level of care obtained satisfactory results, while COVID-19 patients overwhelmed resources of most other hospitals.

34207918	Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and Early Variation of NLR to Predict In-Hospital Mortality and Severity in ED Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection. (1) Introduction: The neutrophil-to lymphocyte ratio is valued as a predictive marker in several inflammatory diseases. For example, an increasing NLR is a risk factor of mortality in sepsis. It also appears to be helpful in other settings such as cancer. The aim of our work was to study the prognostic value of NLR for disease severity and mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 upon their admission to the Emergency Department (ED) and its early variation (DeltaNLR) in the first 24 h of management (H-24). (2) Methods: Between 1 March and 30 April 2020, we conducted a multicenter and retrospective cohort study of patients with moderate or severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), who were all hospitalized after presenting to the ED. (3) Results: A total of 1035 patients were included in our study. Factors associated with infection severity were C-reactive protein level (OR: 1.007, CI 95%: [1.005-1.010], p < 0.001), NLR at H-24 (OR: 1.117, CI 95%: [1.060-1.176], p < 0.001), and DeltaNLR (OR: 1.877, CI 95%: [1.160-3.036], p: 0.01). The best threshold of DeltaNLR to predict the severity of infection was 0.222 (sensitivity 56.1%, specificity 68.3%). In multivariate analysis, the only biochemical factor significantly associated with mortality was again DeltaNLR (OR: 2.142, CI 95%: ([1.132-4.056], p: 0.019). The best threshold of DeltaNLR to predict mortality was 0.411 (sensitivity 53.3%; specificity 67.3%). (4) Conclusion: The NLR and its early variation (DeltaNLR) could help physicians predict both severity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hence contributing to optimized patient management (accurate triage and treatment).

34212286	Macrolactin A as a Novel Inhibitory Agent for SARS-CoV-2 M(pro): Bioinformatics Approach. COVID-19 is a disease that puts most of the world on lockdown and the search for therapeutic drugs is still ongoing. Therefore, this study used in silico screening to identify natural bioactive compounds from fruits, herbaceous plants, and marine invertebrates that are able to inhibit protease activity in SARS-CoV-2 (PDB: 6LU7). We have used extensive screening strategies such as drug likeliness, antiviral activity value prediction, molecular docking, ADME, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and MM/GBSA. A total of 17 compounds were shortlisted using Lipinski's rule in which 5 compounds showed significant predicted antiviral activity values. Among these 5, only 2 compounds, Macrolactin A and Stachyflin, showed good binding energy of -9.22 and -8.00 kcal/mol, respectively, within the binding pocket of the M(pro) catalytic residues (HIS 41 and CYS 145). These two compounds were further analyzed to determine their ADME properties. The ADME evaluation of these 2 compounds suggested that they could be effective in developing therapeutic drugs to be used in clinical trials. MD simulations showed that protein-ligand complexes of Macrolactin A and Stachyflin with the target receptor (6LU7) were stable for 100 nanoseconds. The MM/GBSA calculations of M(pro)-Macrolactin A complex indicated higher binding free energy (-42.58 +/- 6.35 kcal/mol). Dynamic cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) and principal component analysis (PCA) on the residual movement in the MD trajectories further confirmed the stability of Macrolactin A bound state with 6LU7. In conclusion, this study showed that marine natural compound Macrolactin A could be an effective therapeutic inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 protease (6LU7). Additional in vitro and in vivo validations are strongly needed to determine the efficacy and therapeutic dose of Macrolactin A in biological systems.	Mechanism;Treatment
34228642	Asymptomatic or mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits durable neutralizing antibody responses in children and adolescents. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, questions have emerged regarding the strength and durability of immune responses in specific populations. In this study, we evaluated humoral immune responses in 69 children and adolescents with asymptomatic or mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. We detected robust IgM, IgG, and IgA antibody responses to a broad array of SARS-CoV-2 antigens at the time of acute infection and 2 and 4 months after acute infection in all participants. Notably, these antibody responses were associated with virus neutralizing activity that was still detectable 4 months after acute infection in 94% of children. Moreover, antibody responses and neutralizing activity in sera from children and adolescents were comparable or superior to those observed in sera from 24 adults with mild symptomatic infection. Taken together, these findings indicate children and adolescents with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection generate robust and durable humoral immune responses likely contribute to protection from reinfection.

34222133	Acute myocarditis associated with anti-COVID-19 vaccination. Novel anti-coronavirus disease 2019 mRNA vaccines are rapidly implemented worldwide. Therefore, attention should be given to potentially life-threatening adverse reactions. We report on three young male patients, who developed acute myocarditis 2 days after receiving the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Primary acute myocarditis was not previously reported in association with vaccines that do not include adjuvants. A high index of suspicion should be maintained in order to diagnose and treat patients who develop auto-inflammatory vaccine-related complications in a timely manner. Further research is required in order to explore the significance of this phenomenon and its underlying molecular mechanism.	Case Report
34224752	Isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification-lateral flow detection of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The rapid detection of novel pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 necessitates the development of easy-to-use diagnostic tests that can be readily adapted and utilized in both clinical laboratories and field settings. Delay in diagnosis has facilitated the rapid spread of this novel virus throughout the world resulting in global mortality that will surpass 2.5 million people. Development of point-of-care diagnostic assays that can be performed in rural or decentralized health care centers to expand testing capacity is needed. We developed a qualitative test based on recombinase-polymerase-amplification coupled with lateral flow reading (RPA-LF) for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. The RPA-LF detected SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 35.4 viral cDNA nucleocapsid (N) gene copies/muL. Additionally, the RPA-LF was able to detect 0.25-2.5 copies/muL of SARS-CoV-2 N gene containing plasmid. We evaluated 37 nasopharyngeal samples using CDC's N3, N1 and N2 RT-real-time PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 as reference test. We found a 100 % concordance between RPA-LF and RT-qPCR reference test as determined by 18/18 positive and 19/19 negative samples. All positive samples had Ct values between 19-37 by RT-qPCR. The RPA-LF primers and probe did not cross react with other relevant betacoronaviruses such as SARS and MERS. This is the first isothermal amplification test paired with lateral flow developed for qualitative detection of COVID-19 allowing rapid viral detection and with prospective applicability in resource limited and decentralized laboratories.

34204911	Machine Learning to Predict In-Hospital Mortality in COVID-19 Patients Using Computed Tomography-Derived Pulmonary and Vascular Features. Pulmonary parenchymal and vascular damage are frequently reported in COVID-19 patients and can be assessed with unenhanced chest computed tomography (CT), widely used as a triaging exam. Integrating clinical data, chest CT features, and CT-derived vascular metrics, we aimed to build a predictive model of in-hospital mortality using univariate analysis (Mann-Whitney U test) and machine learning models (support vectors machines (SVM) and multilayer perceptrons (MLP)). Patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and unenhanced chest CT performed on emergency department admission were included after retrieving their outcome (discharge or death), with an 85/15% training/test dataset split. Out of 897 patients, the 229 (26%) patients who died during hospitalization had higher median pulmonary artery diameter (29.0 mm) than patients who survived (27.0 mm, p < 0.001) and higher median ascending aortic diameter (36.6 mm versus 34.0 mm, p < 0.001). SVM and MLP best models considered the same ten input features, yielding a 0.747 (precision 0.522, recall 0.800) and 0.844 (precision 0.680, recall 0.567) area under the curve, respectively. In this model integrating clinical and radiological data, pulmonary artery diameter was the third most important predictor after age and parenchymal involvement extent, contributing to reliable in-hospital mortality prediction, highlighting the value of vascular metrics in improving patient stratification.

34349582	Assessment of Ventilation and Perfusion in Patients with COVID-19 Discloses Unique Information of Pulmonary Function to a Clinician: Case Reports of V/P SPECT. V/P SPECT from 4 consecutive patients with COVID-19 suggests that ventilation and perfusion images may be applied to diagnose or exclude pulmonary embolism, verify nonsegmental diversion of perfusion from the ventilated areas (dead space ventilation) that may represent inflammation of the pulmonary vasculature, detect the reversed mismatch of poor ventilation and better preserved perfusion (shunt perfusion) in bilateral pulmonary inflammation and indicate redistribution of lung perfusion (antigravitational hyperperfusion) due to cardiac congestion. V/P mismatch and reversed mismatch may be extensive enough to diminish dramatically preserved matching ventilation/perfusion and to induce severe hypoxemia in COVID-19.	Case Report
34333122	SARS-CoV-2 in transit: characterization of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuelan migrants in Colombia. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 from Venezuelan migrants living in Colombia. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 from 30 clinical specimens collected from Venezuelan migrants were sequenced. Genomes were compared with the Wuhan-reference-genome to identify polymorphisms, reconstruct phylogenetic relationships, and perform comparative genomic analyses. Geographic, sociodemographic and clinical data were also studied across genotypes. RESULTS: We demonstrate the presence of six distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating among Venezuelan migrants, as well as the close relationship between SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences obtained from individuals living in the Venezuelan-Colombian border regions of La Guajira (Colombia) and Zulia (Venezuela). Three clusters (C1, C2 and C3) are well-supported by phylogenomic inference, supporting the hypothesis of three potential transmission routes across the Colombian-Venezuelan border. These genomes included point mutations previously associated with increased infectivity. A mutation (L18F) in the N-terminal domain of spike protein that has been associated with compromised binding of neutralizing antibodies was found in 2/30 (6%) of the genomes. We identified a statistically significant association with symptomatology for cluster C2. CONCLUSION: The close phylogenetic relationships between SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuelan migrants and from persons living at the Venezuela-Colombian border, supports the importance of human movements for the spread of COVID-19 and for emerging virus variants.

34227689	The safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma donation: A multi-institutional donor hemovigilance study. BACKGROUND: Although the safety and therapeutic efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) has been extensively evaluated, the safety of CCP donation has not been explored in a multi-institutional context. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine blood collection organizations (BCOs) participated in a multi-institutional donor hemovigilance effort to assess the safety of CCP donation. Donor adverse events (DAEs) were defined according to the Standard for Surveillance of Complications Related to Blood Donation, and severity was assessed using the severity grading tool. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine attributes associated with DAE severity. RESULTS: The overall DAE rate was 37.7 per 1000 donations. Repeat apheresis and apheresis-naive donors experienced adverse event rates of 19.9 and 49.8 per 1000 donations, respectively. Female donors contributed 51.9% of CCP donations with a DAE rate of 49.4 per 1000 donations. The DAE rate for male donors was 27.4 per 1000 donations. Vasovagal reactions accounted for over half of all reported DAEs (51.1%). After adjustment, volume of CCP donated was associated with vasovagal reaction severity (odds ratio [OR] 6.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.5-17.1). Donor age and donation history were also associated with DAE severity. Considerable differences in DAE types and rates were observed across the participating BCOs despite the use of standardized hemovigilance definitions. CONCLUSION: The safety of CCP donation appears comparable to that of conventional apheresis plasma donation with similar associated risk factors for DAE types and severity.	Prevention;Treatment
34213885	Structure-Guided Design of Conformationally Constrained Cyclohexane Inhibitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 3CL Protease. A series of nondeuterated and deuterated dipeptidyl aldehyde and masked aldehyde inhibitors that incorporate in their structure a conformationally constrained cyclohexane moiety was synthesized and found to potently inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 3CL protease in biochemical and cell-based assays. Several of the inhibitors were also found to be nanomolar inhibitors of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3CL protease. The corresponding latent aldehyde bisulfite adducts were found to be equipotent to the precursor aldehydes. High-resolution cocrystal structures confirmed the mechanism of action and illuminated the structural determinants involved in binding. The spatial disposition of the compounds disclosed herein provides an effective means of accessing new chemical space and optimizing pharmacological activity. The cellular permeability of the identified inhibitors and lack of cytotoxicity warrant their advancement as potential therapeutics for COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34334910	Assessment of materno-foetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2: A prospective pilot study. Background: The issue of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the foetus has not yet been resolved. Its main reason is lack of a bigger study to analyse this question. The evidence of the affection of the foetus during antenatal or intrapartum period is limited to some anecdotal reports. To look for the possibility of vertical transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to the foetus, this prospective pilot study was conducted at a tertiary health care COVID-19 designated centre of Armed Forces. Methods: This study was conducted during 01 June 2020 and 15 October 2020 and included 54 covid-positive pregnant mothers. During delivery, amniotic fluid and cord blood samples were collected in a sterile manner. Amniotic fluid samples were not collected during vaginal deliveries as chances of contamination was very high. These samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 gene by Reverse Transcriptasee Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, and the results were analysed. Newborns were allowed to room in with mother, and they underwent throat and nasal swab RT-PCR testing of covid within 24-48 h of delivery. Results: A total of 1520 pregnant mothers underwent RT-PCR test during the study period. Total positivity rate among our pregnant women was 2.8%. Out of 54 covid-positive women during the study period, amniotic fluid RT-PCR tests were carried out for 43 women, and cord blood was tested for 45 women. Conclusion: RT-PCR test of amniotic fluid, cord blood and nasal and throat swab of all newborns delivered by SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women were negative. Based on our study, the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be unlikely.	Diagnosis;Transmission
34214535	Role of spatial patterning of N-protein interactions in SARS-CoV-2 genome packaging. Viruses must efficiently and specifically package their genomes while excluding cellular nucleic acids and viral subgenomic fragments. Some viruses use specific packaging signals, which are conserved sequence or structure motifs present only in the full-length genome. Recent work has shown that viral proteins important for packaging can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), in which one or two viral nucleic acid binding proteins condense with the genome. The compositional simplicity of viral components lends itself well to theoretical modeling compared with more complex cellular organelles. Viral LLPS can be limited to one or two viral proteins and a single genome that is enriched in LLPS-promoting features. In our previous study, we observed that LLPS-promoting sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are located at the 5' and 3' ends of the genome, whereas the middle of the genome is predicted to consist mostly of solubilizing elements. Is this arrangement sufficient to drive single genome packaging, genome compaction, and genome cyclization? We addressed these questions using a coarse-grained polymer model, LASSI, to study the LLPS of nucleocapsid protein with RNA sequences that either promote LLPS or solubilization. With respect to genome cyclization, we find the most optimal arrangement restricts LLPS-promoting elements to the 5' and 3' ends of the genome, consistent with the native spatial patterning. Genome compaction is enhanced by clustered LLPS-promoting binding sites, whereas single genome packaging is most efficient when binding sites are distributed throughout the genome. These results suggest that many and variably positioned LLPS-promoting signals can support packaging in the absence of a singular packaging signal which argues against necessity of such a feature. We hypothesize that this model should be generalizable to multiple viruses as well as cellular organelles such as paraspeckles, which enrich specific long RNA sequences in a defined arrangement.

34201131	Rapid Inactivation In Vitro of SARS-CoV-2 in Saliva by Black Tea and Green Tea. Saliva plays major roles in the human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. If the virus in saliva in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals can be rapidly and efficiently inactivated by a beverage, the ingestion of the beverage may attenuate the spread of virus infection within a population. Recently, we reported that SARS-CoV-2 was significantly inactivated by treatment with black tea, green tea, roasted green tea and oolong tea, as well as their constituents, (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), theasinensin A (TSA), and galloylated theaflavins. However, it remains unclear to what extent tea inactivates the virus present in saliva, because saliva contains various proteins, nitrogenous products, electrolytes, and so on, which could influence the antivirus effect of tea. Here, we assessed whether tea inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 which was added in human saliva. A virus was added in healthy human saliva in vitro, and after treatment with black tea or green tea, the infectivity of the virus was evaluated by TCID50 assays. The virus titer fell below the detectable level or less than 1/100 after treatment with black tea or green tea for 10 s. The black tea-treated virus less remarkably replicated in cells compared with the untreated virus. These findings suggest the possibility that the ingestion of tea may inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in saliva in infected individuals, although clinical studies are required to determine the intensity and duration of the anti-viral effect of tea in saliva in humans.

34351888	Critically ill infant with multisystem inflammatory syndrome related to COVID-19. INTRODUCCION: La COVID-19 se ha convertido en una amenaza para la salud publica mundial. Sin embargo, las formas graves en ninos son poco frecuentes. Se presenta el caso de un lactante con sindrome inflamatorio multisistemico relacionado con COVID-19. CASO CLINICO: Lactante de 8 meses que estuvo en contacto con adultos positivos para COVID-19. El lactante inicio con una forma leve de la enfermedad que progreso con rapidez a una forma critica de presentacion inicialmente con estado epileptico, y a su ingreso con evidencia de inflamacion en laboratorios, afeccion sistemica grave con falla multiorganica y prueba de reaccion en cadena de la polimerasa para SARS-CoV-2 nasofaringea positiva. El lactante fallecio 7 dias despues de su ingreso. CONCLUSIONES: El espectro de presentacion de la COVID-19 en ninos menores de 1 ano es variable y aun no se cuentan con criterios consensuados para el diagnostico y el tratamiento. Todo lactante con enfermedad grave con compromiso multiorganico al ingreso en tiempos de pandemia obliga a realizar una meticulosa historia clinica y considerar la infeccion por SARS-CoV-2 hasta su confirmacion. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has become a threat to global public health. However, severe forms of COVID-19 presentation in children are rare. We present the case of an infant with COVID 19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of an 8-month-old infant who had contact with COVID-19 positive adults. The infant began with mild symptoms of the disease but rapidly progressed to a critical form of presentation:initially with epileptic status, and upon admission with laboratory evidence of inflammation, severe systemic condition with multiple organ failure, and a positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The infant died 7 days after admission. CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of COVID-19 presentation in children under one year of age is variable, and there are still no established criteria for diagnosis and treatment. All infants presenting a severe disease with multiple organ involvement at admission in times of pandemic require a thorough medical history to consider SARS-CoV-2 infection until proven otherwise.

34368789	Teledermatology in the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review. Background: Teledermatology (TD) has emerged as a critical way of delivering care remotely in the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: We conducted a systematic review to assess how TD has been implemented worldwide. Methods: We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, Web of Science and Google Scholar for articles on the use of TD for patient care, written in English and published from December 1(st) 2019 to October 15(th) 2020. Results: 27 studies were included, involving 16,981 patients. There was significant uptake of TD during the pandemic. Synchronous TD appeared to be more commonly implemented than asynchronous TD. Common ambulatory dermatoses such as acne or eczema were reported to be more amenable to TD assessment and management. TD also appeared to be useful for the diagnosis of cutaneous involvement of COVID-19 infection and follow-up of stable onco-dermatology cases. Limitations: Pooled analysis of all relevant outcomes was not always possible due to the heterogeneity in methodologies of included studies. Conclusions: TD is a useful and convenient tool for the management of common ambulatory dermatoses in the COVID-19 pandemic.	Prevention
34293539	Thrombotic risk in children with COVID-19 infection: A systematic review of the literature. OBJECTIVE: Coagulation and inflammatory parameters are mildly altered in children with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection, and laboratory evidence of a proinflammatory and procoagulant state has been noted in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). It is not clear whether this pediatric condition is related to thrombotic events. With this study we reviewed the literature for thrombotic complications in children with COVID-19 infection and MIS-C. DATA SOURCES: We searched the Medline PubMed Advanced Search Builder, Scopus, Web Of Science, and Google Scholar electronic databases (until 1 January 2021) using the medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and text words (their combinations and truncated synonyms): (THROMBOSIS OR THROMBOPHILIA) AND (CHILD OR CHILDREN OR INFANT) AND (COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2). STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were children with COVID-19 or SARS-COV-2 infection. The search was limited to articles published in English. Exclusion criteria were: reviews of published studies, studies published only as abstracts, letters or conference proceedings, discussion papers, animal studies, or editorials. RESULTS: After screening for duplicates, the initial search yielded 86 records: 12 were case reports involving 19 children; comorbidities were absent or mild in 73.7%. The most common site of thrombosis the lung (21%); the most often used drug was heparin (42%). Two studies were an international survey (n = 337 patients) and a large multicenter study (n = 186 patients with MIS-C). The risk of ischemic stroke in SARS-CoV-2 infection (0.82%) and deep venous thrombosis in MIS-C (4.3%) was lower in children than in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombodic or thromboembolic events are rare in pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection and MIS-C. Nonetheless, as in adults, a high index of suspicion should be maintained in children with COVID-19 infection or MIS-C, particularly in those with comorbidities predisposing to thrombotic events.

34203657	Contagion Management at the Mediterranee Infection University Hospital Institute. The Mediterranee Infection University Hospital Institute (IHU) is located in a recent building, which includes experts on a wide range of infectious disease. The IHU strategy is to develop innovative tools, including epidemiological monitoring, point-of-care laboratories, and the ability to mass screen the population. In this study, we review the strategy and guidelines proposed by the IHU and its application to the COVID-19 pandemic and summarise the various challenges it raises. Early diagnosis enables contagious patients to be isolated and treatment to be initiated at an early stage to reduce the microbial load and contagiousness. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to deal with a shortage of personal protective equipment and reagents and a massive influx of patients. Between 27 January 2020 and 5 January 2021, 434,925 nasopharyngeal samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Of them, 12,055 patients with COVID-19 were followed up in our out-patient clinic, and 1888 patients were hospitalised in the Institute. By constantly adapting our strategy to the ongoing situation, the IHU has succeeded in expanding and upgrading its equipment and improving circuits and flows to better manage infected patients.

We analyze the disease control and prevention strategies in a susceptible-infectious-quarantined-diseased (SIQD) model with a quarantine-adjusted incidence function. We have established the closed-form solutions for all the variables of SIQD model with a quarantine-adjusted incidence function provided beta not equal gamma + alpha by utilizing the classical techniques of solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The epidemic peak and time required to attain this peak are provided in closed form. We have provided closed-form expressions for force of infection and rate at which susceptible becomes infected. The management of epidemic perceptive using control and prevention strategies is explained as well. The epidemic starts when rho 0 > 1, the peak of epidemic appears when number of infected attains peak value when rho 0 = 1 , and the disease dies out rho 0 < 1. We have provided the comparison of estimated and actual epidemic peak of COVID-19 in Pakistan. The forecast of epidemic peak for the United states, Brazil, India, and the Syrian Arab Republic is given as well.	Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
34203844	SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity and Severity of COVID-19 According to SARS-CoV-2 Variants: Current Evidence. BACKGROUND: We conducted this review to summarize the relation between viral mutation and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and also the severity of COVID-19 in vivo and in vitro. METHOD: Articles were identified through a literature search until 31 May 2021, in PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. RESULTS: Sixty-three studies were included. To date, most studies showed that the viral mutations, especially the D614G variant, correlate with a higher infectivity than the wild-type virus. However, the evidence of the association between viral mutation and severity of the disease is scant. A SARS-CoV-2 variant with a 382-nucleotide deletion was associated with less severe infection in patients. The 11,083G > U mutation was significantly associated with asymptomatic patients. By contrast, ORF1ab 4715L and S protein 614G variants were significantly more frequent in patients from countries where high fatality rates were also reported. The current evidence showed that variants of concern have led to increased infectivity and deteriorating epidemiological situations. However, the relation between this variant and severity of COVID-19 infection was contradictory. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread worldwide. It is necessary to anticipate large clinical cohorts to evaluate the virulence and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 mutants.	Mechanism;Transmission

34290535	The COVID-19 Lockdown and CPAP Adherence: The More Vulnerable Ones Less Likely to Improve Adherence? Purpose: Due to the possible interplay of factors predisposing to severe COVID-19 outcomes and negative health consequences of poorly controlled OSA, adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy among OSA patients might be crucial during COVID-19 pandemics. Lockdown-related changes in CPAP adherence were investigated in CPAP users willing to participate in this study. Pre-lockdown adherence, age, gender, comorbidities and anxiety were analyzed as predictors of COVID-19 lockdown adherence. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study performed at Split Sleep Medicine Center included 101 severe OSA patients (78.2% male). CPAP memory cards were assessed during 6 months of pre-lockdown and 40 days of lockdown (March/April 2020) period. A total of 81 patients in pre-lockdown met good CPAP adherence criteria (>/=4 hours/night on 70% nights). Results: CPAP adherence improved during COVID-19 lockdown in the total sample of severe OSA patients. The percentage of adherent nights and CPAP usage hours per night increased during lockdown in good pre-lockdown CPAP adherers (p=0.011 and p=0.001, respectively), women (p=0.003 and p=0.001, respectively) and respondents younger than 58 years (p=0.007 and p<0.001, respectively). Out of 20/101 poor pre-lockdown CPAP adherers, 9 have shifted to good lockdown adherence. When comorbidities, BMI and anxiety were taken into account, older and male respondents were recognized as less likely to improve CPAP usage hours during lockdown (R(2)=9.4%; p=0.032). Conclusion: The lockdown-related CPAP adherence improved in severe OSA patients, with a shift in almost half of poor pre-lockdown adherers towards good lockdown CPAP adherence. Women, younger and good pre-lockdown CPAP adherers were more adherent during lockdown. Despite being vulnerable groups for both OSA and COVID-19, no expected adherence improvements were observed in men and older patients.	Prevention
34207199	"Photobiomodulation Therapy as a Possible New Approach in COVID-19: A Systematic Review. COVID-19 is a viral disease characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Since then, researchers from all over the world have been looking for ways to fight this disease. Many cases of complications arise from insufficient immune responses due to low immunity, with intense release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can damage the structure of organs such as the lung. Thus, the hypothesis arises that photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) with the use of a low-level laser (LLLT) may be an ally approach to patients with COVID-19 since it is effective for increasing immunity, helping tissue repair, and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. This systematic review was performed with the use of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar databases with the following keywords: ""low-level laser therapy OR photobiomodulation therapy AND COVID-19"". The inclusion criteria were complete articles published from January 2020 to January 2021 in English. The exclusion criteria were other languages, editorials, reviews, brief communications, letters to the editor, comments, conference abstracts, and articles that did not provide the full text. The bibliographic search found 18 articles in the Pubmed/MEDLINE database, 118 articles on the Web of Science, 23 articles on Scopus, and 853 articles on Google Scholar. Ten articles were included for qualitative synthesis, of which four commentary articles discussed the pathogenesis and the effect of PBMT in COVID-19. Two in vitro and lab experiments showed the effect of PBMT on prevention of thrombosis and positive results in wound healing during viral infection, using the intravascular irradiation (ILIB) associated with Phthalomethyl D. Two case reports showed PBMT improved the respiratory indexes, radiological findings, and inflammatory markers in severe COVID-19 patients. One case series reported the clinical improvement after PBMT on 14 acute COVID-19 patients, rehabilitation on 24 patients, and as a preventive treatment on 70 people. One clinical trial of 30 patients with severe COVID-19 who require invasive mechanical ventilation, showed PBMT-static magnetic field was not statistically different from placebo for the length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit, but improved diaphragm muscle function and ventilation and decreased the inflammatory markers. This review suggests that PBMT may have a positive role in treatment of COVID-19. Still, the necessity for more clinical trials remains in this field and there is not sufficient research evidence regarding the effects of PBMT and COVID-19 disease, and there is a large gap."

34226505	H-Ras gene takes part to the host immune response to COVID-19. Ras gene family members play a relevant role in cancer, especially when they are mutated. However, they may play additional roles in other conditions beside cancer. We performed gene expression analysis using the NanoString PanCancer IO 360 panel in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of six COVID-19 patients and we found that H-Ras gene was significantly upregulated, while both K-Ras and N-Ras genes were downregulated. In particular, H-Ras gene upregulation was more evident in COVID-19 patients with a more severe disease. We compared our results with those obtained by analyzing two different and independent datasets, including a total of 53 COVID-19 patients, in which the gene expression analysis was performed using the Immunology_V2 panel. Comparative analysis of the H-Ras gene expression in these patients confirmed our preliminary results. In both of them, in fact, we were able to confirm the upregulation of the expression of the H-Ras gene. The exact role of this specific upregulation of the H-Ras gene in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its possible role in cancer still remains to be elucidated. In conclusion, H-Ras gene participates to the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, especially in patients affected by the most severe form of the COVID-19.	Mechanism
34287504	Time course of exercise capacity in patients recovering from COVID-19-associated pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: High prevalences of muscle weakness and impaired physical performance in hospitalized patients recovering from COVID-19-associated pneumonia have been reported. Our objective was to determine whether the level of exercise capacity after discharge would affect long-term functional outcomes in these patients. METHODS: From three to five weeks after discharge from acute care hospitals (T0), patients underwent a six-minute walk test (6MWT) and were divided into two groups according to the distance walked in percentage of predicted values: <75% group and >/=75% group. At T0 and three months later (T1), patients completed the Short Physical Performance Battery and the Euro Quality of Life Visual Analogue Scale, and pulmonary function and respiratory muscle function were assessed. In addition, a repeat 6MWT was also performed at T1. RESULTS: At T0, 6MWD values and Short Physical Performance Battery scores were lower in the <75% group than in the >/=75% group. No differences were found in the Euro Quality of Life Visual Analogue Scale scores, pulmonary function variables, respiratory muscle function variables, length of hospital stay, or previous treatment. At T1, both groups improved their exercise capacity, but only the subjects in the <75% group showed significant improvements in dyspnea and lower extremity function. Exercise capacity and functional status values returned to predicted values in all of the patients in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Four weeks after discharge, COVID-19 survivors with exercise limitation showed no significant differences in physiological or clinical characteristics or in perceived health status when compared with patients without exercise limitation.

The aim of this study was the characterization of COVID-19 cases detected during this period. METHODS: We analyzed certain variables of interest coming from the epidemiological surveys carried out in an area of Madrid during May 2020, and stratified the results depending on its temporal relation with the deescalation. Prevalence for each category of response and average duration in minutes of the telephonic call were calculated. Confidence intervals were estimated at 95%. RESULTS: We included 167 cases, being 30.5% of them incident and 49.1% prevalent. The main source of infection was home (38.0%; CI 95% 31.4-46.2). Regarding healthcare and social care workers, the main source of infection was workplace (93.0%; 85.4-100). Average number of close contacts per case was 2.0 (1.8-2.2), being 1.5 (1.0-2.0) among pre-deescalation incident cases and 2.4 (1.8-3.0) among those post-deescalation. Average duration of each survey was 35.9 minutes (32.2-38.9), being 32.1 (24.4-39.8) among pre-deescalation incident cases and 37.0 (29.6-44.4) among those post-deescalation. Most of the contacts were household, both before and after beginning of deescalation. CONCLUSIONS: Home is the most prevalent place for the acquisition of the infection among general population, while workplace is the most prevalent among healthcare and social care workers. The initial phase of deescalation do not represents a change regarding sources of infection, but it may increase the number of close contacts.	Prevention;Transmission

34287774	Estimation of Admission D-dimer Cut-off Value to Predict Venous Thrombotic Events in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: Analysis of the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry. BACKGROUND: Venous thrombotic events (VTE) are frequent in COVID-19, and elevated plasma D-dimer (pDd) and dyspnea are common in both entities. OBJECTIVE: To determine the admission pDd cut-off value associated with in-hospital VTE in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Multicenter, retrospective study analyzing the at-admission pDd cut-off value to predict VTE and anticoagulation intensity along hospitalization due to COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 9386 patients, 2.2% had VTE: 1.6% pulmonary embolism (PE), 0.4% deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and 0.2% both. Those with VTE had a higher prevalence of tachypnea (42.9% vs. 31.1%; p = 0.0005), basal O2 saturation <93% (45.4% vs. 33.1%; p = 0.0003), higher at admission pDd (median [IQR]: 1.4 [0.6-5.5] vs. 0.6 [0.4-1.2] mug/ml; p < 0.0001) and platelet count (median [IQR]: 208 [158-289] vs. 189 [148-245] platelets x 10(9)/L; p = 0.0013). A pDd cut-off of 1.1 mug/ml showed specificity 72%, sensitivity 49%, positive predictive value (PPV) 4%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 99% for in-hospital VTE. A cut-off value of 4.7 mug/ml showed specificity of 95%, sensitivity of 27%, PPV of 9%, and NPV of 98%. Overall mortality was proportional to pDd value, with the lowest incidence for each pDd category depending on anticoagulation intensity: 26.3% for those with pDd >1.0 mug/ml treated with prophylactic dose (p < 0.0001), 28.8% for pDd for patients with pDd >2.0 mug/ml treated with intermediate dose (p = 0.0001), and 31.3% for those with pDd >3.0 mug/ml and full anticoagulation (p = 0.0183). CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a pDd value greater than 3.0 mug/ml can be considered to screen VTE and to consider full-dose anticoagulation.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34346720	Elevated Rates of Indeterminate Results on QuantiFERON(R)-TB Gold Plus in COVID-19 Patients. Interferon-gamma release assays are used to screen various patient populations for latent tuberculosis infection. In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, Ward et al. (J Clin Microbiol 59:e00811-21, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.00811-21) investigated an increased indeterminate rate in the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay among COVID-19 patients that was independent of immunosuppressive agents and lymphopenia. In their study, COVID-19 patients with indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus results trended toward decreased survival as well as increased serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels, though the differences were not statistically significant. They suggest that this pattern of cytokine expression supports an impairment of Th1, and specifically interferon-gamma production, in critically ill COVID-19 patients, as indicated by indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus results. Clinicians should be aware of the increased rate of indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus results in critically ill COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34287571	Association of Hypertension with Severity and Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A Single-centered, Retrospective Study. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread worldwide. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between hypertension and severity/mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. METHODS: A total of 337 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, from January 20 to February 25, 2020, were enrolled and analyzed in a retrospective, single-center case study. The significance level adopted in the statistical analysis was 0.05. RESULTS: Of the 337 patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, 297 (87.8%) were discharged from the hospital and 40 patients (22.9%) died. The median age was 58 years (range, 18-91 years). There were 112 (33.2%) patients diagnosed with hypertension at admission (median age, 65.0 years [range, 38-91 years]; 67 [59.8%, 95%CI: 50.6%-69.0%] men, p=0.0209). Patients with hypertension presented a significantly higher portion of severe cases (69 [61.6%, 95%CI:52.5%-70.8%] vs. 117 [52.0%, 95%CI: 45.4%-58.6%] in severe patients and 23 [19.3%, 95%CI:12.9%-28.1%] vs. 27 [12.0%, 95%CI: 7.7%-16.3%] in critical patients, p=0.0014) and higher mortality rates (20 [17.9%, 95%CI: 10.7%-25.1%] vs. 20 [8.9%, 95%CI: 5.1%-12.6%, p=0.0202). Moreover, hypertensive patients presented abnormal levels of multiple indicators, such as lymphopenia, inflammation, heart, liver, kidney, and lung function at admission. The hypertension group still displayed higher levels of TnT and creatinine at approaching discharge. CONCLUSION: Hypertension is strongly associated with severity or mortality of COVID-19. Aggressive treatment may be considered for COVID-19 patients with hypertension, especially regarding cardiac and kidney injury.	Diagnosis;Treatment

34228112	Theory of Planned Behavior Analysis of Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Focusing on the Intention-Behavior Gap. BACKGROUND: As COVID-19 continues to spread globally, it is important to understand psychological factors that may influence compliance with social distancing. PURPOSE: The present study examined whether Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constructs were associated with social distancing, with a focus on exploring moderators of the intention-behavior relationship. METHODS: Using a longitudinal design, U.S. adults (N = 507) self-reported TPB constructs and social distancing behavior at baseline and 3 months later. Participants were from 48 U.S. States and the District of Columbia and were on average 50.39 years old (SD = 15.32, range = 18-80). The majority were Non-Hispanic White (71.6%), had a bachelor's degree or higher (55.3%), and resided in suburban areas (55.8%). RESULTS: While positive attitudes toward social distancing increased over time (p = .002), subjective norms weakened (p < .001) and perceived behavioral control (PBC) remained stable (p = .22). Interestingly, despite an increase in intentions from baseline to follow-up (p < .001), there was a significant decrease in social distancing behavior over time (p < .001). Consistent with the TPB, baseline attitudes (p < .001), subjective norms (p < .001), and PBC (p < .001) for social distancing were all associated with baseline intentions to social distance. In turn, baseline intentions were significantly associated with social distancing behavior at follow-up (p < .001). Younger adults (p < .001) and non-White participants (p = .002) displayed a greater intention-behavior gap relative to older and White participants. In contrast, participants with more stable intentions over time displayed a stronger intention-behavior relationship (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Targeting individuals' attitudes, norms, and PBC may effectively promote protective behaviors intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and similar viral outbreaks. Future research should examine effective strategies for translating social distancing intentions into actions.	Prevention
34336443	"A Novel Just-In-Time-Online-Training for Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimen Collection During the COVID-19 Pandemic. INTRODUCTION: The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is controlled by timely detection of infected patients using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab test, followed by isolation and treatment. One challenge encountered with NP swab collection was to train healthcare providers (HCPs) with different training backgrounds and experience for collecting NP swab specimens across Nebraska, including a sizeable rural area. In-person training for NP swab collection skills was challenging due to social distancing. We developed a Just-In-Time-Online Training (JITOT) and delivered it using Facebook Live (TM) to meet our HCPs' training needs. METHODS: Online training was held on April 21, 2020, and attended by 453 HCPs. A quasi-experimental study based on a survey and a multiple choice questionnaire (MCQ) was conducted to evaluate its effectiveness in improving the participants' knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS: Group mean knowledge score increased from a pre-test score of 57%-95% in the post-test showing a large effect size (Hedges' g = 0.976877). On a five-point Likert scale, the majority (86.21%) of the survey respondents agreed/strongly agreed that this training increased their overall comfort for nasal swab specimen collection as compared to their pre-training comfort (37.93%) with this procedure. The majority of respondents (96.55%) in the post-training evaluation agreed/strongly agreed that ""the delivery method was appropriate."" CONCLUSION: A JITOT session is helpful to teach, demonstrate, clarify doubts, and improve the knowledge and comfort of the participants. It can be quickly delivered using a free social media platform for broader outreach during public health emergencies."	Prevention
34283876	COVID-19 cumulative incidence, asymptomatic infections, and fatality in Long Island, NY, January-August 2020: A cohort of World Trade Center responders. BACKGROUND: New York City and Long Island, NY were early foci of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US. The effects of COVID-19 on different sub-populations, and its key epidemiologic parameters remain unknown or highly uncertain. We investigated the epidemiology of COVID-19 from January to August of 2020 in an established academic monitoring cohort of N = 9,697 middle-aged World Trade Center responders residing in Long Island, NY. METHODS: A seroprevalence survey and a series of cross-sectional surveys were nested in a prospective cohort study. Measures included IgG antibody testing, SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, review of electronic medical records, and surveys of symptoms. Correlates of infection were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The cohort was predominantly men in their mid-fifties; 6,597 cohort members were successfully contacted (68%); 1,042 (11%) individuals participated in the seroprevalence survey; and 369 individuals (5.6% of 6,597 study participants) underwent PCR testing. The estimated standardized cumulative incidence was 21.9% (95%CI: 20.1-23.9%), the asymptomatic proportion was 16.4% (36/219; 95%CI: 11.8-22.0%), the case hospitalization ratio was 9.4% (36/385; 95%CI: 6.6-12.7%), the case fatality ratio was 1.8% (7/385; 95%CI: 0.7-3.7%), and the hospitalization fatality ratio was 8.3% (3/36; 95%CI: 1.8-22.5%). Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with younger age, race/ethnicity, and being currently employed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest a high cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among WTC responders in the spring and summer of 2020 and contribute to narrowing the plausible range of the proportion of infections that exhibit no symptoms. An increased risk of infection among younger employed individuals is likely to reflect a higher probability of exposure to the virus, and the racial disparities in the infection risk warrant further investigation.

34373623	Progress of the COVID-19 vaccine effort: viruses, vaccines and variants versus efficacy, effectiveness and escape. Where 2020 saw the development and testing of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at an unprecedented pace, the first half of 2021 has seen vaccine rollout in many countries. In this Progress article, we provide a snapshot of ongoing vaccine efficacy studies, as well as real-world data on vaccine effectiveness and the impact of virus variants of concern. Where they have been deployed in a high proportion of the adult population, the currently approved vaccines have been extremely effective in preventing COVID-19, particularly severe disease. Nonetheless, there are still significant challenges in ensuring equitable vaccine access around the globe and lessons that can be learned for controlling this pandemic and for the next pandemic.

34198865	Nano-Microparticle Platforms in Developing Next-Generation Vaccines. The first vaccines ever made were based on live-attenuated or inactivated pathogens, either whole cells or fragments. Although these vaccines required the co-administration of antigens with adjuvants to induce a strong humoral response, they could only elicit a poor CD8(+) T-cell response. In contrast, next-generation nano/microparticle-based vaccines offer several advantages over traditional ones because they can induce a more potent CD8(+) T-cell response and, at the same time, are ideal carriers for proteins, adjuvants, and nucleic acids. The fact that these nanocarriers can be loaded with molecules able to modulate the immune response by inducing different effector functions and regulatory activities makes them ideal tools for inverse vaccination, whose goal is to shut down the immune response in autoimmune diseases. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and liposomes are biocompatible materials approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use and are, therefore, suitable for nanoparticle-based vaccines. Recently, another candidate platform for innovative vaccines based on extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been shown to efficiently co-deliver antigens and adjuvants. This review will discuss the potential use of PLGA-NPs, liposomes, and EVs as carriers of peptides, adjuvants, mRNA, and DNA for the development of next-generation vaccines against endemic and emerging viruses in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

34281950	Sequential contralateral facial nerve palsies following COVID-19 vaccination first and second doses. A 61-year-old man presented to the ENT emergency clinic with a history of unilateral facial nerve palsy occurring shortly after each dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The first episode developed 5 hours after administration of the first dose and the second 2 days after administration of the second dose. Investigations at initial presentation to the emergency department were unremarkable, and the patient was diagnosed with Bell's palsy on both occasions. We describe the first case of Bell's palsy occurring after each dose of any UK-approved COVID-19 vaccine. Single episodes of unilateral facial nerve palsies have been reported in clinical trials and in subsequent case reports. There has been no evidence, however, of an episode after each dose. We also describe the earliest onset of symptoms from timing of administration of the vaccine, further suggesting the Bell's palsy was associated with the vaccine.	Case Report
34210744	2020 Year in Review: Shared Ventilation for COVID-19. COVID-19 resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a pandemic of respiratory failure previously unencountered. Early in the pandemic, concentrated infections in high-density population cities threatened to overwhelm health systems, and ventilator shortages were predicted. An early proposed solution was the use of shared ventilation, or the use of a single ventilator to support >/= 2 patients. Spurred by ill-conceived social media posts, the idea spread in the lay press. Prior to 2020, there were 7 publications on this topic. A year later, more than 40 publications have addressed the technical details for shared ventilation, clinical experience with shared ventilation, as well as the numerous limitations and ethics of the technique. This is a review of the literature regarding shared ventilation from peer-reviewed articles published in 2020.	Treatment
34375702	Occupational COVID-19 Exposures and Secondary Cases among Healthcare Personnel. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare personnel (HCP) have been at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, both from patients and co-workers. This paper summarizes occupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2 and secondary cases among HCP at a large health system. Key findings indicate that transmission of COVID-19 to HCP is low, especially with close adherence to PPE guidelines, but lapses in infection prevention practices, including dining together and omitting eye protection during patient care, especially at times when COVID-19 is circulating widely in the community increase the risk of exposure and subsequent transmission to HCP.

34292420	Urgent surgery for COVID-19-positive pediatric patient. BACKGROUND: We present a case of COVID-19-positive pediatric patient for urgent urological surgery by spinal anesthesia to avoid aerosolizing procedure. CASE PRESENTATION: A 12-year-old, COVID-19-positive boy presented for urgent wound incision and drainage at the circumcision site. Our anesthetic plan consisted of spinal anesthesia with sedation. He was transported from the COVID-19 isolation floor to the negative pressure operating room. He was placed in lateral decubitus position and oxygen was delivered through facemask. Under sedation, spinal anesthesia was achieved at first attempt. The patient maintained spontaneous ventilation without airway intervention. Patient was recovered in the operation room then transported back to the floor. CONCLUSION: Spinal anesthesia is a safe alternative to general endotracheal anesthesia for many pediatric urology procedures. Effective team communication and preparation are keys when caring COVID-19-positive patient in perioperative setting to avoid minimize the risk to healthcare providers.	Case Report
34208212	Sero-Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in High-Risk Populations in Vietnam. As a response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Vietnam enforced strict quarantine, contact tracing and physical distancing policies resulting in one of the lowest numbers of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) globally. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity among high-risk populations in Vietnam. A prevalence survey was undertaken within four communities in Vietnam, where at least two COVID-19 cases had been confirmed. Participants were classified according to the location of exposure: household contacts, close contacts, community members, and healthcare workers (HCWs) responsible for treating COVID-19 cases. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were quantified using a commercial assay. A total of 3049 community members and 149 health care workers consented to the study. Among 13 individuals who were seropositive (0.4%), five household contacts (5/27, 18.5%), one close contact (1/53, 1.9%), and seven community members (7/2954, 0.2%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All HCWs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Participants were tested a median of 15.1 (interquartile range from 14.9 to 15.2) weeks after exposure. Our study found a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in high-risk communities and healthcare workers in communities in Vietnam with known COVID-19 cases.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34223610	Predicting COVID-19 health behaviour initiation, consistency, interruptions and discontinuation among social media users in Nigeria. Literature on the predictors of health behaviour initiation, interruption, consistency and discontinuation is scarce. This study sought to fill this gap by suggesting a model that takes into account these variables. Using the structural equation modelling, we surveyed 470 social media users in Nigeria and found that perceived vulnerability, perceived seriousness; benefits to action, self-efficacy and cues to action significantly predict health behaviour initiation. Also, the predictors of health interruption were found to be perceived vulnerability, perceived seriousness, benefits to action, challenges to action and perceived realness. The predictors of health behaviour consistency were found to be perceived vulnerability, perceived seriousness, benefits to action, perceived realness, self-efficacy and cues to action. Finally, the predictors of health behaviour discontinuation were found to be perceived vulnerability, perceived seriousness, perception on realness, behaviour fatigue and behaviour discomfort. We explored the implication of these results on health promotion and made suggestions for further studies.	Prevention
34208739	The Impact of and Government Planning and Responses to Pandemics for People with Disability: A Rapid Review. Objective-To collate evidence on (1) the risk of infection for people with disability during infectious disease outbreaks and/or pandemics and (2) government responses and pandemic plans for people with disability. Methods-Through two rapid reviews, relevant peer-reviewed studies and grey literature published from 2002 onwards in the English language were identified. Data were synthesised narratively. Results-Aim 1: Of the 680 studies, two studies were included in the review. No grey literature was eligible for inclusion. The evidence regarding risk was inconclusive. Aim 2: Of the 50 studies, three peer-review studies, along with four government reports were included. The literature largely reported on measures being taken to maximise the prevention of transmission of COVID-19 for the general population, with only a few programs including people with disability. Conclusion-Overall, there is inconclusive evidence on the risk of infection for people with disability during infectious disease outbreaks and/or pandemics and the government preparedness and planning for disease outbreaks and/or pandemics largely exclude people with disability. From a population health perspective, during disease outbreaks and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the general population, it is important for governments to include people with disability in their pandemic planning and response.

34211653	A successful case of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for COVID-19: walking home without oxygen supplementation. Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhan, China in December 2019 and is the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Approximately one-third of the patients with COVID-19 require intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and almost 30% of the patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used as salvage therapy for severe ARDS. The role of ECMO in the treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear, although there is emerging evidence that this approach may be an effective salvage therapy for severe ARDS. Case Presentation: We present a case of a previously healthy 39-year-old Hispanic male who presented to the hospital with flu-like symptoms, including headache, fatigue, and myalgia for 8 days in late April 2020. He denied dyspnea on exertion. The patient's symptoms progressed, resulting in pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was managed with prone positioning, convalescent plasma and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) for 35 days. The patient successfully recovered and was able to ambulate independently and was discharged home from an acute care hospital without oxygen supplementation on hospital day 63. Conclusion: We present one of the first few documented cases of ECMO for severe ARDS due to COVID-19. After a prolonged hospital course requiring VV-ECMO, the patient was discharged home from an acute care hospital without oxygen requirement and ambulated independently, likely as a result of daily aggressive mobility-focused rehabilitation.

34291223	Methylprednisolone and 60 Days in Hospital Survival in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia. OBJECTIVES: To determine methylprednisolone's dose, duration, and administration from onset of symptoms and association with 60 days in hospital survival of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Thirteen hospitals in New Jersey, United States during March to June 2020. PATIENTS: Seven-hundred fifty-nine hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients. INTERVENTIONS: We performed a propensity matched cohort study between patients who received methylprednisolone and no methylprednisolone. Patients in the methylprednisolone group were further differentiated into dose (high dose and low dose), duration, and administration from onset of symptoms. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the propensity matched sample, 99 out of 380 (26%) in no methylprednisolone, 69 out of 215 (31.9%) in low-dose methylprednisolone, and 74 out of 164 (55.2%) high-dose methylprednisolone expired. Overall median survival for no methylprednisolone (25.0 d), low-dose methylprednisolone (39.0 d), high-dose methylprednisolone (20.0 d), less than or equal to 7 days duration (19.0 d), 7-14 days duration (30.0 d), greater than 14 days duration (44.0 d), onset of symptoms less than or equal to 7 days (20.0 d), and onset of symptoms 7-14 days (27.0 d) were statistically significant (log-rank p </= 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression showed nursing home residents, coronary artery disease, and invasive mechanical ventilation were independently associated with mortality. Methylprednisolone was associated with reduced mortality compared with no methylprednisolone (hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.27-0.59; p < 0.001) but no added benefit with high dose. Low-dose methylprednisolone for 7-14 days was associated with reduced mortality compared with less than or equal to 7 days (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.22-0.91; p = 0.0273), and no additional benefit if greater than 14 days (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.60-2.69; p = 0.5434). Combination therapy with tocilizumab was associated with reduced mortality over monotherapy (p < 0.0116). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose methylprednisolone was associated with reduced mortality if given greater than 7 days from onset of symptoms, and no additional benefit greater than 14 days. High dose was associated with higher mortality.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34214046	Chimeric spike mRNA vaccines protect against Sarbecovirus challenge in mice. The emergence of SARS-CoV in 2003 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 highlights the need to develop universal vaccination strategies against the broader Sarbecovirus subgenus. Using chimeric spike designs, we demonstrate protection against challenge from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351, bat CoV (Bt-CoV) RsSHC014, and a heterologous Bt-CoV WIV-1 in vulnerable aged mice. Chimeric spike mRNAs induced high levels of broadly protective neutralizing antibodies against high-risk Sarbecoviruses. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination not only showed a marked reduction in neutralizing titers against heterologous Sarbecoviruses, but SARS-CoV and WIV-1 challenge in mice resulted in breakthrough infections. Chimeric spike mRNA vaccines efficiently neutralized D614G, mink cluster five, and the UK B.1.1.7., and South African B.1.351 variants of concern. Thus, multiplexed-chimeric spikes can prevent SARS-like zoonotic coronavirus infections with pandemic potential.	Mechanism;Treatment
34228433	Lipopeptides for Vaccine Development. The development of lipopeptides (lipidated peptides) for vaccines is discussed, including their role as antigens and/or adjuvants. Distinct classes of lipopeptide architectures are covered including simple linear and ligated constructs and lipid core peptides. The design, synthesis, and immunological responses of the important class of glycerol-based Toll-like receptor agonist lipopeptides such as Pam3CSK4, which contains three palmitoyl chains and a CSK4 hexapeptide sequence, and many derivatives of this model immunogenic compound are also reviewed. Self-assembled lipopeptide structures including spherical and worm-like micelles that have been shown to act as vaccine agents are also described. The work discussed includes examples of lipopeptides developed with model antigens, as well as for immunotherapies to treat many infectious diseases including malaria, influenza, hepatitis, COVID-19, and many others, as well as cancer immunotherapies. Some of these have proceeded to clinical development. The research discussed highlights the huge potential of, and diversity of roles for, lipopeptides in contemporary and future vaccine development.

34205888	The Beauty of Simplicity: Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity Reaction to Measure Cellular Immune Responses in RNA-SARS-Cov-2 Vaccinated Individuals. BACKGROUND: Monitoring cellular immune responses elicited in vaccinated individuals is highly complicated. METHODS: 28 individuals participated during the vaccination process with 12 BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer) vaccine. Specific anti-RBD IgG using a classic ELISA was performed in days 10 and 20 (after one dose of the vaccine) and on day 35 (after two vaccine doses) in serum samples of all participants. In parallel, DTH (delayed-type hypersensitivity) Skin Test using S protein was performed before (11/28) and after two doses (28/28) of the vaccine. RESULTS: 6/28 individuals were considered positive for the specific anti-RBD IgG positive at day 10, whereas all 28 individuals were positive at day 20. Moreover, 28/28 individuals increased the OD ratios at day 36 (2 doses). DTH cutaneous test was performed on 11/28 participants at day 20 (1 dose) showing 8/11 a positive reaction at 12 h. DTH of all participants was performed on day 36 (2 doses), showing 28/28 positive reactions at 12 h. CONCLUSION: This report describes the first publication of the results obtained using an in vivo method, the classical DTH response to the Spike protein to assess T-cell immune responses in vaccinated individuals. This affordable and simple test would help to answer basic immunogenicity questions on large-scale population vaccine studies.	Diagnosis;Treatment

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic since March 2020. This disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The only available tools to avoid contamination and transmission of this virus are physical distancing, the use of N95 and surgical masks, and hand hygiene. Vaccines are another essential tool to reduce the impact of the pandemic, though these present challenges in terms of production and logistics, particularly in underdeveloped and developing countries. One of the critical early research findings is the interaction of the spike virus protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) human receptor. Developing strategies to block this interaction has therefore been identified as a way to treat this infection. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) have emerged as a therapeutic approach since the pandemic started. Infected patients may be asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms, and others may evolve to moderate or severe disease, leading to death. An immunological phenomenon known as cytokine storm has been observed in patients with severe disease characterized by a proinflammatory cytokine cascade response that leads to lung injury. Thus, some treatment strategies focus on anti-cytokine storm nAbs. This review summarizes the latest advances in research and clinical trials, challenges, and perspectives on antibody-based treatments (ABT) as therapies against COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34226646	Critical fluctuations in epidemic models explain COVID-19 post-lockdown dynamics. As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, research on mathematical modeling became imperative and very influential to understand the epidemiological dynamics of disease spreading. The momentary reproduction ratio r(t) of an epidemic is used as a public health guiding tool to evaluate the course of the epidemic, with the evolution of r(t) being the reasoning behind tightening and relaxing control measures over time. Here we investigate critical fluctuations around the epidemiological threshold, resembling new waves, even when the community disease transmission rate [Formula: see text] is not significantly changing. Without loss of generality, we use simple models that can be treated analytically and results are applied to more complex models describing COVID-19 epidemics. Our analysis shows that, rather than the supercritical regime (infectivity larger than a critical value, [Formula: see text]) leading to new exponential growth of infection, the subcritical regime (infectivity smaller than a critical value, [Formula: see text]) with small import is able to explain the dynamic behaviour of COVID-19 spreading after a lockdown lifting, with [Formula: see text] hovering around its threshold value.

34199601	A Bioluminescent Biosensor for Quantifying the Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and Its Receptor ACE2 in Cells and In Vitro. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently spreading and mutating with increasing speed worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a simple, sensitive, and high-throughput (HTP) assay to quantify virus-host interactions in order to quickly evaluate the infectious ability of mutant viruses and to develop or validate virus-inhibiting drugs. Here, we developed an ultrasensitive bioluminescent biosensor to evaluate virus-cell interactions by quantifying the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) both in living cells and in vitro. We have successfully used this novel biosensor to analyze SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants and evaluated candidate small molecules (SMs), antibodies, and peptides that may block RBD:ACE2 interaction. This simple, rapid, and HTP biosensor tool will significantly expedite the detection of viral mutants and the anti-COVID-19 drug discovery process.	Mechanism;Treatment;Diagnosis
34373739	Obesity and severe coronavirus disease 2019: molecular mechanisms, paths forward, and therapeutic opportunities. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) appears to have higher pathogenicity among patients with obesity. Obesity, termed as body mass index greater than 30 kg/m(2), has now been demonstrated to be important comorbidity for disease severity during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated with adverse events. Unraveling mechanisms behind this phenomenon can assist scientists, clinicians, and policymakers in responding appropriately to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we systemically delineated the potential mechanistic links between obesity and worsening COVID-19 from altered physiology, underlying diseases, metabolism, immunity, cytokine storm, and thrombosis. Problematic ventilation caused by obesity and preexisting medical disorders exacerbate organ dysfunction for patients with obesity. Chronic metabolic disorders, including dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, vitamin D deficiency, and polymorphisms of metabolism-related genes in obesity, probably aid SARS-CoV-2 intrusion and impair antiviral responses. Obesity-induced inadequate antiviral immunity (interferon, natural killer cells, invariant natural killer T cell, dendritic cell, T cells, B cell) at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to delayed viral elimination, increased viral load, and expedited viral mutation. Cytokine storm, with the defective antiviral immunity, probably contributes to tissue damage and pathological progression, resulting in severe symptoms and poor prognosis. The prothrombotic state, driven in large part by endothelial dysfunction, platelet hyperactivation, hypercoagulability, and impaired fibrinolysis in obesity, also increases the risk of severe COVID-19. These mechanisms in the susceptibility to severe condition also open the possibility for host-directed therapies in population with obesity. By bridging work done in these fields, researchers can gain a holistic view of the paths forward and therapeutic opportunities to break the vicious cycle of obesity and its devastating complications in the next emerging pandemic.

34373796	Diagnostic Challenges of Pneumocystis Pneumonia during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case of a Young Patient with Ground Glass Opacities and Pulmonary Embolism on Chest CT. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is wreaking havoc across the globe. This pandemic has given rise to a mindset where physicians tend to neglect other causes of pneumonia, especially if the patient presents with signs and symptoms commonly associated with COVID-19. Herein, we report a case of a young man presenting to the emergency department with common clinical, radiological, and laboratory features of COVID-19 pneumonia such as shortness of breath, hypoxia, pulmonary embolism, elevated D-dimer, and bilateral ground glass opacities on computed tomography of the chest but was later diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia that was treated with appropriate antibiotics and corticosteroids. This case highlights the importance of performing a thorough clinical history and differentiating the clinical and radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia from pneumonia of other etiologies.

34226889	Repurposing proteases: An in-silico analysis of the binding potential of extracellular fungal proteases with selected viral proteins. Proteases have long been the target of many drugs, but their potential as therapeutic agents is a well-known, but under-explored area. Due to the heightened threat from new and emerging infectious agents, it is worthwhile to tap into the vast microbial protease resource to identify potential therapeutics. By docking proteases of the fungus Penicillium janthinellum NCIM 1366 with the proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the enzymes that have the potential to bind with, and thereby degrade viral proteins were identified. In-silico docking analysis revealed that both fungal and commercially available proteases belonging to the A1A, M20A, S10, S8A and T1A families were able to bind the viral spike, envelope, ORF-7a and Nsp2 proteins (binding energy < -50 kJ/mol), thereby opening up the possibility of developing additional therapeutic applications for these enzymes.

34204878	Follow-Up Analysis of Pulmonary Function, Exercise Capacity, Radiological Changes, and Quality of Life Two Months after Recovery from SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia. Background and objective: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 100 million people have already recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the possible outcomes of COVID-19. The aim of our study was to evaluate pulmonary function, exercise capacity, residual radiological changes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at follow-up in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia survivors. Materials and Methods: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and radiologically confirmed lung injury, with no chronic lung disease prior to this infection, were included in the study. Patients' evaluation 2 months after their discharge from hospital included spirometry (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC), determination of lung volume (TLC, VC, RV) and diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO, adjusted for hemoglobin), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), chest CT scan, and 36-Item Short Form General Health Survey (SF-36). Results: Fifty-one patients (25 men, 26 women) were included. The mean age was 56 years (SD-11,72). Eighteen patients (35.3%) had experienced moderate COVID-19, 21 (41.2%) severe COVID-19, and 12 (23.5%) were critically ill. The mean follow-up visit time after the discharge from hospital was 60 days (SD-17). Pulmonary function at follow-up was impaired in 24 (47.2%) patients. Reduced lung volume was observed in 15 (29.4%) patients, DLCO reduction in 15 (29.4%) patients, and only one patient displayed obstruction. Twelve patients out of 51 (12/51, 27.3%) showed reduced physical capacity in the 6 MWT, and 3/51 (9.1%) showed desaturation, with SO2 < 90%. Different levels of abnormality were found in 49/51 (96,1%) patients on follow-up chest CT; the median radiological score was 10.9 (SD +/- 8.87, possible maximal score, 25). Ground-glass opacity was the most common radiological feature, found in 45 (88.2%) patients. The SF-36 scores demonstrated a reduction in health status across all domains, with the lowest scores for limitations in social activities because of physical problems, vitality, and general health. Conclusion: In the group of COVID-19 pneumonia survivors 2 months after hospital discharge, residual changes in the lungs on chest CT and in lung function and reduced physical and HRQoL status were found in a significant number of patients. To evaluate COVID-19 long-term consequences, a longer follow-up period is needed.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34206468	Convalescent Plasma for Pregnant Women with COVID-19: A Systematic Literature Review. The treatment of COVID-19 is particularly critical in pregnant women, considering the potential teratogenic effects of antiviral agents and the immune-depression related with pregnancy. The aim of this review is to systematically examine the current evidence on the clinical use of convalescent plasma during pregnancy. The electronic databases Medline PubMed Advanced Search Builder, Scopus, Web Of Science and Google Scholar were searched (until 1 January 2021). Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2 infection), in whom convalescent plasma (or hyperimmune plasma) was used as treatment. We searched clinical trial registries (censored 5 January 2021) for eligible studies under way. After elimination of duplications, the initial search yielded 79 potentially relevant records, of which 67 were subsequently excluded. The 12 remaining records were case reports involving 12 pregnancies. Six of the mothers were reported to be well, two were reported to have preeclampsia, and in one case each the maternal outcome was described as survival, clinical improvement, discharged with oxygen and rehabilitation. With regard to the neonates, two were declared to be well, four had transient morbidity, two were critically ill and one died; normal ongoing pregnancies, but no post-delivery information, were reported for the remaining three cases. Clinical trials under way or planned to investigate the use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 during pregnancy are lacking. This is the first systematic review of the literature regarding the treatment of COVID-19 in pregnancy. The published literature data seem to indicate that convalescent plasma administered to pregnant women with severe COVID-19 provides benefits for both the mother and the fetus. The quality of the available studies is, however, very limited since they are all case reports and thus suffer from relevant reporting bias.	Treatment
34285462	Corneal Donation: Current Guidelines and Future Direction. Purpose: This review aims to outline current practices and guidelines of corneal donation and eye banking, describes the implications of COVID-19 and emerging diseases on the corneal donor pool, and discusses future trends to improve and increase the efficiency of the processes involved in corneal donation and eye banking. Summary: Corneal screening, preservation, corneal storage, and prevention of systemic disease transmission from donor to recipient have been crucial in shaping the policies of the FDA and eye banks across the world. Eye banks globally have developed varying guidelines and criteria for evaluating the viability of donor corneas. Variables such as the age of the donor, medical history, and potential disease transmission are important screening parameters. While known infectious diseases may be transmissible through the cornea, emerging infectious diseases that are not well studied may be more transmissible than other infections. In particular, coronavirus has impacted corneal transplantation as SARS-CoV-2 expression has been detected in corneal tissue and conjunctiva. In recent years, partial-thickness corneal transplantations have been introduced. Lamellar grafts and other corneal layers are now utilized for transplantation of the specific areas that are damaged.

34210567	The COVID-19 pandemic and opioid use disorder: Expanding treatment with buprenorphine, and combining safety precautions with telehealth. BACKGROUND: This study investigated the efficacy and safety of providing medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and individualized telehealth in Kentucky, a state severely impacted simultaneously by the opioid epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The investigation analyzed pre- and post-COVID-19 characteristics in 191 opioid use disorder (OUD) buprenorphine outpatients who completed an 18-question survey in late 2020 related to COVID testing, OUD relapses, obstacles to maintaining abstinence, and treatment resources. RESULTS: The study revealed no statistically significant changes in drug use before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic despite monthly volume increases. Results further demonstrated statistically significant barriers to treatment, including loss of housing and transportation, food insecurity, and onset of depression. No patients required hospitalization or succumbed to OUD or COVID-19. Potentially effective resource utilization findings included clinic transportation and 24/7 crisis intervention. Respondents rated telehealth as helpful when used in an individualized hybrid model matching patient's need to available resources based on COVID-19 safety guidelines. CONCLUSION: This report yields key clinical insights into providing outpatient MOUD care during the COVID-19 pandemic, validating in-person care as both safe and effective. Patients' experiences proved helpful in identifying and quantifying obstacles to abstinence in conjunction with facilitating continued patient access to essential clinical resources. Notably, telehealth can supplement rather than replace in-person treatment.	Prevention
34288409	COVID-19 vaccines: what do we know so far? When the novel coronavirus was described in late 2019, it could not have been imagined that within a year, more than 100 vaccine candidates would be in preclinical development and several would be in clinical trials and even approved for use. The scale of the COVID-19 outbreak pushed the scientific community, working in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, public health bodies, policymakers, funders and governments, to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 at record-breaking speed. As well as driving major amendments to the usual timeframe for bringing a vaccine to fruition, the pandemic has accelerated the development of next-generation technologies for vaccinology, giving rise to two frontrunner RNA vaccines. Although none of the critical safety and efficacy steps have been skipped within the compressed schedules, and the technologies underpinning the novel vaccines have been refined by scientists over many years, a significant proportion of the global population is sceptical of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines and wary of potential risks. In this interview-based article, we give an overview of how the vaccines were developed and how they work to generate a robust immune response against COVID-19, as well as addressing common questions relating to safety and efficacy.

34225276	COVID-19 Level-Loading: Transferring Emergency Department Patients to a Partner Academic Medical Center Within a Healthcare System. COVID-19 continues to challenge bed capacity and the ability of hospitals to provide quality care for patients around the country. However, the COVID-19 pandemic at a given point in time does not impact all hospitals equally-even within a single healthcare system, one hospital may be caring for patients in the hallways, while another has available inpatient beds. Here, we demonstrate a program to level-load COVID-19 patients between 2 academic medical centers in a healthcare system by transferring patients at the time of admission from the emergency department of one institution directly to an inpatient bed of the other institution. Over 42 days, 50 patients were transferred which saved 432 bed-days at the home academic medical center without any adverse events during transfer or upgrades to the ICU within the first 24 hours of admission. Programs like this can expand a healthcare system's ability to allocate personnel and resources efficiently for patients and maximize the quality of care delivered even during a pandemic.	Prevention
34281984	COVID-19 in liver transplant candidates: pretransplant and post-transplant outcomes - an ELITA/ELTR multicentre cohort study. OBJECTIVE: Explore the impact of COVID-19 on patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation (LT) and on their post-LT course. DESIGN: Data from consecutive adult LT candidates with COVID-19 were collected across Europe in a dedicated registry and were analysed. RESULTS: From 21 February to 20 November 2020, 136 adult cases with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 33 centres in 11 European countries were collected, with 113 having COVID-19. Thirty-seven (37/113, 32.7%) patients died after a median of 18 (10-30) days, with respiratory failure being the major cause (33/37, 89.2%). The 60-day mortality risk did not significantly change between first (35.3%, 95% CI 23.9% to 50.0%) and second (26.0%, 95% CI 16.2% to 40.2%) waves. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed Laboratory Model for End-stage Liver Disease (Lab-MELD) score of >/=15 (Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score 15-19, HR 5.46, 95% CI 1.81 to 16.50; MELD score>/=20, HR 5.24, 95% CI 1.77 to 15.55) and dyspnoea on presentation (HR 3.89, 95% CI 2.02 to 7.51) being the two negative independent factors for mortality. Twenty-six patients underwent an LT after a median time of 78.5 (IQR 44-102) days, and 25 (96%) were alive after a median follow-up of 118 days (IQR 31-170). CONCLUSIONS: Increased mortality in LT candidates with COVID-19 (32.7%), reaching 45% in those with decompensated cirrhosis (DC) and Lab-MELD score of >/=15, was observed, with no significant difference between first and second waves of the pandemic. Respiratory failure was the major cause of death. The dismal prognosis of patients with DC supports the adoption of strict preventative measures and the urgent testing of vaccination efficacy in this population. Prior SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection did not affect early post-transplant survival (96%).	Diagnosis;Treatment
34200951	SARS-CoV-2 Genetic Variability and Non-Specific Immunity Associated with the Use of Different BCG Strains-A Molecular and Clinical Approach. The effect of BCG vaccination against tuberculosis on the reduction in COVID-19 infection is related to the effect of the BCG vaccine on the immunomodulation of non-specific immunity. In the early stages of the pandemic, countries with universal BCG vaccination programs registered a low number of new cases of COVID-19, with the situation now reversed, as exemplified by India. The high genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2, a known characteristic of RNA viruses, causing the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 variants may have led to the virus adapting to overcome the initial immune protection. The strains from the United Kingdom (B1.1.7), Brazil (B1.1.28 and B1.1.33), South Africa (B.1.351), and India (B.1.617) are characterized by a greater ability to spread in the environment, in comparison with the original infectious agent of SARS-CoV-2. It should be remembered that the large variation in the genetic makeup of SARS-CoV-2 may result in future changes in its pathogenicity, immunogenicity and antigenicity, and therefore it is necessary to carefully study the mutations occurring within the virus to determine whether the current vaccines will remain effective. However, most studies show that monoclonal antibodies produced after vaccination against COVID-19 are effective against the newly developed variants.	Mechanism;Treatment
34210737	Reopening Italy's schools in September 2020: a Bayesian estimation of the change in the growth rate of new SARS-CoV-2 cases. OBJECTIVES: COVID-19's second wave started a debate on the potential role of schools as a primary factor in the contagion resurgence. Two opposite positions appeared: those convinced that schools played a major role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 infections and those who were not. We studied the growth rate of the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in all the Italian regions, before and after the school reopening (September-October 2020), investigating the hypothesis of an association between schools and the resurgence of the virus. METHODS: Using a Bayesian piecewise linear regression to scrutinise the number of daily SARS-CoV-2 infections in each region, we looked for an estimate of a changepoint in the growth rate of those confirmed cases. We compared the changepoints with the school opening dates, for each Italian region. The regression allows to discuss the change in steepness of the infection curve, before and after the changepoint. RESULTS: In 15 out of 21 Italian regions (71%), an estimated change in the rate of growth of the total number of daily SARS-CoV-2 infection cases occurred after an average of 16.66 days (95% CI 14.47 to 18.73) since the school reopening. The number of days required for the SARS-CoV-2 daily cases to double went from an average of 47.50 days (95% CI 37.18 to 57.61) before the changepoint to an average of 7.72 days (95% CI 7.00 to 8.48) after it. CONCLUSION: Studying the rate of growth of daily SARS-CoV-2 cases in all the regions provides some evidence in favour of a link between school reopening and the resurgence of the virus. The number of factors that could have played a role is too many to give a definitive answer. Still, the temporal correspondence warrants further systematic experiments to investigate on potential confounders that could clarify how much reopening schools mattered.	Prevention
34222736	The effect of COVID-19 in a newly established burn center. Objective: This study aims to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on epidemiological features, burn agent, burn percentage, and hospitalization time in a burn center. Methods: This single-center, retrospective study included a total of 401 patients admitted to our study center between October 2019 and July 2020. The patients who were admitted before March 1, 2020, were considered the pre-March group, and those who were admitted after March 1, 2020, were considered the post-March group. According to their age, the patients were further divided into groups as those aged </= 18 years and those aged > 18 years. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients, burn agent, burn surface area, COVID-19 status, and treatment and follow-up data were recorded. Results: Our study results showed no significant difference in the number of patient admission, age, and sex of patients, burn agents and length of hospital stay before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusions: Burn centers can work safely in COVID-19 outbreak, paying special attention to precautions mandated by the national and global health authorities. However, the increase in pandemic burden may force the burn centers to be converted into alternate COVID-19 facilities. In such cases, the care of burn patients may pose a great problem.	Prevention
34217411	Prioritizing cervical cancer screening services during the COVID-19 pandemic: Response of an academic medical center and a public safety net hospital in California. The expeditious diagnosis and treatment of high-grade cervical precancers are fundamental to cervical cancer prevention. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic healthcare systems have at times restricted in-person visits to those deemed urgent. Professional societies provided some guidance to clinicians regarding ways in which traditional cervical cancer screening might be modified, but many gaps remained. To address these gaps, leaders of screening programs at an academic medical center and an urban safety net hospital in California formed a rapid-action committee to provide guidance to its practitioners. Patients were divided into 6 categories corresponding to various stages in the screening process and ranked by risk of underlying high-grade cervical precancer and cancer. Tiers corresponding to the intensity of the local pandemic were constructed, and clinical delays were lengthened for the lowest-risk patients as tiers escalated. The final product was a management grid designed to escalate and de-escalate with changes in the local epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic. While this effort resulted in substantial delays in clinical screening services as mandated by the healthcare systems, the population effects of delaying on both cervical cancer outcomes as well as the beneficial effects related to decreasing transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 have yet to be elucidated.

34209087	Evaluation of Strategies to Fight COVID-19: The French Paradigm. (1) Background: We collected COVID-19 mortality data and the age distribution of the deceased in France and other European countries, as well as specifically in the cities of Paris and Marseille, and compared them. (2) Methods: Data on mortality related to COVID-19 and the associated age distribution were collected from government institutions in various European countries. In France, data were obtained from INSEE and Sante Publique France. All-cause mortality was also examined in order to study potential excess mortality using EuroMOMO. The Marseille data came from the epidemiological surveillance system. (3) Results: France is one of the European countries most impacted by COVID-19. Its proportion of deaths in people under 60 years of age is higher (6.5%) than that of Italy (4.6%) or Spain (4.7%). Excess mortality (5% more deaths) was also observed. Ile-de-France and the Grand-Est are the two French regions with the highest mortality. The proportion of deaths in the under-60 age group was considerable in Ile-de-France (9.9% vs. 4.5% in the Southern region). There are significantly higher numbers of patients hospitalized, in intensive care and deceased in Paris than in Marseille. (4) Conclusions: No patient management, i.e., from screening to diagnosis, including biological assessment and clinical examination, likely explains the high mortality associated with COVID-19.

34226649	A unifying nonlinear probabilistic epidemic model in space and time. Covid-19 epidemic dramatically relaunched the importance of mathematical modelling in supporting governments decisions to slow down the disease propagation. On the other hand, it remains a challenging task for mathematical modelling. The interplay between different models could be a key element in the modelling strategies. Here we propose a continuous space-time non-linear probabilistic model from which we can derive many of the existing models both deterministic and stochastic as for example SI, SIR, SIR stochastic, continuous-time stochastic models, discrete stochastic models, Fisher-Kolmogorov model. A partial analogy with the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics provides an interpretation of the model. Epidemic forecasting is one of its possible applications; in principle, the model can be used in order to locate those regions of space where the infection probability is going to increase. The connection between non-linear probabilistic and non-linear deterministic models is analyzed. In particular, it is shown that the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation is connected to linear probabilistic models. On the other hand, a generalized version of the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation is derived from the non-linear probabilistic model and is shown to be characterized by a non-homogeneous time-dependent diffusion coefficient (anomalous diffusion) which encodes information about the non-linearity of the probabilistic model.

34219793	Intelligent anti-epidemic mask based on KF and ECF fusion algorithm. In response to environmental pollution and the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), this paper proposes a new type of smart mask design, and specifically proposes an optimized double closed-loop control method, especially an improved filtering fusion algorithm. Using the filtering fusion algorithm proposed in this paper, after the Kalman filter (KF) filters the raw data of the attitude sensor, explicit complementary filtering and data fusion are used to obtain the attitude angle of the body. At the same time, the obtained attitude angle is combined with acceleration and blood oxygen concentration to obtain the behaviour characteristic value. On this basis, the speed of the oxygen supply fan captured by the photoelectric sensor is used to form a closed loop with the characteristic value of the behaviour. Finally, the structure of the mask is upgraded and optimized through fluid mechanics simulation, and experiments have verified that the combination of the replaceable filter cloth, the intelligent control system and the ultraviolet disinfection device can effectively protect people's health.

34214339	Phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin, the isolated compounds of Phyllanthus niruri inhibit protein receptor of corona virus (COVID-19) through in silico approach. OBJECTIVES: Phyllanthus niruri has been known as an immunomodulator and also reported to possess an antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, such as hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus by inhibiting viral entry and replication. Since the current situation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) which infected among the world and caused severe disease and high morbidity, it urgently needed to find new agents against COVID-19. Therefore, in silico screening against COVID-19 receptors is carried out as an initial stage of drug discovery by evaluating the activity of phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin, an isolated from Phyllanthus niruri, in inhibiting spike glycoprotein (6LZG) and main protease (5R7Y) which play as target receptors of COVID-19. METHODS: Molegro Virtual Docker 6.0 used to determine the best binding energy through the rerank score which shows the total energy bonds calculation. RESULTS: Phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin demonstrated to possess greater binding affinity toward the COVID-19 inhibition sites than their native ligand. The rerank score of phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin are lower than the native ligands 6LZG and 5R7Y. This result indicated that phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin have a stronger interaction than the native ligands both in spike glycoprotein (entry inhibitor) and main protease (translation and replication inhibitor). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin are predicted to have strong activity against COVID-19 through inhibiting spike glycoprotein and main protease under in silico study. Further research is needed to support the development of P. niruri as inhibitor agents of COVID-19 through bioassay studies.	Mechanism;Treatment
34202578	Effects of a 2-Week 5000 IU versus 1000 IU Vitamin D3 Supplementation on Recovery of Symptoms in Patients with Mild to Moderate Covid-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial. OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 severity. This multi-center randomized clinical trial aims to determine the effects of 5000 IU versus 1000 IU daily oral vitamin D3 supplementation in the recovery of symptoms and other clinical parameters among mild to moderate COVID-19 patients with sub-optimal vitamin D status. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A total of 69 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 positive adults who were hospitalized for mild to moderate COVID-19 disease were allocated to receive once daily for 2 weeks either 5000 IU oral vitamin D3 (n = 36, 21 males; 15 females) or 1000 IU oral vitamin D3 (standard control) (n = 33, 13 males; 20 females). Anthropometrics were measured and blood samples were taken pre- and post-supplementation. Fasting blood glucose, lipids, serum 25(OH)D, and inflammatory markers were measured. COVID-19 symptoms were noted on admission and monitored until full recovery. RESULTS: Vitamin D supplementation for 2 weeks caused a significant increase in serum 25(OH)D levels in the 5000 IU group only (adjusted p = 0.003). Within-group comparisons also showed a significant decrease in BMI and IL-6 levels overtime in both groups (p-values < 0.05) but was not clinically significant in between-group comparisons. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the 5000 IU group had a significantly shorter time to recovery (days) than the 1000 IU group in resolving cough, even after adjusting for age, sex, baseline BMI, and D-dimer (6.2 +/- 0.8 versus 9.1 +/- 0.8; p = 0.039), and ageusia (loss of taste) (11.4 +/- 1.0 versus 16.9 +/- 1.7; p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: A 5000 IU daily oral vitamin D3 supplementation for 2 weeks reduces the time to recovery for cough and gustatory sensory loss among patients with sub-optimal vitamin D status and mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. The use of 5000 IU vitamin D3 as an adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 patients with suboptimal vitamin D status, even for a short duration, is recommended.	Treatment;Diagnosis
34289146	Erythema nodosum-like eruption in coronavirus disease 2019: A case report and literature review of Asian countries. In the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, skin manifestations were seen in COVID-19 patients. We report a case in which a COVID-19 patient developed cutaneous lesions that were diagnosed as erythema nodosum-like lesions, which were associated with COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Histopathologically, extensive inflammation was seen from the epidermis to the fat tissue. An organized thrombus and disrupted inner elastic lamina were seen in an intradermal vessel. These findings suggest septal panniculitis with cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. The results of PCR using the specimen of skin lesion was negative. The patient took non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the skin lesion improved in 3 weeks. To characterize the skin eruption, we reviewed previous reports on COVID-19 (confirmed by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection) from Asian countries. The type of eruption and timing of its appearance in this case seemed rare. Differences in skin manifestations between Western and Asian countries were noted.	Case Report
34377609	A Rare Case of Herpes Zoster in an Adult Patient Recovered From Symptomatic Reinfection of COVID-19. In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, various dermatological conditions have been observed. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus must be ruled out before considering vesicular exanthems linked to COVID-19. The immunological status of the host has an impact on the natural history of herpes zoster (HZ). Age is a major risk factor for most of the cases of HZ. Reactivation of VZV can be triggered by iatrogenic immunosuppression or disease-related immunocompromised state or age-related immunosenescence. Rarely, dermatological symptoms have been reported in recovered COVID-19 patients. We hereby present a rare case of HZ in a recovered patient from symptomatic reinfection of COVID-19.	Case Report
34344739	Development of a framework of intervention strategies for point of care quality improvement at different levels of healthcare delivery system in India: initial lessons. BACKGROUND: Inadequate quality of care has been identified as one of the most significant challenges to achieving universal health coverage in low-income and middle-income countries. To address this WHO-SEARO, the point of care quality improvement (POCQI) method has been developed. This paper describes developing a dynamic framework for the implementation of POCQI across India from 2015 to 2020. METHODS: A total of 10 intervention strategies were designed as per the needs of the local health settings. These strategies were implemented across 10 states of India, using a modification of the 'translating research in practice' framework. Healthcare professionals and administrators were trained in POCQI using a combination of onsite and online training methods followed by coaching and mentoring support. The implementation strategy changed to a fully digital community of practice platform during the active phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dashboard process, outcome indicators and crude cost of implementation were collected and analysed across the implementation sites. RESULTS: Three implementation frameworks were evolved over the study period. The combined population benefitting from these interventions was 103 million. A pool of QI teams from 131 facilities successfully undertook 165 QI projects supported by a pool of 240 mentors over the study period. A total of 21 QI resources and 6 publications in peer-reviewed journals were also developed. The average cost of implementing POCQI initiatives for a target population of one million was US$ 3219. A total of 100 online activities were conducted over 6 months by the digital community of practice. The framework has recently extended digitally across the South-East Asian region. CONCLUSION: The development of an implementation framework for POCQI is an essential requirement for the initiative's successful country-wide scale. The implementation plan should be flexible to the healthcare system's needs, target population and the implementing agency's capacity and amenable to multiple iterative changes.	Prevention
34209105	Self-Isolation and Quarantine during the UK's First Wave of COVID-19. A Mixed-Methods Study of Non-Adherence. Self-isolation and quarantine measures were introduced by the UK Government on 12 March 2020 as part of the 'delay' phase to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Non-adherence to self-isolation for 7 days after the development of symptoms is considered suboptimal and little is known about adherence to quarantine for 14 days if a co-habitant developed symptoms. This study aims to analyse non-adherence behaviours to self-isolation and quarantine measures by identifying their potential psycho-social and demographic predictors and by exploring people's accounts of their experiences with these measures. A mixed-methods convergent design was used, comprising an online survey (n = 681) completed by residents in six North London boroughs and qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants (n = 16). Findings identified not accessing community support, lack of control over leaving the house, and lack of perceived benefit and need to follow the rules as behaviours associated with non-adherence to quarantine (42.7%). Non-adherence to self-isolating measures (24.4%) was associated with individuals' perceived lack of control over responsibilities, lack of control over leaving the house, uncertainty about symptoms experienced, lack of access to tests, and distrust in the Government. Adherence to self-isolation and quarantine could be improved through strengthening perceived benefit to self-isolate with messages emphasising its effectiveness, by implementing a two-way information system to support symptoms identification, and with Government-funded, locally supported packages at different levels (financial, food, and practical needs).

34219929	COVID-19 infection and severe rhabdomyolysis. Although patients with COVID-19 can have mild nonspecific myalgia and mild elevation of creatinine kinase levels, severe myalgia along with elevation of creatinine kinase levels >10 times the upper normal limit and dark-colored urine indicate an underlying severe rhabdomyolysis. This report describes a 60-year-old morbidly obese man who was found to have severe rhabdomyolysis, along with acute kidney injury, dark-colored urine, and a positive COVID-19 test. He had a prolonged hospital course requiring continuous renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation, and multiple vasopressors and eventually died of multiorgan failure. The management of severe rhabdomyolysis and COVID-19 is challenging, and fluid resuscitation should be done cautiously, monitoring for early signs of fluid overload.	Case Report
34226833	COVID-19 and the UK water sector: Exploring organizational responses through a resilience framework. The unprecedented scale and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have required organizations to adapt all facets of their operations. The impact on the UK water sector extends beyond engineering and treatment processes, with social, economic and environmental consequences. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with executives from 10 UK water companies to investigate the organizational response to the pandemic, and how their response impacted operational delivery. The Safe and SuRe framework was used to structure interview questions and analysis. Emergent themes of changes to customer behaviour, changes to operational practices and industry collaboration were mapped onto the framework and a ripple effect map developed. Lessons learnt highlight a failure to adequately prepare for the scale of the threat, the success of sector-level collaboration and a need to embrace new ways of working.	Prevention
34292599	Lethal ageism in the shadow of pandemic response tactics. AIM: This paper examines aspects of pandemic policy responses to the COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 variants and presents an integrated view of the consequences of response tactics at national and health service levels for older adults. BACKGROUND: Nurses are positioned at the intersection of health service and policy implementation; therefore, their influence on clinical protocols and health policy directions post pandemic is crucial to preventing further premature deaths in the 65+ years age group and others. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE: Perspectives presented here are based on a critical evaluation of the many published reports, comments, research and insights concerning the pandemic. That evidence, combined with my experience in various fields of study and professional service, enables me to envisage what some decisions and policies may mean for older people, nurses and societies worldwide. DISCUSSION: Established information on world population patterns and the location and health of national groups has been made less reliable by population shifts caused by years of geo-political conflicts and now the impact of the pandemic. Added to this already chaotic context, the pandemic has further disrupted societies, health services and economies. Ageist responses by these systems have further disadvantaged older people and generated trust deficits that need to be resolved. CONCLUSION: When the pandemic recedes, policy and management decisions taken by governments and hospital administrators will be a telling indicator of whether the established systematic ageism exposed during the pandemic will continue to compromise the health and longevity of older adults. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING, HEALTH AND SOCIAL POLICY: The ascendency of nursing influence within the health and social policy environment must be further strengthened to enable nurses to champion equity and fairness in the pandemic recovery effort.

34218535	Impact of cancelled General Anaesthetic dental extraction appointments on children due to the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has resulted in the cancellation of general anaesthetic procedures including dental extractions (GAX) for children in the UK, exacerbating existing inequalities. There is robust evidence that children from deprived and some ethnic backgrounds are at greater risk of caries and are, therefore, more likely to be affected by cancellations. AIM: To identify the impact of, and possible mitigations for, cancelled general anaesthetic procedures on children in the South East of England. DESIGN: Data were collected from service providers on the number of children who had their appointments cancelled during the first lockdown. Paediatric dentists and clinical leads contributed views on the likely impact of these cancellations on the affected children. RESULTS: 1,456 children had their appointments cancelled in the six weeks between 20th March and 30th June 2020. The key themes identified from providers included lengthening waiting lists, challenges of swab testing and self-isolation and the need to re-orientate dental services to increase prevention. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has exacerbated existing health inequalities within our communities. Different parts of the NHS must work together to ensure that all children have access to services to treat and improve oral health.	Prevention
34374745	COVID-19 in Workplaces: Secondary Transmission. OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) contagion at work is well studied for healthcare workers, however it is not enough assessed in other working settings. Very little is known, indeed, about the risk of COVID-19 transmission through occupational exposure in non-health working places. This study aims to describe a COVID-19 cluster among workers in an office in Italy. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study on a cluster of COVID-19 that occurred from 20 November through 3 December 2020 in a group of six colleagues (A-F) working in the same office full time 5 days a week, 8 h a day. The workers used the following prevention measures: social distancing (desks were >1 m, 1.76-5.01 m range), plexiglas panels, hands disinfection, and use of face mask. However, they did not wear face mask when in static position sitting at their desk and they did not aerate the place frequently. RESULTS: The disease spread from one worker (subject A) to four (80%) of the five colleagues (subjects B-F). Only subject D was negative to COVID-19 on 14 days after last contact with subject A (20 November 2020) as confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab testing. Subject D, in particular, did not contact subject A in the 48 h before symptoms onset. COVID-19 positivity of subject A was promptly communicated to the colleagues, who started self-isolation from their relatives and none of their households were infected. COVID-19 transmission was observed only in households of subject A. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid communication of COVID-19 positivity to the colleagues and the prompt isolation of index case's close contacts allowed to eliminate the secondary transmission to their households. The contagion of index case's colleagues occurred from second day before symptoms onset. Distancing of >1 m, use of plexiglass panels, sanitizing hand gel, and inconstant use of face mask may not be enough for infection prevention in closed places with poor ventilation and high occupancy.

34287907	Association of Severe Tongue Edema With Prone Positioning in Patients Intubated for COVID-19. OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Prone positioning is frequently used in patients intubated for COVID-19-related lung injury to improve oxygenation. At our institution, we observed severe tongue edema develop in some of these patients. Hence, we sought to determine the incidence of tongue edema in this cohort and whether prone positioning was a risk factor associated with this complication. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: A single-system retrospective cohort study of patients intubated for respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 who subsequently developed clinically notable tongue edema from March 13 to July 5, 2020. RESULTS: 260 patients were intubated for COVID-19-related respiratory failure during the study period. 158 patients (60.8%) underwent at least one episode of proning. Twelve patients in total (4.6%) developed clinically significant tongue edema. Eleven of the twelve patients (91.7%) who developed tongue edema underwent proning prior to the development of edema. Prone positioning was associated with an increased incidence of tongue edema (odds ratio [OR] 7.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-59.46, P = .027). In all proned patients who developed edema, this complication was noted during proning or shortly after supination (range, 0-4 days). Tongue edema was primarily managed with conservative measures; one patient required tracheostomy for definitive management. CONCLUSIONS: Tongue edema appears to develop in a subset of patients with COVID-19 who are intubated. It appears to be associated with prone positioning but is likely multifactorial in nature. Further investigation into its incidence and pathophysiology is warranted. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 2021.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34284837	Optimization of man power deployment for Covid-19 screening in a tertiary care hospital: A study of utility of queuing analysis. OBJECTIVES: The recent Covid-19 pandemic has burdened the healthcare facilities, especially in the presence of limited infrastructure. We aimed at applying a queuing model to the Covid-19 screening area so as to optimize the screening services and ensuring that no patient is refused the service. METHODS: The mean arrival time of patients, number of physicians, mean screening time and queue characteristics were observed and entered in the M/M/c/K queuing model using R programming to optimize the number of physicians required in the screening area. RESULTS: Considering the mean arrival of seven patients in 10 minutes and screening of three patients in 10 minutes by one physician, two physicians were assigned. At this capacity, the probability of saturation of the system was 15% with patient loss rate of 1.05 per 10 minutes. Queuing simulation with three physicians reduced the patient loss rate to 0.013 per 10 minutes and saturation probability of 0.2%. However, an increase of arrival rate from 10 to 20 led to an early saturation of the system. CONCLUSION: Queuing models offer an opportunity for the healthcare providers and hospital administrators to optimize patient care services, especially in critical areas with an ever-changing situation such as the current pandemic.

34220684	Early Effects of Passive Leg-Raising Test, Fluid Challenge, and Norepinephrine on Cerebral Autoregulation and Oxygenation in COVID-19 Critically Ill Patients. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are at high risk of neurological complications consequent to several factors including persistent hypotension. There is a paucity of data on the effects of therapeutic interventions designed to optimize systemic hemodynamics on cerebral autoregulation (CA) in this group of patients. Methods: Single-center, observational prospective study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy, from October 1 to December 15, 2020. Mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, who had at least one episode of hypotension and received a passive leg raising (PLR) test, were included. They were then treated with fluid challenge (FC) and/or norepinephrine (NE), according to patients' clinical conditions, at different moments. The primary outcome was to assess the early effects of PLR test and of FC and NE [when clinically indicated to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP)] on CA (CA index) measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD). Secondary outcomes were to evaluate the effects of PLR test, FC, and NE on systemic hemodynamic variables, cerebral oxygenation (rSo2), and non-invasive intracranial pressure (nICP). Results: Twenty-three patients were included and underwent PLR test. Of these, 22 patients received FC and 14 were treated with NE. The median age was 62 years (interquartile range = 57-68.5 years), and 78% were male. PLR test led to a low CA index [58% (44-76.3%)]. FC and NE administration resulted in a CA index of 90.8% (74.2-100%) and 100% (100-100%), respectively. After PLR test, nICP based on pulsatility index and nICP based on flow velocity diastolic formula was increased [18.6 (17.7-19.6) vs. 19.3 (18.2-19.8) mm Hg, p = 0.009, and 12.9 (8.5-18) vs. 15 (10.5-19.7) mm Hg, p = 0.001, respectively]. PLR test, FC, and NE resulted in a significant increase in MAP and rSo2. Conclusions: In mechanically ventilated severe COVID-19 patients, PLR test adversely affects CA. An individualized strategy aimed at assessing both the hemodynamic and cerebral needs is warranted in patients at high risk of neurological complications.	Treatment
34228472	Electrostatic Interactions Explain the Higher Binding Affinity of the CR3022 Antibody for SARS-CoV-2 than the 4A8 Antibody. A structural understanding of the mechanism by which antibodies bind SARS-CoV-2 at the atomic level is highly desirable as it can tell the development of more effective antibodies to treat Covid-19. Here, we use steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and coarse-grained simulations to estimate the binding affinity of the monoclonal antibodies CR3022 and 4A8 to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and SARS-CoV-2 N-terminal domain (NTD). Consistent with experiments, our SMD and coarse-grained simulations both indicate that CR3022 has a higher affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD than 4A8 for the NTD, and the coarse-grained simulations indicate the former binds three times stronger to its respective epitope. This finding shows that CR3022 is a candidate for Covid-19 therapy and is likely a better choice than 4A8. Energetic decomposition of the interaction energies between these two complexes reveals that electrostatic interactions explain the difference in the observed binding affinity between the two complexes. This result could lead to a new approach for developing anti-Covid-19 antibodies in which good candidates must contain charged amino acids in the area of contact with the virus.	Mechanism;Treatment
34338380	Systematic review of host genetic association with Covid-19 prognosis and susceptibility: What have we learned in 2020? Biomarker identification may provide strategic opportunities to understand disease pathophysiology, predict outcomes, improve human health, and reduce healthcare costs. The highly heterogeneous Covid-19 clinical manifestation suggests a complex interaction of several different human, viral and environmental factors. Here, we systematically reviewed genetic association studies evaluating Covid-19 severity or susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection following PRISMA recommendations. Our research comprised papers published until December 31(st) , 2020, in PubMed and BioRXiv databases focusing on genetic association studies with Covid-19 prognosis or susceptibility. We found 20 eligible genetic association studies, of which 11 assessed Covid-19 outcome and 14 evaluated infection susceptibility (five analyzed both effects). Q-genie assessment indicated moderate quality. Five large-scale association studies (GWAS, whole-genome, or exome sequencing) were reported with no consistent replication to date. Promising hits were found on the 3p21.31 region and ABO locus. Candidate gene studies examined ACE1, ACE2, TMPRSS2, IFITM3, APOE, Furin, IFNL3, IFNL4, HLA, TNF-a genes, and ABO system. The most evaluated single locus was the ABO, and the most sampled region was the HLA with three and five candidate gene studies, respectively. Meta-analysis could not be performed. Available data showed the need for further reports to replicate claimed associations.	Mechanism
34292740	DIA-Based Proteome Profiling of Nasopharyngeal Swabs from COVID-19 Patients. Since the recent outbreak of COVID-19, there have been intense efforts to understand viral pathogenesis and host immune response to combat SARS-CoV-2. It has become evident that different host alterations can be identified in SARS-CoV-2 infection based on whether infected cells, animal models or clinical samples are studied. Although nasopharyngeal swabs are routinely collected for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR testing, host alterations in the nasopharynx at the proteomic level have not been systematically investigated. Thus, we sought to characterize the host response through global proteome profiling of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. A mass spectrometer combining trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) and high-resolution QTOF mass spectrometer with parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) was deployed for unbiased proteome profiling. First, deep proteome profiling of pooled nasopharyngeal swab samples was performed in the PASEF enabled DDA mode, which identified 7723 proteins that were then used to generate a spectral library. This approach provided peptide level evidence of five missing proteins for which MS/MS spectrum and mobilograms were validated with synthetic peptides. Subsequently, quantitative proteomic profiling was carried out for 90 individual nasopharyngeal swab samples (45 positive and 45 negative) in DIA combined with PASEF, termed as diaPASEF mode, which resulted in a total of 5023 protein identifications. Of these, 577 proteins were found to be upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Functional analysis of these upregulated proteins revealed alterations in several biological processes including innate immune response, viral protein assembly, and exocytosis. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to deploy diaPASEF for quantitative proteomic profiling of clinical samples and shows the feasibility of adopting such an approach to understand mechanisms and pathways altered in diseases.

34348603	C1-Inhibitor: Structure, Functional Diversity and Therapeutic Development. Human C1-Inhibitor (C1INH), also known as C1-esterase inhibitor, is an important multifunctional plasma glycoprotein that is uniquely involved in a regulatory network of complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems. C1INH belongs to a superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitor (serpins) and exhibits its inhibitory activities towards several target proteases of plasmatic cascades, operating as a major anti-inflammatory protein in the circulation. In addition to its inhibitory activities, C1INH is also involved in non-inhibitory interactions with some endogenous proteins, polyanions, cells and infectious agents. While C1INH is essential for multiple physiological processes, it is better known for its deficiency with regards to Hereditary Angioedema (HAE), a rare autosomal dominant disease clinically manifested by recurrent acute attacks of increased vascular permeability and edema. Since the link was first established between functional C1INH deficiency in plasma and HAE in the 1960s, tremendous progress has been made in the biochemical characterization of C1INH and its therapeutic development for replacement therapies in patients with C1INH-dependent HAE. Various C1INH biological activities, recent advances in the HAE-targeted therapies, and availability of C1INH commercial products have prompted intensive investigation of the C1INH potential for treatment of clinical conditions other than HAE. This article provides an updated overview of the structure and biological activities of C1INH, its role in HAE pathogenesis, and recent advances in the research and therapeutic development of C1INH; it also considers some trends for using C1INH therapeutic preparations for applications other than angioedema, from sepsis and endotoxin shock to severe thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients.

34350341	Changes in Care Provision During COVID-19 Impact Patient Well-Being. The fast onset and extensive impact of COVID-19 necessitated strict public health measures and temporary diversion of personnel and resources from other types of medical care. This study examined the prevalence of such disruptions and their impacts on patient-perceived well-being using an untargeted survey. The majority of surveyed patients experienced changes in their routine medical care. Of those whose appointments were postponed or canceled, most patients indicated an overall negative impact on their emotional and physical well-being. We highlighted the impact of disruptions in nonurgent medical care during a large-scale public health emergency.	Prevention
34220505	Lactoferrin Against SARS-CoV-2: In Vitro and In Silico Evidences. Lactoferrin (Lf) is a cationic glycoprotein synthetized by exocrine glands and is present in all human secretions. It is also secreted by neutrophils in infection and inflammation sites. This glycoprotein possesses antimicrobial activity due to its capability to chelate two ferric ions per molecule, as well as to interact with bacterial and viral anionic surface components. The cationic features of Lf bind to cells, protecting the host from bacterial and viral injuries. Its anti-inflammatory activity is mediated by the ability to enter inside the nucleus of host cells, thus inhibiting the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokine genes. In particular, Lf down-regulates the synthesis of IL-6, which is involved in iron homeostasis disorders and leads to intracellular iron overload, favoring viral replication and infection. The well-known antiviral activity of Lf has been demonstrated against DNA, RNA, and enveloped and naked viruses and, therefore, Lf could be efficient in counteracting also SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this purpose, we performed in vitro assays, proving that Lf exerts an antiviral activity against SARS-COV-2 through direct attachment to both SARS-CoV-2 and cell surface components. This activity varied according to concentration (100/500 mug/ml), multiplicity of infection (0.1/0.01), and cell type (Vero E6/Caco-2 cells). Interestingly, the in silico results strongly supported the hypothesis of a direct recognition between Lf and the spike S glycoprotein, which can thus hinder viral entry into the cells. These in vitro observations led us to speculate a potential supplementary role of Lf in the management of COVID-19 patients.	Mechanism;Treatment
34205487	Inflammatory Mechanisms in COVID-19 and Atherosclerosis: Current Pharmaceutical Perspectives. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with excess mortality worldwide. The cardiovascular system is the second most common target of SARS-CoV-2, which leads to severe complications, including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism, as well as other major thrombotic events because of direct endothelial injury and an excessive systemic inflammatory response. This review focuses on the similarities and the differences of inflammatory pathways involved in COVID-19 and atherosclerosis. Anti-inflammatory agents and immunomodulators have recently been assessed, which may constitute rational treatments for the reduction of cardiovascular events in both COVID-19 and atherosclerotic heart disease.

34228347	Key summary of German national treatment guidance for hospitalized COVID-19 patients Key pharmacologic recommendations from a national German living guideline using an Evidence to Decision Framework (last updated 17.05.2021). PURPOSE: This executive summary of a national living guideline aims to provide rapid evidence based recommendations on the role of drug interventions in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The guideline makes use of a systematic assessment and decision process using an evidence to decision framework (GRADE) as recommended standard WHO (2021). Recommendations are consented by an interdisciplinary panel. Evidence analysis and interpretation is supported by the CEOsys project providing extensive literature searches and living (meta-) analyses. For this executive summary, selected key recommendations on drug therapy are presented including the quality of the evidence and rationale for the level of recommendation. RESULTS: The guideline contains 11 key recommendations for COVID-19 drug therapy, eight of which are based on systematic review and/or meta-analysis, while three recommendations represent consensus expert opinion. Based on current evidence, the panel makes strong recommendations for corticosteroids (WHO scale 5-9) and prophylactic anticoagulation (all hospitalized patients with COVID-19) as standard of care. Intensified anticoagulation may be considered for patients with additional risk factors for venous thromboembolisms (VTE) and a low bleeding risk. The IL-6 antagonist tocilizumab may be added in case of high supplemental oxygen requirement and progressive disease (WHO scale 5-6). Treatment with nMABs may be considered for selected inpatients with an early SARS-CoV-2 infection that are not hospitalized for COVID-19. Convalescent plasma, azithromycin, ivermectin or vitamin D3 should not be used in COVID-19 routine care. CONCLUSION: For COVID-19 drug therapy, there are several options that are sufficiently supported by evidence. The living guidance will be updated as new evidence emerges.	Treatment
34132519	Aerosol Dynamics Model for Estimating the Risk from Short-Range Airborne Transmission and Inhalation of Expiratory Droplets of SARS-CoV-2. The highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus has resulted in a global pandemic. More than a hundred million people are already impacted, with infected numbers expected to go up. Coughing, sneezing, and even talking emit respiratory droplets which can carry infectious viruses. It is important to understand how the exhaled particles move through air to an exposed person to better predict the airborne transmission impacts of SARS-CoV-2. There are many studies conducted on the airborne spread of viruses causing diseases such as SARS and measles; however, there are very limited studies that couple the transport characteristics with the aerosol dynamics of the droplets. In this study, a comprehensive model for simultaneous droplet evaporation and transport due to diffusion, convection, and gravitational settling is developed to determine the near spatial and temporal concentration of the viable virus exhaled by the infected individual. The exposure to the viable virus is estimated by calculating the respiratory deposition, and the risk of infection is determined using a dose-response model. The developed model is used to quantify the risk of short-range airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from inhalation of virus-laden droplets when an infected individual is directly in front of the person exposed and the surrounding air is stagnant. The effect of different parameters, such as viral load, infectivity factor, emission sources, physical separation, exposure time, ambient air velocity, dilution, and mask usage, is determined on the risk of exposure.

34349324	Perioperative Obstetric Care in Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019: Anesthetic Perspective. Background: The novel coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic involving many countries and has affected more than seventy-nine million people worldwide, with greater than a million deaths in the current scenario. Aims: The aim of the study is to improvise perioperative obstetric healthcare in a tertiary healthcare center. Settings and Design: This is a retrospective case series of parturients infected with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: We present a case series of COVID-19-infected parturients. There is no evidence that pregnant women are more likely to become seriously affected by coronavirus, yet these groups of patients are vulnerable to infection. Hence, the objectives in the management of such patients which includes caring for the range of the asymptomatic to critically ill women in the peripartum period and protection of healthcare providers from exposure to the disease while treating them while treating them is of paramount importance. Results: There is limited literature available about the effect of this disease and the risk of complications in pregnancy. The variables affect the respiratory system and exacerbate the susceptibility to infections. This complicates or delays the diagnosis in COVID-19-infected parturients, which affect their clinical outcome. Thus, there is a need on focused and optimal management in a tertiary healthcare center. Of the total 109 lower segment cesarean section patients in our hospital, there were only two maternal and neonatal deaths among the 12 emergency cases performed. Conclusions: Collaborative efforts are imperative among experts such as anesthesiologists and obstetricians to tackle the impact of this disease. There must be surveillance systems in place for reporting maternal and fetal data during this pandemic.	Case Report
34199893	Healthcare Professionals Promotion of Physical Activity with Older Adults: A Survey of Knowledge and Routine Practice. Healthcare professionals have a key role in promoting physical activity, particularly among populations at greatest risk of poor health due to physical inactivity. This research aimed to develop our understanding of healthcare professionals knowledge, decision making and routine practice of physical activity promotion with older adults. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with practicing healthcare professionals in general practice, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and nursing in Ireland and Northern Ireland. We received 347 eligible responses, with 70.3% of all respondents agreeing that discussing physical activity is their job and 30.0% agreeing that they have received suitable training to initiate conversations with patients about physical activity. Awareness of the content and objectives of national guidelines for physical activity varied considerably across the health professions surveyed. Less than a third of respondents had a clear plan on how to initiate discussions about physical activity in routine practice with older adults. Assessment of physical activity was not routine, neither was signposting to physical activity supports. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications, 81.6% of all respondents agreed that healthcare professionals can play an increased role in promoting physical activity to older adults as part of routine practice. Appropriate education, training and access to resources are essential for supporting healthcare professionals promotion of physical activity in routine practice. Effective physical activity promotion in healthcare settings has the potential for health benefits at a population level, particularly in older adult populations.	Prevention
34200823	Adherence to Immunosuppression Medications among Heart Transplant Recipients: Challenges, Opportunities, and Potential Role of Digital Approaches in the COVID-19 Era. Society and medical practice have been restructured dramatically to avoid further spread of the COVID-19 virus; telehealth/telemedicine, mask wearing, and nationwide social distancing practices have become widespread. However, we still face unprecedented challenges in fields where patients require frequent and active follow-up visits for monitoring, including that of solid-organ transplant, and in particular, heart transplant. Adherence to immunosuppression remains a unique challenge in heart transplantation, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Failure to adhere to immunosuppression can have disastrous consequences, including graft rejection and death. In this article, we discuss challenges related to adherence to immunosuppression medications among heart transplant recipients, as well as opportunities to leverage digital approaches and interventions to monitor and optimize adherence behavior and health outcomes in this population.

34378474	Insights into the modulation of the interferon response and NAD(+) in the context of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in dramatic worldwide mortality. Along with developing vaccines, the medical profession is exploring new strategies to curb this pandemic. A better understanding of the molecular consequences of SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection could lead to more effective and safer treatments. This review discusses the potential underlying impact of SARS-CoV-2 in modulating interferon (IFN) secretion and in causing mitochondrial NAD(+) depletion that could be directly linked to COVID-19's deadly manifestations. What is known or surmised about an imbalanced innate immune response and mitochondrial dysfunction post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the potential benefits of well-timed IFN treatments and NAD(+) boosting therapies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.

34223911	Host factors facilitating SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and replication in the lungs. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus causing the major pandemic facing the world today. Although, SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes lung infection, a variety of symptoms have proven a systemic impact on the body. SARS-CoV-2 has spread in the community quickly infecting humans from all age, ethnicities and gender. However, fatal outcomes have been linked to specific host factors and co-morbidities such as age, hypertension, immuno-deficiencies, chronic lung diseases or metabolic disorders. A major shift in the microbiome of patients suffering of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have also been observed and is linked to a worst outcome of the disease. As many co-morbidities are already known to be associated with a dysbiosis of the microbiome such as hypertension, diabetes and metabolic disorders. Host factors and microbiome changes are believed to be involved as a network in the acquisition of the infection and the development of the diseases. We will review in detail in this manuscript, the immune response toward SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the host factors involved in the facilitation and worsening of the infection. We will also address the impact of COVID-19 on the host's microbiome and secondary infection which also worsen the disease.	Mechanism;Treatment
34220859	Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells as a Potential Biomarker and Therapeutic Target in COVID-19. Clinical presentations of COVID-19 are highly variable, yet the precise mechanisms that govern the pathophysiology of different disease courses remain poorly defined. Across the spectrum of disease severity, COVID-19 impairs both innate and adaptive host immune responses by activating innate immune cell recruitment, while resulting in low lymphocyte counts. Recently, several reports have shown that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit a dysregulated myeloid cell compartment, with increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) correlating with disease severity. MDSCs, in turn, promote virus survival by suppressing T-cell responses and driving a highly pro-inflammatory state through the secretion of various mediators of immune activation. Here, we summarize the evidence on MDSCs and myeloid cell dysregulation in COVID-19 infection and discuss the potential of MDSCs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in COVID-19 pneumonia and associated disease.

34283845	"Relative sensitivity of anterior nares and nasopharyngeal swabs for initial detection of SARS-CoV-2 in ambulatory patients: Rapid review and meta-analysis. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are considered ""gold standard"" for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections, but anterior nares or mid-turbinate swabs (nasal swabs) are often used. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the sensitivity of nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs against a composite reference standard for the initial diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ambulatory patients. The study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020221827). Data sources included studies appearing between January 1, 2020 and March 20, 2021, identified by searches of PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. Studies included at least 20 subjects who simultaneously provided nasal and nasopharyngeal specimens for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, and for which confusion matrices could be constructed. Authors individually assessed studies for inclusion and compared assessments. Each author independently extracted all data elements; differences were reconciled by review of initial data sources. Extracted data included specimen site, patient characteristics, collection site, and confusion matrices comparing results for nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs. Assessed against a composite reference standard, anterior nares swabs are less sensitive (82% - 88%) than nasopharyngeal swabs (98%). For populations with 10% specimen positivity, the negative predictive values of all swab types were greater than 98%. Mid-turbinate and anterior nares swabs seem to perform similarly. The lower sensitivity associated with nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is justified by the ability to screen more patients and reduced personal protective equipment requirements. Our conclusions are limited by the small number of studies and the significant heterogeneity of study designs and study outcomes."	Diagnosis
34204689	Strengthening Country Readiness for Pandemic-Related Mass Movement: Policy Lessons Learned. The COVID-19 pandemic has thus far restricted the large movement of people; nonetheless, we cannot exclude the disruptive power of a virus with similar characteristics to COVID-19 affecting both high- and low-income countries, as a factor for future mass migrations. Indeed, the top 15 countries affected by COVID-19 host about 9 million refugees, and it is, therefore, important to investigate and strengthen the readiness of countries' health policies to ensure they are well equipped to deal with potential large influxes of 'epidemic-related refugees and migrants.' Using the Bardach Policy Framework as a tool for analysis, this article investigates the readiness of countries for a potential public health event (mass migration generated by future pandemics), therefore, aiming at a health response forecasting exercise. The article reviews the policies put in place by countries who faced large influxes of migrants between 2011 and 2015 (the policy-prolific years between the Arab Spring migration and the introduction of stringent measures in Europe) and new evidence generated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (including the 'ECDC Guidance on infection prevention and control of COVID-19 in migrant and refugee reception and detention centres in the EU/EEA and the UK' and the 'WHO Lancet priority for dealing with migration and COVID-19') to formulate a policy option able to strengthen national system capacities for responding to influxes of epidemic-related migrants and the management of highly infectious diseases.

34225131	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 infection (COVID-19) in pregnancy - An overview. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 which causes COVID-19 disease results in severe morbidity and mortality especially in vulnerable groups. Pregnancy by virtue of its physiological and anatomical adaptations increases the risk of severe infections especially those of the respiratory tract. This single stranded RNA virus is transmitted by droplets as well as soiled fomites. There are various degrees of disease severity- asymptomatic, mild, moderate severe and critical. Most infections in pregnancy are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. For these women, the consequences on the mother or pregnancy are minimal unless they have additional risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity or are of ethnic minority background. Most women with symptoms will present with fever, unproductive cough, sore throat, myalgia, nasal congestion, loss of smell and taste with associated leukocytosis and lymphopenia. Diagnosis is by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal flocked swabs or saliva and pathognomonic features of ground-glass appearance and pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray or CT scans. Management in pregnancy is same as that for non-pregnant women with COVID-19. It is not an indication for elective delivery but assisted delivery in the second stage for those with moderate, severe or critical disease may be required to shorten this stage. COVID-19 is not an indication for interrupting pregnancy or caesarean section but the latter may be performed to facilitate ventilation support or resuscitation in those with severe disease. Pain relief in labour should not be different but regional analgesia is preferred for operative deliveries. Postpartum thromboprophylaxis should be considered and breast feeding encouraged with appropriate precautions to minimize vertical transmission. Pregnant and lactating women should be encouraged to receive the mRNA based vaccines as there is no evidence of adverse outcomes with these.	Diagnosis;Transmission;Treatment
34333308	Compliance with hand sanitizer quality during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Assessing the impurities in an ethanol plant. Using alcohol-based disinfectants is an effective method for preventing the spread of COVID-19. However, non-traditional manufacturers of alcohol-based disinfectants, such as ethanol plants, need to undergo additional treatment to curb their impurities to limits set by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) to produce alcohol-based disinfectants. To transform them to disinfectant-grade alcohol, 17 process streams in a dry-mill ethanol plant were analyzed to determine the quality parameters for acetaldehyde, acetal, propanol, methanol, and water, including chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, and nutrients. Results suggest that the process stream generated by the distillation column requires further treatment because the acetaldehyde and acetal concentrations are significantly higher than the impurity limit set by the FDA. The addition of a second distillation column could be a potential method for addressing impurities and it will have minimal influence on hazardous air pollutant generation and water use.	Prevention
34214287	Experiences of Parents of Preterm Children Hospitalized Regarding Restrictions to Interact with Their Children Imposed Because of the COVID-19 Pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences of parents of hospitalized preterm children regarding the restrictions implemented in the neonatal intensive care unit -NICU- during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted between April and October 2020 with 12 parents of preterm children, whose children were hospitalized and discharged from NICU during the pandemic. The analysis was performed with tools from grounded theory through open and axial coding. RESULTS: The study identified four categories regarding the experience: 1) needing information: refers to the need for clear and close information to compensate for the physical distance; 2) limiting the interaction with the children: expressed as a painful situation, which minimizes opportunities for learning to care at home for their preterm child; 3) the pandemic: adding to the fears: in which the virus appears as a new threat for the children, who are vulnerable given their premature condition; and 4) limiting social support after discharge: identifies that the parents had less family and professional support for care after discharge during times of pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Parents of preterm children lived a difficult experience that became complex within the context of the pandemic. The experiences of parents of preterm children during times of COVID-19 indicate that restrictions to enter neonatal units to prevent the virus transmission limited the interaction with the preterm child and with the health staff and increased the needs for information.

34353099	Lung ultrasound correlates with radiographic severity and pattern in COVID-19 pneumonia: a preliminary study. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was outbreaking in late 2019 and a proportion of patients developed to pneumonia. Although chest CT is a pivotal diagnostic tool for COVID-19 pneumonia, CT is expensive and also radiological burden for patients. There is urgent to investigate the role of lung ultrasound (LUS) in diagnosing and monitoring COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A total of 8 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in Shantou Central Hospital from January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively studied. All participants underwent chest HRCT and LUS examination; both were independently performed within 1 day of the other. The radiological patterns were reviewed by 2 radiologists who were blind to the clinical information. A senior ultrasound physician, blind to HRCT results and clinical data, performed bedside LUS in the isolation ward. The CT score was used (a semi-quantitative scoring system) to assess radiographic severity and extent. A B-lines score denoting the extent and severity of sonographic lesion was calculated by summing the number of B-lines on 18 scanning sites. RESULTS: B-lines (100%), pleural irregularities (25%), consolidation (25%), and pleural effusion (25%) were the main findings of LUS examination. Interstitial abnormalities, ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations and local or bilateral patchy shadowing were the main findings of HRCT examination. The findings of LUS and HRCT were compared point to point and high consistency was found between the 2 measurements. A significant correlation was also found between the B-lines score and CT score [r=0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81 to 0.99, P=0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Both LUS patterns and B-lines score are significantly correlated with HRCT findings and score, respectively, supporting its role in assessing COVID-19 pneumonia severity, screening, and following up dynamic changes of pneumonia.

34203839	The Bone Marrow as Sanctuary for Plasma Cells and Memory T-Cells: Implications for Adaptive Immunity and Vaccinology. The bone marrow (BM) is key to protective immunological memory because it harbors a major fraction of the body's plasma cells, memory CD4+ and memory CD8+ T-cells. Despite its paramount significance for the human immune system, many aspects of how the BM enables decade-long immunity against pathogens are still poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the relationship between BM survival niches and long-lasting humoral immunity, how intrinsic and extrinsic factors define memory cell longevity and show that the BM is also capable of adopting many responsibilities of a secondary lymphoid organ. Additionally, with more and more data on the differentiation and maintenance of memory T-cells and plasma cells upon vaccination in humans being reported, we discuss what factors determine the establishment of long-lasting immunological memory in the BM and what we can learn for vaccination technologies and antigen design. Finally, using these insights, we touch on how this holistic understanding of the BM is necessary for the development of modern and efficient vaccines against the pandemic SARS-CoV-2.

34214871	Role of hepatosteatosis in the prognosis of COVID 19 disease. PURPOSE: To measure the degree of fatty liver using non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) and investigate its relationship with the severity and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adult patients. METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and subsequently underwent non-contrast enhanced chest CT between October 10 and December 10, 2020. Hepatic attenuation values were measured from Couinaud segments 2, 4, and 8 based on the CT images and the relationships between these values and the Pneumonia Severity Score (PSS), requirement of hospitalization, and the length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 414 patients (182 were female, 43.96%), among whom 106 (25.6%) were diagnosed with hepatosteatosis (HS). In the patients with HS, the PSS scores were higher (10.8 +/- 4.96 vs. 8.07 +/- 5.12; p < 0.001), and 69 (65%) received inpatient care. Moreover, the number of HS patients who received inpatient care was 1.99 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-3.15, p < 0.003) times higher than that of the non-HS patients. No significant difference was found between the HS and non-HS patients with regard to the length of hospital or ICU stay. CONCLUSION: HS can be easily evaluated using non-contrast enhanced chest CT in COVID-19 patients and can be used as a prognostic marker to determine the requirement of hospitalization.

34360477	Detection of SARS-CoV-2 on Surfaces in Households of Persons with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 transmission from contaminated surfaces, or fomites, has been a concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Households have been important sites of transmission throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is limited information on SARS-CoV-2 contamination of surfaces in these settings. We describe environmental detection of SARS-CoV-2 in households of persons with COVID-19 to better characterize the potential risks of fomite transmission. Ten households with >/=1 person with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and with >/=2 members total were enrolled in Utah, U.S.A. Nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal swabs were collected from members and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Fifteen surfaces were sampled in each household and tested for presence and viability of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 23 (15%) of 150 environmental swab samples, most frequently on nightstands (4/6; 67%), pillows (4/23; 17%), and light switches (3/21; 14%). Viable SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from one sample. All households with SARS-CoV-2-positive surfaces had >/=1 person who first tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 </= 6 days prior to environmental sampling. SARS-CoV-2 surface contamination occurred early in the course of infection when respiratory transmission is most likely, notably on surfaces in close, prolonged contact with persons with COVID-19. While fomite transmission might be possible, risk is low.	Diagnosis;Prevention;Transmission
34227081	Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells modulate TNF and soluble TNF Receptor 2 (sTNFR2) in COVID-19 ARDS patients. OBJECTIVE: We aimed at explaining the mechanism of therapeutic effect of Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSC) in subjects with COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Patients with COVID-19 ARDS present with a hyperinflammatory response characterized by high levels of circulating pro-inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and beta (TNFalpha and TNFbeta). Inflammatory functions of these TNFs can be inhibited by soluble TNF Receptor 2 (sTNFR2). In patients with COVID-19 ARDS, UC-MSC appear to impart a robust anti-inflammatory effect, and treatment is associated with remarkable clinical improvements. We investigated the levels of TNFalpha, TNFbeta and sTNFR2 in blood plasma samples collected from subjects with COVID-19 ARDS enrolled in our trial of UC-MSC treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed plasma samples from subjects with COVID-19 ARDS (n=24) enrolled in a Phase 1/2a randomized controlled trial of UC-MSC treatment. Plasma samples were obtained at Day 0 (baseline, before UC-MSC or control infusion), and Day 6 post infusion. Plasma concentrations of sTNFR2, TNFalpha, and TNFbeta were evaluated using a quantitative multiplex protein array. RESULTS: Our data indicate that at Day 6 after infusion, UC-MSC recipients develop significantly increased levels of plasma sTNFR2 and significantly decreased levels of TNFalpha and TNFbeta, compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that sTNFR2 plays a mechanistic role in mediating UC-MSC effect on TNFalpha and TNFbeta plasma levels, determining a decrease in inflammation in COVID-19 ARDS.

34290876	Incidence and Outcomes of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Admitted to Hospital With COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study. Background: The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19 and its association with mortality and disease severity is understudied in the Canadian population. Objective: To determine the incidence of AKI in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to medicine and intensive care unit (ICU) wards, its association with in-hospital mortality, and disease severity. Our aim was to stratify these outcomes by out-of-hospital AKI and in-hospital AKI. Design: Retrospective cohort study from a registry of patients with COVID-19. Setting: Three community and 3 academic hospitals. Patients: A total of 815 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between March 4, 2020, and April 23, 2021. Measurements: Stage of AKI, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality. Methods: We classified AKI by comparing highest to lowest recorded serum creatinine in hospital and staged AKI based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) system. We calculated the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio for the stage of AKI and the outcomes of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality. Results: Of the 815 patients registered, 439 (53.9%) developed AKI, 253 (57.6%) presented with AKI, and 186 (42.4%) developed AKI in-hospital. The odds of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death increased as the AKI stage worsened. Stage 3 AKI that occurred during hospitalization increased the odds of death (odds ratio [OR] = 7.87 [4.35, 14.23]). Stage 3 AKI that occurred prior to hospitalization carried an increased odds of death (OR = 5.28 [2.60, 10.73]). Limitations: Observational study with small sample size limits precision of estimates. Lack of nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 and hospitalized patients without COVID-19 as controls limits causal inferences. Conclusions: Acute kidney injury, whether it occurs prior to or after hospitalization, is associated with a high risk of poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Routine assessment of kidney function in patients with COVID-19 may improve risk stratification. Trial registration: The study was not registered on a publicly accessible registry because it did not involve any health care intervention on human participants.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34211828	QT Interval Monitoring with Handheld Heart Rhythm ECG Device in COVID-19 Patients. Background: QTc prolongation is an adverse effect of COVID-19 therapies. The use of a handheld device in this scenario has not been addressed. Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility of QTc monitoring with a smart device in COVID-19 patients receiving QTc-interfering therapies. Methods: Prospective study of consecutive COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine +/- azithromycin +/- lopinavir-ritonavir. ECG monitoring was performed with 12-lead ECG or with KardiaMobile-6L. Both registries were also sequentially obtained in a cohort of healthy patients. We evaluated differences in QTc in COVID-19 patients between three different monitoring strategies: 12-lead ECG at baseline and follow-up (A), 12-lead ECG at baseline and follow-up with the smart device (B), and fully monitored with handheld 6-lead ECG (group C). Time needed to obtain an ECG registry was also documented. Results: One hundred and eighty-two COVID-19 patients were included (A: 119(65.4%); B: 50(27.5%); C: 13(7.1%). QTc peak during hospitalization did significantly increase in all groups. No differences were observed between the three monitoring strategies in QTc prolongation (p = 0.864). In the control group, all but one ECG registry with the smart device allowed QTc measurement and mean QTc did not differ between both techniques (p = 0.612), displaying a moderate reliability (ICC 0.56 [0.19-0.76]). Time of ECG registry was significantly longer for the 12-lead ECG than for handheld device in both cohorts (p < 0.001). Conclusion: QTc monitoring with KardiaMobile-6L in COVID-19 patients was feasible. Time of ECG registration was significantly lower with the smart device, which may offer an important advantage for prevention of virus dissemination among healthcare providers.	Treatment;Diagnosis
34211026	High-precision and cost-efficient sequencing for real-time COVID-19 surveillance. COVID-19 global cases have climbed to more than 33 million, with over a million total deaths, as of September, 2020. Real-time massive SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is key to tracking chains of transmission and estimating the origin of disease outbreaks. Yet no methods have simultaneously achieved high precision, simple workflow, and low cost. We developed a high-precision, cost-efficient SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing platform for COVID-19 genomic surveillance, CorvGenSurv (Coronavirus Genomic Surveillance). CorvGenSurv directly amplified viral RNA from COVID-19 patients' Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab specimens and sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome in three segments by long-read, high-throughput sequencing. Sequencing of the whole genome in three segments significantly reduced sequencing data waste, thereby preventing dropouts in genome coverage. We validated the precision of our pipeline by both control genomic RNA sequencing and Sanger sequencing. We produced near full-length whole genome sequences from individuals who were COVID-19 test positive during April to June 2020 in Los Angeles County, California, USA. These sequences were highly diverse in the G clade with nine novel amino acid mutations including NSP12-M755I and ORF8-V117F. With its readily adaptable design, CorvGenSurv grants wide access to genomic surveillance, permitting immediate public health response to sudden threats.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
32826425	A National Pre-Pandemic Survey of Patient-Reported Health Confidence and Implications for Post-Pandemic Practice. Patient-reported health confidence is a valuable indicator of effective patient-clinician communication, which improves outcomes and reduces costly care use. This national survey examines health confidence attainment in the United States before the COVID pandemic strained health care resources. Health confidence was low for both the percentage of respondents who were financially secure (36%) and financially insecure (18%). Persons enrolled in employer- and union-sponsored plans, who had the highest household income, did not report higher levels of health confidence. Health policy should support the measurement and monitoring of health confidence in clinical practice to improve population health and maximize resource efficiency.	Prevention
34222416	Dynamics of host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the most recent global health threat, is spreading throughout the world with worrisome speed, and the current wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seems to have no mercy. While this mysterious virus challenges our ability to control viral infections, our opportunities to control the COVID-19 pandemic are gradually fading. Currently, pandemic management relies on preventive interventions. Although prevention is a good strategy to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it still cannot be considered an absolute solution to eliminate this pandemic. Currently, developing a potent immunity against this viral infection seems to be the most promising strategy to drive down this ongoing global tragedy. However, with the emergence of new challenges in the context of immune responses to COVID-19, the road to control this devastating pandemic seems bumpier; thus, it is pivotal to characterize the dynamics of host immune responses to COVID-19, in order to develop efficient prophylactic and therapeutic tools. This begs the question of whether the effector mechanisms of the immune system are indeed potent or a possible contributing factor to developing more severe and lethal forms of COVID-19. In this review, the possible role of the immunopathologic phenomena including antibody-dependent enhancement, cytokine storm, and original antigenic sin in severity and mortality of COVID-19 will be discussed.

34205992	An Immunoinformatics Approach for SARS-CoV-2 in Latam Populations and Multi-Epitope Vaccine Candidate Directed towards the World's Population. The coronavirus pandemic is a major public health crisis affecting global health systems with dire socioeconomic consequences, especially in vulnerable regions such as Latin America (LATAM). There is an urgent need for a vaccine to help control contagion, reduce mortality and alleviate social costs. In this study, we propose a rational multi-epitope candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Using bioinformatics, we constructed a library of potential vaccine peptides, based on the affinity of the most common major human histocompatibility complex (HLA) I and II molecules in the LATAM population to predict immunological complexes among antigenic, non-toxic and non-allergenic peptides extracted from the conserved regions of 92 proteomes. Although HLA-C, had the greatest antigenic peptide capacity from SARS-CoV-2, HLA-B and HLA-A, could be more relevant based on COVID-19 risk of infection in LATAM countries. We also used three-dimensional structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to identify potential regions for antibody production. The best HLA-I and II predictions (with increased coverage in common alleles and regions evoking B lymphocyte responses) were grouped into an optimized final multi-epitope construct containing the adjuvants Beta defensin-3, TpD, and PADRE, which are recognized for invoking a safe and specific immune response. Finally, we used Molecular Dynamics to identify the multi-epitope construct which may be a stable target for TLR-4/MD-2. This would prove to be safe and provide the physicochemical requirements for conducting experimental tests around the world.	Mechanism;Treatment
34226453	Clinical Features of Covid-19 Infection: a Study of SARS-CoV-2 Positive Patients from Mymensingh Region, in Bangladesh. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to almost every country on the globe and it is considered by World Health Organization as a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many of country are reporting the symptomatic characteristics of their cases to give better observations into the various clinical presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the symptomatic literature is limited in Bangladesh. The aim of the study is to analyze the symptomatic characteristics of patients having the SARS-CoV-2 positive by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT -PCR) test. Here, the data of 146 patients who were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and were residents of different districts of Mymensingh region were analyzed. Patients' demographics, symptoms, history of co-morbidities condition like DM, HTN, Hypothyroid etc, travel and contact were collected from MMC Daily Reported data from April 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020. Among the total 3184 patients' nasopharyngeal samples, we have got 146 (4.58%) positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 146 positive patients most of the patients were male 95(65%), the majority 80(54.8%) were the 21 to 40year age group. Most of the patients 61(41.78%) were residents of Mymensingh include Mymensingh Sadar, Valuka, Trishal and Ishhorganj. Among the patients 94(64.4%) were symptomatic and 52(35.6%) were asymptomatic. The symptomatic patients presented mostly were with fever 45(30.82%), cough 33(22.6%) and breathlessness 9(6.16%). The majority of patients 54(36.9%) had a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients and 16(11%) had a travel history within 14 days of their rRT-PCR test positive. The only 3(2%) patients had history of comorbidities condition like DM, HTN, Hypothyroid etc. The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases is rapidly increasing in our country. The education of the population about the most common symptoms of the virus infection is needed mostly; therefore, individuals may able to recognize these symptoms. So, that people might get themselves tested.	Diagnosis

34222270	Quality of and Recommendations for Relevant Clinical Practice Guidelines for COVID-19 Management: A Systematic Review and Critical Appraisal. Background: The morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still increasing. This study aimed to assess the quality of relevant COVID-19 clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and to compare the similarities and differences between recommendations. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted using electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) and representative guidelines repositories from December 1, 2019, to August 11, 2020 (updated to April 5, 2021), to obtain eligible CPGs. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) tool was used to evaluate the quality of CPGs. Four authors extracted relevant information and completed data extraction forms. All data were analyzed using R version 3.6.0 software. Results: In total, 39 CPGs were identified and the quality was not encouragingly high. The median score (interquartile range, IQR) of every domain from AGREE II for evidence-based CPGs (EB-CPGs) versus (vs.) consensus-based CPG (CB-CPGs) was 81.94% (75.00-84.72) vs. 58.33% (52.78-68.06) in scope and purpose, 59.72% (38.89-75.00) vs. 36.11% (33.33-36.11) in stakeholder involvement, 64.58% (32.29-71.88) vs. 22.92% (16.67-26.56) in rigor of development, 75.00% (52.78-86.81) vs. 52.78% (50.00-63.89) in clarity of presentation, 40.63% (22.40-62.50) vs. 20.83% (13.54-25.00) in applicability, and 58.33% (50.00-100.00) vs. 50.00% (50.00-77.08) in editorial independence, respectively. The methodological quality of EB-CPGs were significantly superior to the CB-CPGs in the majority of domains (P < 0.05). There was no agreement on diagnosis criteria of COVID-19. But a few guidelines show Remdesivir may be beneficial for the patients, hydroxychloroquine +/- azithromycin may not, and there were more consistent suggestions regarding discharge management. For instance, after discharge, isolation management and health status monitoring may be continued. Conclusions: In general, the methodological quality of EB-CPGs is greater than CB-CPGs. However, it is still required to be further improved. Besides, the consistency of COVID-19 recommendations on topics such as diagnosis criteria is different. Of them, hydroxychloroquine +/- azithromycin may be not beneficial to treat patients with COVID-19, but remdesivir may be a favorable risk-benefit in severe COVID-19 infection; isolation management and health status monitoring after discharge may be still necessary. Chemoprophylaxis, including SARS-CoV 2 vaccines and antiviral drugs of COVID-19, still require more trials to confirm this.	Treatment;Diagnosis
34203317	Preconception Care for Men and Women during the Pandemic, an Intervention Proposal. The COVID-19 pandemic and its measures resulted in limited outdoor activities, reduced group meetings, etc., leading to unhealthy habits. Several studies showed how certain unhealthy habits can lead to serious consequences for both men and women, as well as affect future offspring. (1) Background: Therefore, we present a community intervention at the preconception stage to avoid future risks. The purpose of this intervention is to change lifestyles and beliefs about the health of men and women in the preconception period; (2) Methods: For the design of the intervention, a bibliographic search was performed both in English and Spanish in the main databases of health sciences and nursing (Cochrane, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, LILACS, Dialnet), using descriptors in MeSH health for sciences; (3) Results: We proposed that a variety of lifestyles be analyzed, including aspects such as physical activity, nutrition, etc. In addition, stress management should be emphasized through a relaxation workshop, where three different techniques be proposed to reduce anxiety levels in stressful situations; (4) Conclusions: Due to the limited scientific results of interventions carried out in the preconception period simultaneously with men and women, more community interventions that address this topic are needed to assess the impact of these actions on the health of the population.

34199734	Short-Term Efficacy and Safety of Oral and Nasal Corticosteroids in COVID-19 Patients with Olfactory Dysfunction: A European Multicenter Study. Background: The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of early administration of oral corticosteroids (OC) or nasal corticosteroids (NC) as an add-on to olfactory training (OT) versus OT alone in patients with olfactory dysfunction (OD) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: Patients with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 and OD were prospectively recruited from March 22 to December 15, 2020 from 4 European hospitals. Patients had confirmed OD on psychophysical testing. All patients undertook OT, with add-on 10 days of OC (group 1: OC + OT), or 1 month of NC (group 2: NC + OT) or olfactory training alone (group 3: OT). Olfactory evaluations (Sniffin'Sticks tests) were carried out at the time of inclusion, 1 and 2 months after the start of the therapeutic course. Results: A total of 152 hyposmic or anosmic patients completed the study. Group 1, 2 and 3 included 59, 22 and 71 patients, respectively and all patient groups were comparable regarding baseline Sniffin'Sticks tests. The median Sniffin'Sticks test values significantly improved from pre- to post-intervention in all groups. The increase of Sniffin'Sticks test values was higher in group 1 (OC + OT) compared with groups 2 and 3 (p < 0.001) at one month after treatment but did not remain so at 2 months. Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, presented parosmia in 20/71 (28.2%), 9/22 (40.9%) and 42/71 (59.2%) patients. This difference was statistically significant between group 1 and 3 (p < 0.001). There were no patients with a worsening of the disease or an increase of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions: The use of OCs in patients with OD related to mild COVID-19 is generally well-tolerated without any case of deterioration of symptoms. OC is associated with greater improvement in psychophysical olfactory evaluations at 1-month post-treatment but there was no difference at 2 months. Parosmia may be reduced following treatment with OC and NC. On the basis of these preliminary results, it is possible to state that considering the 2 months efficacy of OC and NC with respect to the OT alone and the risk-benefit ratio, the benefit to start a specific treatment of COVID-19 related OD cannot be demonstrated and there is a need for a randomised controlled trial to assess this further.

34199572	Association of Frailty with Adverse Outcomes in Patients with Suspected COVID-19 Infection. Older age and frailty are predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. In emergency medicine, patients do not present with the diagnosis, but with suspicion of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the association of frailty and age with death or admission to intensive care in patients with suspected COVID-19. This single-centre prospective cohort study was performed in the Emergency Department of a tertiary care hospital. Patients, 65 years and older, with suspected COVID-19 presenting to the Emergency Department during the first wave of the pandemic were consecutively enrolled. All patients underwent nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab tests. Patients with a Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) > 4, were considered to be frail. Associations between age, gender, frailty, and COVID-19 status with the composite adverse outcome of 30-day-intensive-care-admission and/or 30-day-mortality were tested. In the 372 patients analysed, the median age was 77 years, 154 (41.4%) were women, 44 (11.8%) were COVID-19-positive, and 125 (33.6%) were frail. The worst outcome was seen in frail COVID-19-patients with six (66.7%) adverse outcomes. Frailty (CFS > 4) and COVID-19-positivity were associated with an adverse outcome after adjustment for age and gender (frailty: OR 5.01, CI 2.56-10.17, p < 0.001; COVID-19: OR 3.47, CI 1.48-7.89, p = 0.003). Frailty was strongly associated with adverse outcomes and outperformed age as a predictor in emergency patients with suspected COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34210280	Lymphocyte subset alterations with disease severity, imaging manifestation, and delayed hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 continuously threated public health heavily. Present study aimed to investigate the lymphocyte subset alterations with disease severity, imaging manifestation, and delayed hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Lymphocyte subsets was classified using flow cytometry with peripheral blood collected from 106 patients. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression showed that chest tightness, lymphocyte count, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were the independent predictors for severe COVID-19. The T cell, CD4(+) T cell and B cell counts in severe patients were significantly lower than that in mild patients (p = 0.004, 0.003 and 0.046, respectively). Only the T cell count was gradually decreased with the increase of infiltrated quadrants of lesions in computed tomography (CT) (p = 0.043). The T cell, CD4(+) T cell, and CD8(+) T cell counts were gradually decreased with the increase of infiltrated area of the maximum lesion in CT (p = 0.002, 0.003, 0.028; respectively). For severe patients, the counts of T cell, CD4(+) T cell, CD8(+) T cell gradually decreased with the increased delayed hospitalization (p = 0.001, 0.03, and < 0.001, respectively). The proportions of T cell, CD8(+) T cell gradually decreased with the increased delayed hospitalization (both p < 0.001), but the proportions of NK cell, B cell gradually increased with the increased delayed hospitalization (p = 0.007, and 0.002, respectively). For mild patients, only the NK cell count was gradually decreased with the increased delayed hospitalization (p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: T lymphocyte and its subset negatively correlated with disease severity, CT manifestation and delayed hospitalization. The counts of lymphocyte subset were changed more profound than their proportions.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34203769	Prevalence and Risk Factors of CoronaVac Side Effects: An Independent Cross-Sectional Study among Healthcare Workers in Turkey. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is a serious threat to mass vaccination strategies that need to be accelerated currently in order to achieve a substantial level of community immunity. Independent (non-sponsored) studies have a great potential to enhance public confidence in vaccines and accelerate their uptake process. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional study for the side effects (SE) of CoronaVac was carried out in February 2021 among Turkish healthcare workers who were recently vaccinated. The questionnaire inquired about local and systemic SEs that occurred in the short-term, within four weeks, following vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 780 healthcare workers were included in this study; 62.5% of them experienced at least one SE. Injection site pain (41.5%) was the most common local SE, while fatigue (23.6%), headache (18.7%), muscle pain (11.2%) and joint pain (5.9%) were the common systemic SEs. Female healthcare workers (67.9%) were significantly more affected by local and systemic SEs than male colleagues (51.4%). Younger age, previous infection, and compromised health status (chronic illnesses and regular medicines uptake) can be associated with an increased risk of CoronaVac SEs; Conclusions: The independent research shows a higher prevalence of CoronaVac SEs than what is reported by phase I-III clinical trials. In general, the results of this study confirm the overall safety of CoronaVac and suggest potential risk factors for its SEs. Gender-based differences and SEs distribution among age groups are worth further investigation.	Treatment
34285042	Responding to the COVID-19 second wave in Thailand by diversifying and adapting lessons from the first wave. Thailand's first wave of COVID-19 in March 2020 was triggered from boxing events and nightclubs in Bangkok, which spread to 68 provinces. The nation responded rapidly with strong public health and social measures on 26 March 2020. Contact tracing was performed by over 1000 surveillance and rapid response teams with support from 1.1 million village health volunteers to identify, isolate and quarantine cases.Thailand implemented social measures in April 2020 including a full-scale national lockdown, curfews and 14-day mandatory quarantine for international travellers. With a strong health system infrastructure, people's adherence to social measures and a whole-of-government approach, the first wave recorded only 3042 cases and 57 deaths with 1.46% case fatality rate. Economic activities were resumed on 1 May 2020 until the end of the year. On 17 December 2020, a second wave was carried by undocumented migrants who were not captured by the quarantine system. As the total lockdown earlier led to serious negative economic impact, the government employed a targeted strategy, locking down specific areas and employing active case finding. Essential resources including case finding teams, clinicians and medicine were mobilised.With synergistic multisectoral efforts involving health, non-health and private sector, the outbreak was contained in February 2021. Total cases were seven times higher than the first wave, however, early admission and treatment resulted in 0.11% case fatality rate. In conclusion, experiences of responding to the first wave informed the second wave response with targeted locking down of affected localities and active case findings in affected sites.	Prevention
34289406	Anterior uveitis onset after bnt162b2 vaccination: is this just a coincidence? BACKGROUND: Uveitis is a vision-threatening inflammation and is considered an ophthalmic emergency. It generally arises as a result of autoimmune conditions, infections, or ocular trauma, but it may also occur as an isolated disorder. Over the past decades, several cases of vaccine-associated uveitis have been described, with the hepatitis B virus vaccine being the leading cause. CLINICAL CASE: A case of anterior uveitis in a 23-year-old male, with onset 14 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine, is reported here. Initial symptoms were pain, photophobia, and red eye. Ocular examination showed pericheratic and conjunctival hyperaemia, posterior synechiae, and anterior chamber cells +/- keratic precipitates in the lower quadrants. The posterior segment did not show any alteration, and optical coherence tomography ruled out the presence of cystoid macular oedema. After a 10-day treatment course of topical steroids and cycloplegic eye drops, the ocular inflammatory signs disappeared and visual acuity was completely restored. Even if causality remains presumed, a warning should be given to physicians about the possibility of eye inflammation following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.	Case Report
34367931	Exploiting epidemiological data to understand the epidemiology and factors that influence COVID-19 pandemic in Libya. There were only 75 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported in Libya by the National Center for Disease Control during the first two months following the first confirmed case on 24 March 2020. However, there was dramatic increase in positive cases from June to now; as of 19 November 2020, approximately 357940 samples have been tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the results have revealed a total number of 76808 confirmed cases, 47587 recovered cases and 1068 deaths. The case fatality ratio was estimated to be 1.40%, and the mortality rate was estimated to be 15.90 in 100000 people. The epidemiological situation markedly changed from mid-July to the beginning of August, and the country proceeded to the cluster phase. COVID-19 has spread in almost all Libyan cities, and this reflects the high transmission rate of the virus at the regional level with the highest positivity rates, at an average of 14.54%. Apparently, there is an underestimation of the actual number of COVID-19 cases due to the low testing capacity. Consequently, the Libyan health authority needs to initiate a large-scale case-screening process and enforce testing capacities and contact testing within the time frame, which is not an easy task. Advisably, the Libyan health authority should improve the public health capacities and conduct strict hygienic measures among the societies and vaccinate as many people against COVID-19 to minimize both the case fatality ratio and socio-economic impacts of the pandemic in Libya.

34292768	Remote Patient Monitoring Identifies the Need for Triage in Patients with Acute COVID-19 Infection. Background: Telehealth was frequently used in the provision of care and remote patient monitoring (RPM) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Precision Recovery Program (PRP) remotely monitored and supported patients with COVID-19 in their home environment. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study reviewing data acquired from the PRP clinical initiative. Results: Of the 679 patients enrolled in the PRP, 156 patients were screened by a clinician following a deterioration in symptoms and vital signs on a total of 240 occasions, and included in the analyses. Of these 240 occasions, 162 (67%) were escalated to the PRP physician. Thirty-six patients were referred to emergency department, with 12 (7%) admitted to the hospital. The most common risk factors coinciding with hospital admissions were cardiac (67%), age >65 (42%), obesity (25%), and pulmonary (17%). The most common symptoms reported that triggered a screening event were dyspnea/tachypnea (27%), chest pain (14%), and gastrointestinal issues (8%). Vital signs that commonly triggered a screening event were pulse oximetry (15%), heart rate (11%), and temperature (9%). Discussion: Common factors (risk factors, vital signs, and symptoms) among patients requiring screening, triage, and hospitalization were identified, providing clinicians with further information to support decision making when utilizing RPM in this cohort. Conclusion: A clinician-led RPM program for patients with acute COVID-19 infection provided supportive care and screening for deterioration. Similar models should be considered for implementation in COVID-19 cohorts and other conditions at risk of rapid clinical deterioration in the home setting.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34132262	Development of nano affinity columns for the study of ligand (including SARS-CoV-2 related proteins) binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The interactions of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) present on the cell surface with target proteins lead to cell signaling and they are considered as viral receptors. The analysis of the recognition mechanism between HSPG and its potential ligands and high-throughput screening in drug discovery thus remain important challenges. Glycidyl methacrylate-based monoliths were thus prepared in situ in miniaturized capillary columns (internal diameter 75 mum) and HSPG was grafted onto them by the use of the Schiff base method. The quantity of grafted HSPG was in the nanogram range (11 nanograms per cm of capillary length). This is of significant importance when working with less available or expensive biological material. Other advantages of our miniaturized capillary column are as follows: (i) the immobilization process of HSPG onto the organic monolithic support was reliable and reproducible. (ii) The resultant affinity capillary column showed a strong resistance to changes in temperature and pH and a negligible non-specific interaction. So as to confirm the proper functioning of our miniaturized capillary column, the molecular recognition by HSPG of five selected compounds including three ligands of interest related to SARS-CoV-2 was studied.

34334321	Elite athletes with COVID-19 - Predictors of the course of disease. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to identify predictors determining the course of COVID-19 and antibody response in elite athletes. DESIGN: Observational study. METHODS: Routine medical screening with physical examination, resting ECG, and laboratory tests including antibody response was performed 12-68days after the diagnosis of COVID-19 in 111 athletes of different sports. RESULTS: Clinical symptoms were observed in 84% of subjects. The severity of COVID-19 was mild in 82% of athletes and moderate in 2% of cases. Athletes aged above 26 and male were more likely to develop symptomatic COVID-19. Asymptomatic subjects were younger and predominantly female. In 18% of subjects, symptoms were still present 20 (12-68) days (median and range) since positive diagnosis. Antibody response was observed in 88% of athletes, and its magnitude correlated with time since diagnosis of COVID-19 (RT-PCR), fatigue, fever, and conjunctivitis. There were no differences in antibody response between groups distinguished by sports discipline (p=0.50), and sex (p=0.59), and antibody response did not correlate with BMI (p=0.12), age (p=0.13), the number of symptoms (p=0.43) or their duration (p=0.19). CONCLUSIONS: The severity of COVID-19 in elite athletes is predominantly mild and without complications. Athletes can return to sport after two symptom-free weeks and additional heart screening is usually not required. Determination of antibodies has been shown to be a useful indicator of a previous COVID-19 disease, and some symptoms can be used as predictors of antibody response.	Diagnosis;Treatment

34203277	"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in an Adult (MIS-A) Successfully Treated with Anakinra and Glucocorticoids. During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a novel syndrome termed ""multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"" (MIS-C) has emerged. MIS-C was linked to COVID-19 and shared some features with Kawasaki disease and Toxic Shock Syndrome, with a common pathogenetic substrate of hyperinflammation and cytokine storm. Lately, MIS was also described in adults (>/=21 years of age) and named ""MIS-A"". There is no consensus about the treatment of MIS-A; successful use of glucocorticoids and immunoglobulins has been reported in case series, but more solid evidence is lacking. Furthermore, the role of biologic agents with proven benefits against COVID-19, MIS-C, or Kawasaki disease is still unexplored. In this report, we detail the clinical picture and the diagnostic process that led to the diagnosis of MIS-A in a 27-year-old man, focusing on its treatment with anakinra and glucocorticoids, which resulted in full recovery. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the successful use of anakinra for MIS-A, a drug that has already proven useful in the treatment of refractive cases of MIS-C. Anakinra may also play a pivotal role for the treatment of MIS-A."	Case Report
34224085	Modulation of ACE-2 mRNA by inflammatory cytokines in human thyroid cells: a pilot study. INTRODUCTION: Angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE-2) was demonstrated to be the receptor for cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. ACE-2 mRNA was identified in several human tissues and recently also in thyroid cells in vitro. PURPOSE: Aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the ACE-2 mRNA levels in human thyroid cells in primary cultures. METHODS: Primary thyroid cell cultures were treated with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha alone or in combination for 24 h. ACE-2 mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR. As a control, the levels of IFN-gamma inducible chemokine (CXCL10) were measured in the respective cell culture supernatants. RESULTS: The mean levels of ACE-2 mRNA increased after treatment with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in all the thyroid cell preparations, while the combination treatment did not consistently synergically increase ACE-2-mRNA. At difference, CXCL10 was consistently increased by IFN-gamma and synergically further increased by the combination treatment with IFN-gamma + TNF-alpha, with respect to IFN-gamma alone. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study show that IFN-gamma and, to a lesser extent TNF-alpha consistently increase ACE-2 mRNA levels in NHT primary cultures. More interestingly, the combined stimulation (proven to be effective according to the synergic effect registered for CXCL10) produces different responses in terms of ACE-2 mRNA modulation. These results would suggest that elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines could facilitate the entering of the virus in cells by further increasing ACE-2 expression and/or account for the different degree of severity of SARS-COV-2 infection. This hypothesis deserves to be confirmed by further specific studies.	Mechanism;Treatment
34209269	Ocular and Systemic Manifestations in Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Associated with COVID-19. This study aimed to achieve a better understanding of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We searched PubMed and Embase between December 2019 and March 2021 and included only peer-reviewed clinical studies or case series. The proportions of patients who had conjunctivitis, systemic symptoms/signs (s/s), Kawasaki disease (KD), and exposure history to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases were obtained. Moreover, positive rates of the nasopharyngeal real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serum antibody for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were recorded. Overall, 32 studies with 1458 patients were included in the pooled analysis. Around half of the patients had conjunctivitis. The five most common systemic manifestations were fever (96.4%), gastrointestinal s/s (76.7%), shock (61.5%), rash (57.1%), and neurological s/s (36.8%). Almost one-third presented complete KD and about half had exposure history to COVID-19 cases. The positivity of the serology (82.2%) was higher than that of the nasopharyngeal RT-PCR (37.0%). MIS-C associated with COVID-19 leads to several features similar to KD. Epidemiological and laboratory findings suggest that post-infective immune dysregulation may play a predominant role. Further studies are crucial to elucidate the underlying pathogenesis.	Diagnosis
34217135	Natural killer cells and unconventional T cells in COVID-19. NK cells and diverse populations of unconventional T cells, such as MAIT cells, gammadelta T cells, invariant NKT cells, and DNTabeta cells are important early effector lymphocytes. While some of these cells, such as NK cell and MAIT cells, have well-established roles in antiviral defense, the function of other populations remains more elusive. Here, we summarize and discuss current knowledge on NK cell and unconventional T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also covered is the role of these cells in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. Understanding the early, both systemic and local (lung), effector lymphocyte response in this novel disease will likely aid ongoing efforts to combat the pandemic.	Mechanism;Treatment
34221846	Prediction and identification of T cell epitopes of COVID-19 with balanced cytokine response for the development of peptide based vaccines. Recent outbreak of 2019 novel Corona virus poses serious challenge for the global health system. In lieu of paucity of experimental data, tools and the very basic understanding of host immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, well thought effective measures are needed to control COVID-19 pandemic. We have identified specific overlapping antigenic peptide epitopes (OAPE) within the 4 structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 predictive of triggering robust CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in host using bio-informatics tools (NetMHC4.0, IEDB, and Vaxijen2.0). We speculate an early release of pro-inflammatory cytokines for protection and later release of anti-inflammatory cytokines for prevention of immunopathology in designing a vaccine for Covid-19. Therefore, the selected immunogenic OAPE were subjected to in silico tools (IL-6-Pred, IFNepitope and PIP-EL) for analyzing their pro-inflammatory response. The OAPEs found to be pro-inflammatory in nature were further subjected to prediction servers (IL-4-Pred, IL-10-Pred, Pre-AIP) to characterize them as inducers of anti-inflammatory response as well. We finally filtered out 12 OAPE which had affinity for both CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as were inducers of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. On confirmation of OAPE binding affinity for respective T cell specific MHC allele using docking studies (pepATTRACT, Hex8.0 and Discovery studio) they were found to be have more immunogenic potential than the 3 negative control peptides (NCPs) included in the study. Additionally, we constructed CTxB-adjuvanated multi-epitopic vaccine inclusive of the 12 OAPEs which was non-toxic, non-allergenic and capable of inducing both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. A successful in silico cloning and docking of modeled subunit vaccine construct with toll like receptor-2 (TLR-2) confirmed the high efficacy of our multi-epitopic vaccine which can through a balanced interplay of cytokines help in creating a steady-state immune equilibrium. In silico immune simulation studies with the vaccine using C-ImmSim server also showed higher percentage of T cells along with production of pro-inflammatory as well as some anti-inflammatory cytokines. Experimental validation of this prediction based study on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of un-infected individuals, patients and recovered individuals will facilitate production of high priority effective SARS -CoV-2 vaccine candidate.

34222586	Urticarial vasculitis. Urticarial vasculitis is a rare clinicopathologic entity that is characterized by chronic or recurrent episodes of urticarial lesions. Skin findings of this disease can be difficult to distinguish visually from those of chronic idiopathic urticaria but are unique in that individual lesions persist for >/=24 hours and can leave behind dusky hyperpigmentation. This disease is most often idiopathic but has been linked to certain drugs, infections, autoimmune connective disease, myelodysplastic disorders, and malignancies. More recently, some authors have reported associations between urticarial vasculitis and COVID-19, as well as influenza A/H1N1 infection. Urticarial vasculitis can extend systemically as well, most often affecting the musculoskeletal, renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and ocular systems. Features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis seen on histopathologic examination are diagnostic of this disease, but not always seen. In practice, antibiotics, dapsone, colchicine, and hydroxychloroquine are popular first-line therapies, especially for mild cutaneous disease. In more severe cases, immunosuppressives, including methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and cyclosporine, as well as corticosteroids, may be necessary for control. More recently, select biologic therapies, including rituximab, omalizumab, and interleukin-1 inhibitors have shown promise for the treatment of recalcitrant or refractory cases.	Treatment
34224994	An investigation into the beneficial effects of high-dose interferon beta 1-a, compared to low-dose interferon beta 1-a in severe COVID-19: The COVIFERON II randomized controlled trial. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a serious obstacle in front of public health. Interferon-beta 1a (IFN-beta 1a) has been used to treat patients with COVID-19. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of high-dose IFN-beta 1a compared to low dose IFN-beta 1a in severe COVID-19 cases. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, and clinical trial, eligible patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were randomly assigned to receive one of the two following therapeutic regimens: The intervention group was treated with high-dose IFN-beta 1a (Recigen) (Subcutaneous injections of 88 mug (24 million IU) on days 1, 3, 6) + lopinavir /ritonavir (Kaletra) (400 mg/100 mg twice a day for 10 days, orally) and the control group was treated with low-dose IFN-beta 1a (Recigen) (Subcutaneous injections of 44 mug (12 million IU) on days 1, 3, 6) + lopinavir /ritonavir (Kaletra) (400 mg/100 mg twice a day for 10 days, orally). RESULT: A total of 168 COVID- 19 confirmed patients underwent randomization; 83 were assigned to the intervention group and 85 were assigned to the control group. Median Time To Clinical Improvement (TTIC) for cases treated with low-dose IFN-beta1a was shorter than that for cases treated with high-dose IFN-beta1a (6 vs 10 days; P = 0.018). The mortality rates in intervention and control group were 41% and 36.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of high-dose IFN-beta 1a did not improve TTCI in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Also, it did not have any significant effect on mortality reduction compared with treating with low-dose IFN-beta 1a. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered as ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04521400.	Treatment

The goal was to improve women's PFMT during pregnancy and postpartum in La Rioja, Spain. METHODS: This evidence implementation project used the JBI evidence implementation framework. First, we conducted the PFMT baseline audit: to assess the criteria for midwife training, we sent a questionnaire to all midwives. To measure the criteria for PFMT and urinary incontinence risk assessment, we reviewed the medical records of 60 women selected through consecutive sampling and 15 other women at risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) for the inclusion criteria in a PFMT program. Second, we used the Getting Research into Practice guidelines to identify barriers to the fulfillment of each criterion and design and implement strategies to improve compliance. Finally, we repeated the audit to measure compliance and verify the changes. RESULTS: The midwives received updated PFMT, optimizing compliance with the first criterion from 67 to 100%. The remaining criteria - providing PFMT for pregnant women, identifying women at high risk of incontinence, and facilitating a supervised PFMT program for women at high risk of UTIs - went from 0% compliance to 17, 96, and 67%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This project was effective in building consensus, improving midwives' practice, and facilitating mothers' PFMT. The project continued during the novel coronavirus [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] epidemic in Spain as the midwives, women, and managers were involved in the change because of a well designed registration system and the use of online tools for communication between midwives and women.

34205865	Theophylline in Treatment of COVID-19 Induced Sinus Bradycardia. This is a retrospective case series of two patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, presented to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in January 2021. Medical records of these patients were reviewed using the EPIC electronic health record system. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were reviewed against periods of bradycardia in each patient. Both of the patients presented with dizziness and presyncope related to sinus bradycardia in which they received treatment with 1 mg of IV atropine and theophylline 200 mg orally. We share these two cases of theophylline treatment in COVID-19 induced sinus bradycardia. The first patient was a 39-year-old female, with a past medical history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, who presented to the emergency department with lightheadedness and dizziness. Two weeks prior to her presentation, she was tested positive for COVID-19 infection that was treated with azithromycin, dexamethasone and aspirin. Upon presentation, her ECG showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 48 bpm. The second patient, a 21-year-old female with no significant past medical history, presented with presyncope. Three weeks prior to her presentation, she tested positive for COVID-19 infection that was treated symptomatically at her home. Upon presentation, her ECG showed junctional rhythm at a heart rate of 51 bpm.	Case Report
34332551	COVID-19 and its effects on endothelium in HIV-positive patients in sub-Saharan Africa: Cardiometabolic risk, thrombosis and vascular function (ENDOCOVID STUDY). BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has affected almost every country in the world, especially in terms of health system capacity and economic burden. People from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) often face interaction between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease. Role of HIV infection and anti-retroviral treatment (ART) in altered cardiovascular risk is questionable and there is still need to further carry out research in this field. However, thus far it is unclear, what impact the COVID-19 co-infection in people living with HIV (PLHIV), with or without therapy will have. The ENDOCOVID project aims to investigate whether and how HIV-infection in COVID-19 patients modulates the time course of the disease, alters cardiovascular risk, and changes vascular endothelial function and coagulation parameters/ thrombosis risk. METHODS: A total of 1026 patients will be included into this study. Cardiovascular research PLHIV with (n = 114 in each of the three recruiting centers) - or without - ART (n = 114 in each of the three recruiting centers) with COVID-19 and HIV-negative with COVID-19 (n = 114 in each of the three recruiting centers) will be carried out via clinical and biochemical measurements for cardiovascular risk factors and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Vascular and endothelial function will be measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) assessments, and retinal blood vessel analyses, along with vascular endothelial biomarkers and cogualation markers. The correlation between HIV-infection in COVID-19 PLHIV with or without ART and its role in enhancement of cardiovascular risk and endothelial dysfunction will be assessed at admission, weekly, at discharge and, 4 weeks post-discharge (if possible). IMPACT OF PROJECT: The ENDOCOVID project aims to evaluate in the long-term the cardiovascular risk and vascular endothelial function in PLHIV thus revealing an important transitional cardiovascular phenotype in COVID-19. The study was registered under clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04709302).	Treatment;Diagnosis
34349633	Prevalence and Predictors of Prolonged Cognitive and Psychological Symptoms Following COVID-19 in the United States. Background/Objectives: Little is known regarding the prevalence and predictors of prolonged cognitive and psychological symptoms of COVID-19 among community-dwellers. We aimed to quantitatively measure self-reported metrics of fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and sleep and identify factors associated with these metrics among United States residents with or without COVID-19. Methods: We solicited 1000 adult United States residents for an online survey conducted February 3-5, 2021 utilizing a commercial crowdsourcing community research platform. The platform curates eligible participants to approximate United States demographics by age, sex, and race proportions. COVID-19 was diagnosed by laboratory testing and/or by exposure to a known positive contact with subsequent typical symptoms. Prolonged COVID-19 was self-reported and coded for those with symptoms >/= 1 month following initial diagnosis. The primary outcomes were NIH PROMIS/Neuro-QoL short-form T-scores for fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and sleep compared among those with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 without prolonged symptoms and COVID-19 negative subjects. Multivariable backwards step-wise logistic regression models were constructed to predict abnormal Neuro-QoL metrics. Results: Among 999 respondents, the average age was 45 years (range 18-84), 49% were male, 76 (7.6%) had a history of COVID-19 and 19/76 (25%) COVID-19 positive participants reported prolonged symptoms lasting a median of 4 months (range 1-13). Prolonged COVID-19 participants were more often younger, female, Hispanic, and had a history of depression/mood/thought disorder (all P < 0.05). They experienced significantly higher rates of unemployment and financial insecurity, and their symptoms created greater interference with work and household activities compared to other COVID-19 status groups (all P < 0.05). After adjusting for demographics, past medical history and stressor covariates in multivariable logistic regression analysis, COVID-19 status was independently predictive of worse Neuro-QoL cognitive dysfunction scores (adjusted OR 11.52, 95% CI 1.01-2.28, P = 0.047), but there were no significant differences in quantitative measures of anxiety, depression, fatigue, or sleep. Conclusion: Prolonged symptoms occurred in 25% of COVID-19 positive participants, and NeuroQoL cognitive dysfunction scores were significantly worse among COVID-19 positive subjects, even after accounting for demographic and stressor covariates. Fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep scores did not differ between COVID-19 positive and negative respondents.	Diagnosis
34200538	Interim Estimates of COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness in a Mass Vaccination Setting: Data from an Italian Province. This retrospective cohort study compared the rates of virologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic or lethal COVID-19 among the residents of the Italian province of Pescara who received one or two doses of COVID-19 vaccines, versus the unvaccinated. The official data of the National Health System were used, and a total of 69,539 vaccinated adults were compared with 175,687 unvaccinated. Among the subjects who received at least one vaccine dose, 85 infections (0.12%), 18 severe and 3 lethal COVID-19 cases were recorded after an average follow-up of 38 days. Among the unvaccinated, the numbers were 6948 (4.00%), 933 (0.53%) and 241 (0.14%), respectively. The serious adverse event reports-yet unconfirmed-were 24 out of 102,394 administered doses. In a Cox model, adjusting for age, gender, and selected comorbidities, the effectiveness of either BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or mRNA-1273 vaccines was higher than 95% in preventing infections (mostly due to B.1.1.7 variant), symptomatic or lethal COVID-19. No differences were observed across genders, and among the 691 subjects who received the second dose of vaccine later than the recommended date. Although preliminary, these findings support current immunization policies and may help reducing vaccine hesitancy.	Treatment
34352287	Aging & COVID-19 susceptibility, disease severity, and clinical outcomes: The role of entangled risk factors. The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019 has been associated with a high rate of mortality and morbidity. It has been determined that the old population are not only at an increased risk for affliction with COVID-19 infection, but also atypical presentations, severe forms of the disease, and mortality are more common in this population. A plethora of mechanisms and risk factors contribute to the higher risk of infection in the old population. For instance, aging is associated with an increment in the expression of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which precipitates replication of the virus in the old population. On the other hand, immune dysregulation and changes in gut microbiota as a result of aging can contribute to the cytokine storm, one of the main indicators of disease severity. Decrement in sex steroids, especially in women, as well as growth hormone, both of which have crucial roles in immune regulation, is a key contributor to disease severity in old age. Senescence-associated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in both pneumocytes and immune cells contribute to the severity of infection in an exacerbative manner. In addition, lifestyle-associated factors such as nutrition and physical activity, which are compromised in old age, are known as important factors in COVID-19 infection. Aging-associated comorbidities, especially cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus, also put older adults at an increased risk of complications, and disease severity.

34133199	SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 Infection of Syrian Hamster Does Not Cause More Severe Disease, and Naturally Acquired Immunity Confers Protection. Epidemiological studies have revealed the emergence of multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOC), including the lineage B.1.1.7 that is rapidly replacing old variants. The B.1.1.7 variant has been linked to increased morbidity rates, transmissibility, and potentially mortality. To assess viral fitness in vivo and to address whether the B.1.1.7 variant is capable of immune escape, we conducted infection and reinfection studies in naive and convalescent Syrian hamsters (>10 months old). Nasal wash samples from hamsters infected by a B.1.1.7 variant exhibited slightly higher viral RNA levels but lower infectious titers than those from B.1 (G614) variant-infected hamsters, and the two variants induced comparable lung pathologies in hamsters. Despite a sporadic and transient low-level infection in the nasal cavity, convalescent hamsters that had recovered from a previous USA-WA1 isolate (D614) infection displayed no observable clinical signs or lung pathology following B.1.1.7 rechallenge. Altogether, our study did not find that the B.1.1.7 variant significantly differs from the B.1 variant in pathogenicity in Syrian hamsters and that a heterologous natural infection-induced immunity confers protection against a secondary challenge by the B1.1.7 variant. IMPORTANCE The rapid emergence of several variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 calls for evaluations of viral fitness and pathogenicity in animal models in order to understand the mechanism of enhanced transmission and the possible increases in morbidity and mortality rates. Here, we demonstrated that immunity naturally acquired through a prior infection with the first-wave variant does confer nearly complete protection against the B.1.1.7 variant in Syrian hamsters upon reexposure. Strikingly, although the B.1.1.7 variant appears to replicate to a higher level in the nose than the ancestral B.1 variant, it does not induce more severe lung pathology in hamsters.

34205704	Computational Insights on the Potential of Some NSAIDs for Treating COVID-19: Priority Set and Lead Optimization. The discovery of drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 is a priority for human beings due to the severity of the global health pandemic caused by COVID-19. To this end, repurposing of FDA-approved drugs such as NSAIDs against COVID-19 can provide therapeutic alternatives that could be utilized as an effective safe treatment for COVID-19. The anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs is also advantageous in the treatment of COVID-19, as it was found that SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for provoking inflammatory cytokine storms resulting in lung damage. In this study, 40 FDA-approved NSAIDs were evaluated through molecular docking against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Among the tested compounds, sulfinpyrazone 2, indomethacin 3, and auranofin 4 were proposed as potential antagonists of COVID-19 main protease. Molecular dynamics simulations were also carried out for the most promising members of the screened NSAID candidates (2, 3, and 4) to unravel the dynamic properties of NSAIDs at the target receptor. The conducted quantum mechanical study revealed that the hybrid functional B3PW91 provides a good description of the spatial parameters of auranofin 4. Interestingly, a promising structure-activity relationship (SAR) was concluded from our study that could help in the future design of potential SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors with expected anti-inflammatory effects as well. NSAIDs may be used by medicinal chemists as lead compounds for the development of potent SARS-CoV-2 (M(pro)) inhibitors. In addition, some NSAIDs can be selectively designated for treatment of inflammation resulting from COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34341930	The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in indoor air of dental clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the indoor environment of dental clinics, dental personnel and patients are exposed to a risk of infection because of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via particles or droplets. This study investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in indoor air of dental clinics in Tehran, Iran. Air sampling was done (n = 36) collecting particulate samples on PTFE filters at flow rates of 30 to 58 L/min. The samples were analyzed with novel coronavirus nucleic acid diagnostic real-time PCR kits. Only 13 out of 36 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Logistic regression showed that sampling site's volume, PM2.5 concentration, number of people, and number of active patient treatment units were significantly positively related with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Thus, strategies to control the spread of COVID-19 should include reducing the number of infected people in dental clinics, adding filtration systems, and/or improving ventilation conditions.

34222864	Neurological and mental health consequences of COVID-19: potential implications for well-being and labour force. Recent case studies show that the SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease, COVID-19, is associated with accelerated decline of mental health, in particular, cognition in elderly individuals, but also with neurological and neuropsychiatric illness in young people. Recent studies also show a bidirectional link between COVID-19 and mental health in that people with previous history of psychiatric illness have a higher risk for contracting COVID-19 and that COVID-19 patients display a variety of psychiatric illnesses. Risk factors and the response of the central nervous system to the virus show large overlaps with pathophysiological processes associated with Alzheimer's disease, delirium, post-operative cognitive dysfunction and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, all characterized by cognitive impairment. These similarities lead to the hypothesis that the neurological symptoms could arise from neuroinflammation and immune cell dysfunction both in the periphery as well as in the central nervous system and the assumption that long-term consequences of COVID-19 may lead to cognitive impairment in the well-being of the patient and thus in today's workforce, resulting in large loss of productivity. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to neurological protection during treatment and recovery of COVID-19, while cognitive consequences may require monitoring.	Mechanism;Diagnosis
34199019	Nurse-Coordinated Blood Pressure Telemonitoring for Urban Hypertensive Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has put hypertensive patients in densely populated cities at increased risk. Nurse-coordinated home blood pressure telemonitoring (NC-HBPT) may help address this. We screened studies published in English on three databases, from their inception to 30 November 2020. The effects of NC-HBPT were compared with in-person treatment. Outcomes included changes in blood pressure (BP) following the intervention and rate of BP target achievements before and during COVID-19. Of the 1916 articles identified, 27 comparisons were included in this review. In the intervention group, reductions of 5.731 mmHg (95% confidence interval: 4.120-7.341; p < 0.001) in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 2.342 mmHg (1.482-3.202; p < 0.001) in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were identified. The rate of target BP achievement was significant in the intervention group (risk ratio, RR = 1.261, 1.154-1.378; p < 0.001). The effects of intervention over time showed an SBP reduction of 3.000 mmHg (-5.999-11.999) before 2000 and 8.755 mmHg (5.177-12.334) in 2020. DBP reduced by 2.000 mmHg (-2.724-6.724) before 2000 and by 3.529 mmHg (1.221-5.838) in 2020. Analysis of the target BP ratio before 2010 (RR = 1.101, 1.013-1.198) and in 2020 (RR = 1.906, 1.462-2.487) suggested improved BP control during the pandemic. NC-HBPT more significantly improves office blood pressure than UC among urban hypertensive patients.	Prevention
34281937	Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy sequential to SARS-CoV-2 virus pneumonia: preventable by endothelial protection? We present a case of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION) with no ocular or systemic risk factors in a patient who recovered from a recent SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. NAION is the most common acute optic neuropathy among individuals over 50 years of age. It results from a transient hypoperfusion of the optic nerve head circulation, especially in patients with low vascular compliance due to ocular or systemic risk factors. We attribute the ophthalmological condition to a SARS-CoV-2 virus-associated endotheliopathy that can be prevented with timely protection of endothelial function with vitamins D and K2.	Case Report
34352727	Evaluation of anti-cancer and anti-covid-19 properties of cationic pentapeptide Glu-Gln-Arg-Pro-Arg, from rice bran protein and its d-isomer analogs through molecular docking simulations. Bioactive peptides derived from food proteins are becoming increasingly popular due to the growing awareness of their health-promoting properties. The structure and mechanism of anti-cancer action of pentapeptide Glu-Gln-Arg-Pro-Arg (EQRPR) derived from a rice bran protein are not known. Theoretical and experimental methods were employed to fill this gap. The conformation analysis of the EQRPR pentapeptide was performed first and the obtained lowest energy conformer was optimized. The experimental structural data obtained by FTIR and CD spectroscopies agree well with the theoretical results. d-isomer introduced one-by-one to each position and all D-isomers of the peptide were also examined for its possible anti-proteolytic and activity enhancement properties. The molecular docking revealed avid binding of the pentapeptide to the integrins alpha5beta1 and alphaIIbbeta3, with Kd values of 90 nM and 180 nM, respectively. Moreover, the EQRPR and its D-isomers showed strong binding affinities to apo- and holo-forms of M(pro), spike glycoprotein, ACE2, and dACE2. The predicted results indicate that the pentapeptide may significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the peptide has the potential to be the leading molecule in the drug discovery process as having multifunctional with diverse biological activities.	Mechanism;Treatment
34372618	Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Binding and Neutralizing Antibodies in Healthcare Workers during the Epidemic Peak in Referral Hospitals and Quarantine Sites: Saudi Arabia. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population. Here, we aimed to evaluate and characterize the SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rate in randomly collected samples among HCWs from the largest referral hospitals and quarantine sites during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the city of Jeddah, the second largest city in Saudi Arabia, using a cross-sectional analytic study design. Out of 693 participants recruited from 29 June to 10 August 2020, 223 (32.2%, 95% CI: 28.8-35.8) were found to be confirmed seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and among those 197 (88.3%) had never been diagnosed with COVID-19. Seropositivity was not significantly associated with participants reporting COVID-19 compatible symptoms as most seropositive HCW participants 140 (62.8%) were asymptomatic. The large proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases detected in our study demands periodic testing as a general hospital policy.	Diagnosis
34290262	Lipid bilayer degradation induced by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as revealed by neutron reflectometry. SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins are responsible for the membrane fusion event, which allows the virus to enter the host cell and cause infection. This process starts with the binding of the spike extramembrane domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane receptor highly abundant in the lungs. In this study, the extramembrane domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (sSpike) was injected on model membranes formed by supported lipid bilayers in presence and absence of the soluble part of receptor ACE2 (sACE2), and the structural features were studied at sub-nanometer level by neutron reflection. In all cases the presence of the protein produced a remarkable degradation of the lipid bilayer. Indeed, both for membranes from synthetic and natural lipids, a significant reduction of the surface coverage was observed. Quartz crystal microbalance measurements showed that lipid extraction starts immediately after sSpike protein injection. All measurements indicate that the presence of proteins induces the removal of membrane lipids, both in the presence and in the absence of ACE2, suggesting that sSpike molecules strongly associate with lipids, and strip them away from the bilayer, via a non-specific interaction. A cooperative effect of sACE2 and sSpike on lipid extraction was also observed.	Mechanism
34217071	COVID-19 Encephalitis with SARS-CoV-2 Detected in Cerebrospinal Fluid Presenting as a Stroke Mimic. We report the case of a 35-year-old male with COVID-19 encephalitis presenting as a stroke mimic with sudden-onset expressive and receptive dysphasia, mild confusion and right arm incoordination. The patient received thrombolysis for a suspected ischaemic stroke, but later became febrile and SARS-CoV-2 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid. Electroencephalography demonstrated excess in slow waves, but neuroimaging was reported as normal. Respiratory symptoms were absent throughout and nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2. At the most recent follow-up, the patient had made a full neurological recovery. Clinicians should therefore consider testing for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF in patients who present with acute focal neurology, confusion and fever during the pandemic, even when there is no evidence of respiratory infection.

34222850	A new high-content screening assay of the entire hepatitis B virus life cycle identifies novel antivirals. Background & Aims: Chronic hepatitis B is an incurable disease. Addressing the unmet medical need for therapies has been hampered by a lack of suitable cell culture models to investigate the HBV life cycle in a single experimental setup. We sought to develop a platform suitable to investigate all aspects of the entire HBV life cycle. Methods: HepG2-NTCPsec+ cells were inoculated with HBV. Supernatants of infected cells were transferred to naive cells. Inhibition of infection was determined in primary and secondary infected cells by high-content imaging of viral and cellular factors. Novel antivirals were triaged in cells infected with cell culture- or patient-derived HBV and in stably virus replicating cells. HBV internalisation and target-based receptor binding assays were conducted. Results: We developed an HBV platform, screened 2,102 drugs and bioactives, and identified 3 early and 38 late novel HBV life cycle inhibitors using infectious HBV genotype D. Two early inhibitors, pranlukast (EC50 4.3 muM; 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC50] >50 muM) and cytochalasin D (EC50 0.07 muM; CC50 >50 muM), and 2 late inhibitors, fludarabine (EC50 0.1 muM; CC50 13.4 muM) and dexmedetomidine (EC50 6.2 muM; CC50 >50 muM), were further investigated. Pranlukast inhibited HBV preS1 binding, whereas cytochalasin D prevented the internalisation of HBV. Fludarabine inhibited the secretion of HBV progeny DNA, whereas dexmedetomidine interfered with the infectivity of HBV progeny. Patient-derived HBV genotype C was efficiently inhibited by fludarabine (EC50 0.08 muM) and dexmedetomidine (EC50 8.7 muM). Conclusions: The newly developed high-content assay is suitable to screen large-scale drug libraries, enables monitoring of the entire HBV life cycle, and discriminates between inhibition of early and late viral life cycle events. Lay summary: HBV infection is an incurable, chronic disease with few available treatments. Addressing this unmet medical need has been hampered by a lack of suitable cell culture models to study the entire viral life cycle in a single experimental setup. We developed an image-based approach suitable to screen large numbers of drugs, using a cell line that can be infected by HBV and produces large amounts of virus particles. By transferring viral supernatants from these infected cells to uninfected target cells, we could monitor the entire viral life cycle. We used this system to screen drug libraries and identified novel anti-HBV inhibitors that potently inhibit HBV in various phases of its life cycle. This assay will be an important new tool to study the HBV life cycle and accelerate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.	Mechanism;Treatment
34284754	Before the 2020 Pandemic: an observational study exploring public knowledge, attitudes, plans, and preferences towards death and end of life care in Wales. BACKGROUND: Understanding public attitudes towards death and dying is important to inform public policies around End of Life Care (EoLC). We studied the public attitudes towards death and dying in Wales. METHODS: An online survey was conducted in 2018. Social media and the HealthWiseWales platform were used to recruit participants. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. RESULTS: 2,210 people participated. Loss of independence (84%), manner of death, and leaving their beloved behind were the biggest fears around death and dying. In terms of EoLC, participants sought timely access to care (84%) and being surrounded by loved ones (62%). Being at home was less of a priority (24%). Only 50% were familiar with Advance Care Planning (ACP). A lack of standard procedures as well as of support for the execution of plans and the ability to revisit those plans hindered uptake. The taboo around death conversations, the lack of opportunities and skills to initiate discussion, and personal fear and discomfort inhibited talking about death and dying. 72% felt that we do not talk enough about death and dying and advocated normalising talking by demystifying death with a positive approach. Health professionals could initiate and support this conversation, but this depended on communication skills and manageable workload pressure. Participants encouraged a public health approach and endorsed the use of: a) social media and other public platforms, b) formal education, c) formal and legal actions, and d) signposting and access to information. CONCLUSIONS: People are ready to talk about death and dying and COVID-19 has increased awareness. A combination of top-down and bottom-up initiatives across levels and settings can increase awareness, knowledge, and service-utilisation-drivers to support health professionals and people towards shared decisions which align with people's end of life wishes and preferences.

34215803	Frequency, risk factors, and outcomes of hospital readmissions of COVID-19 patients. To determine the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who were readmitted to the hospital and the most common causes and the factors associated with readmission. Multicenter nationwide cohort study in Spain. Patients included in the study were admitted to 147 hospitals from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Readmission was defined as a new hospital admission during the 30 days after discharge. Emergency department visits after discharge were not considered readmission. During the study period 8392 patients were admitted to hospitals participating in the SEMI-COVID-19 network. 298 patients (4.2%) out of 7137 patients were readmitted after being discharged. 1541 (17.7%) died during the index admission and 35 died during hospital readmission (11.7%, p = 0.007). The median time from discharge to readmission was 7 days (IQR 3-15 days). The most frequent causes of hospital readmission were worsening of previous pneumonia (54%), bacterial infection (13%), venous thromboembolism (5%), and heart failure (5%). Age [odds ratio (OR): 1.02; 95% confident interval (95% CI): 1.01-1.03], age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index score (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.06-1.21), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.26-2.69), asthma (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.04-2.22), hemoglobin level at admission (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86-0.99), ground-glass opacification at admission (OR: 0.86; 95% CI:0.76-0.98) and glucocorticoid treatment (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.00-1.66) were independently associated with hospital readmission. The rate of readmission after hospital discharge for COVID-19 was low. Advanced age and comorbidity were associated with increased risk of readmission.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34293004	Mortality and associated risk factors of COVID-19 infection in dialysis patients in Qatar: A nationwide cohort study. CONTEXT: Patients on maintenance dialysis are more susceptible to COVID-19 and its severe form. We studied the mortality and associated risks of COVID-19 infection in dialysis patients in the state of Qatar. METHODS: This was an observational, analytical, retrospective, nationwide study. We included all adult patients on maintenance dialysis therapy who tested positive for COVID-19 (PCR assay of the nasopharyngeal swab) during the period from February 1, 2020, to July 19, 2020. Our primary outcome was to study the mortality of COVID-19 in dialysis patients in Qatar and risk factors associated with it. Our secondary objectives were to study incidence and severity of COVID-19 in dialysis patients and comparing outcomes between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. Patient demographics and clinical features were collected from a national electronic medical record. Univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate potential risk factors for mortality in our cohort. RESULTS: 76 out of 1064 dialysis patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (age 56+/-13.6, 56 hemodialysis and 20 peritoneal dialysis, 56 males). During the study period, 7.1% of all dialysis patients contracted COVID-19. Male dialysis patients had double the incidence of COVID-19 than females (9% versus 4.5% respectively; p<0.01). The most common symptoms on presentation were fever (57.9%), cough (56.6%), and shortness of breath (25%). Pneumonia was diagnosed in 72% of dialysis patients with COVID-19. High severity manifested as 25% of patients requiring admission to the intensive care unit, 18.4% had ARDS, 17.1% required mechanical ventilation, and 14.5% required inotropes. The mean length of hospital stay was 19.2 +/- -12 days. Mortality due to COVID-19 among our dialysis cohort was 15%. Univariate Cox regression analysis for risk factors associated with COVID-19-related death in dialysis patients showed significant increases in risks with age (OR 1.077, CI 95%(1.018-1.139), p = 0.01), CHF and COPD (both same OR 8.974, CI 95% (1.039-77.5), p = 0.046), history of DVT (OR 5.762, CI 95% (1.227-27.057), p = 0.026), Atrial fibrillation (OR 7.285, CI 95%(2.029-26.150), p = 0.002), hypoxia (OR: 16.6; CI 95%(3.574-77.715), p = <0.001), ICU admission (HR30.8, CI 95% (3.9-241.2), p = 0.001), Mechanical ventilation (HR 50.07 CI 95% (6.4-391.2)), p<0.001) and using inotropes(HR 19.17, CI 95% (11.57-718.5), p<0.001). In a multivariate analysis, only ICU admission was found to be significantly associated with death [OR = 32.8 (3.5-305.4), p = 0.002)]. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to be conducted at a national level in Qatar exploring COVID-19 in a dialysis population. Dialysis patients had a high incidence of COVID-19 infection and related mortality compared to previous reports of the general population in the state of Qatar (7.1% versus 4% and 15% versus 0.15% respectively). We also observed a strong association between death related to COVID-19 infection in dialysis patients and admission to ICU.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34282699	"New-graduate physiotherapists' training needs and readiness for telehealth. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid transition to telehealth for the delivery of many Australian physiotherapy services. Little is known about new-graduate training needs in this method of service delivery.Aim. To explore the readiness and specific training needs of new-graduate physiotherapists for telehealth service delivery in Australia. METHODS: Qualitative individual telephone interviews of new-graduate physiotherapists (n = 16) and two videoconference focus groups of supervisors of new-graduate physiotherapists (n = 7) were undertaken. Thematic analysis was used. RESULTS: Two global themes each with three organizing themes were generated. The two global themes were ""support needs for novice practitioners"" and ""how to best prepare for telehealth."" DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: New-graduate physiotherapists and supervisors perceive that pre-professional exposure to, and practical skills training for, telehealth is essential. Elements such as undertaking physical assessments via telehealth, verbal communication, and effective clinical reasoning in telehealth assessment and treatment were highlighted as areas of need. Both stakeholder groups perceived that the rapid transition to telehealth challenged the self-efficacy of new-graduates as they did not have clinical experience to rely on. The preparation, and ongoing support of new-graduates to adopt telehealth in the workplace is considered critical given the shift in Australian healthcare to online platforms."	Prevention
34215560	Clinical manifestations and socio-demographic status of COVID-19 patients during the second-wave of pandemic: A Bangladeshi experience. BACKGROUND: Bangladesh is a densely populated country with a substandard healthcare system and a mediocre economic framework. Due to the enormous number of people who have been unaware until now, the development of COVID-19's second-wave infection has become a severe threat. The present investigation aimed to characterize the clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out from all the other COVID-19 patients and confirmed by RT-PCR undergoing a specialized COVID-19 hospital. From March 1 to April 15, 2021, a total of 1326 samples were collected. Samples were only obtained from non-critical COVID-19 patients as critically ill patients required emergency intensive care medications. Then, from April 17 to May 03, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical assessment was performed based on interim guidelines from the WHO. The diagnosis was conducted through RT-PCR. Later, identifying the symptomatic and asymptomatic patient based on checking the Clinical Observation Form (COF). The patients filled the COF form. Finally, statistical analyses were done using the SPSS 20 statistical program. RESULTS: In this investigation, a total of 326 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive. Among them, approximately 19.02% (n = 62) were asymptomatic, and 80.98% (n = 264) were symptomatic. Here, the finding shows that the occurrence of this infection was varied depending on age, sex, residence, occupation, smoking habit, comorbidities, etc. However, Males (60.12%) were more affected than females (39.88%), and, surprisingly, this pandemic infected both urban and rural residents almost equally (urban = 50.92%; rural = 49.08%). Approximately 19% of the asymptomatic and 62% of symptomatic cases had at least one comorbid disorder. Interestingly, an unexpected result was exhibited in the case of smokers, where non-smokers were more affected than smokers. The study indicates community transmission of COVID 19, where people were highly infected at their occupations (35.58%), at houses (23.93%) and by traveling (12.88%). Noteworthy, according to this report, a large number (19.33%) of individuals did not know exactly how they were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were most commonly treated by an antibiotic 95.09%, followed in second by corticosteroid 46.01%. Anti-viral drugs, remdesivir, and oxygenation are also needed for other patients. Among those, who were being treated, approximately 69.33% were isolated at home, 27.91% were being treated at dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. Finally, 96.63% were discharged without complications, and 0.03% has died. CONCLUSION: This investigation concludes that males became more infected than females. Interestingly, both urban and rural people became nearly equally infected. It noticed community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, where people were highly infected at their workplaces. A higher rate of silent transmission indicates that more caution is needed to identify asymptomatic patients. Most of the infected people were isolated at home whereas nearly one-fourth were treated at hospitals. Clinically, antibiotics were the most widely used treatment. However, the majority of the patients were discharged without complications. The current investigation would be helpful to understand the clinical manifestations and socio-demographic situations during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.

34293703	"Characteristics and predictors for silent hypoxemia in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: An intriguing feature recently unveiled in some COVID-19 patients is the ""silent hypoxemia"" phenomenon, which refers to the discrepancy of subjective well-being sensation while suffering hypoxia, manifested as the absence of dyspnea. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and predictors of silent hypoxemia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study including consecutive hospitalized adult (>/= 18 years) patients with confirmed COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department with oxygen saturation (SpO2) </= 80% on room air from March 15 to June 30, 2020. We analyzed the characteristics, disease severity, and in-hospital outcomes of patients presenting with dyspnea and those without dyspnea (silent hypoxemia). RESULTS: We studied 470 cases (64.4% men; median age 55 years, interquartile range 46-64). There were 447 (95.1%) patients with dyspnea and 23 (4.9%) with silent hypoxemia. The demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory and imaging findings, disease severity, and outcomes were similar between groups. Higher breathing and heart rates correlated significantly with lower SpO2 in patients with dyspnea but not in those with silent hypoxemia. Independent predictors of silent hypoxemia were the presence of new-onset headache (OR 2.919, 95% CI 1.101-7.742; P = 0.031) and presenting to the emergency department within the first eight days after symptoms onset (OR 3.183, 95% CI 1.024-9.89; P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with silent hypoxemia sought medical attention earlier and had new-onset headache more often. They were also likely to display lower hemodynamic compensatory responses to hypoxemia, which may underestimate the disease severity."	Diagnosis;Treatment
34344032	"Persistierende Beschwerden nach akuter COVID-19-Erkrankung: ""Long-COVID""? Some patients complain of persisting symptoms after acute COVID-19. There is no universal definition yet for these post-acute sequelae, also termed Long COVID. Although their prevalence remains to be established, a delayed recovery seems to be more common than after other acute infectious diseases. Common complaints include fatigue with exercise intolerance, dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Female sex, comorbidities, and severity of the acute disease have been identified as risk factors for persisting symptoms. It is, however, important to highlight that they are not limited to patients after severe COVID-19. Whilst their pathogenesis and prognosis is largely unknown, diagnostic evaluation should focus on exclusion of objective organ dysfunctions. Due to the variable presentation, management is interdisciplinary and may include physiotherapy, rehabilitation programmes, and psychological support. This article aims to summarize the current - limited - evidence on persisting symptoms after COVID-19."	Diagnosis;Treatment
34221726	Discrete simulation analysis of COVID-19 and prediction of isolation bed numbers. Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 has been defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, and containment depends on traditional public health measures. However, the explosive growth of the number of infected cases in a short period of time has caused tremendous pressure on medical systems. Adequate isolation facilities are essential to control outbreaks, so this study aims to quickly estimate the demand and number of isolation beds. Methods: We established a discrete simulation model for epidemiology. By adjusting or fitting necessary epidemic parameters, the effects of the following indicators on the development of the epidemic and the occupation of medical resources were explained: (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease healing time, and (4) population mobility. Finally, a method for predicting the number of isolation beds was summarized through multiple linear regression. This is a city level model that simulates the epidemic situation from the perspective of population mobility. Results: Through simulation, we show that the incubation period, response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, disease healing time, degree of population mobility, and infectivity of cured patients have different effects on the infectivity, scale, and duration of the epidemic. Among them, (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease healing time, and (4) population mobility have a significant impact on the demand and number of isolation beds (P <0.05), which agrees with the following regression equation: N = P x (-0.273 + 0.009I + 0.234M + 0.012T1 + 0.015T2) x (1 + V).

34218365	Diagnostic performance of chest radiography in high COVID-19 prevalence setting: experience from a European reference hospital. PURPOSE: The study's aim is to analyse the diagnostic performance of chest radiography (CXR) in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). METHODS: We retrospectively considered 826 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 presenting to our emergency department (ED) from February 21 to March 31, 2020, in a high disease prevalence setting. We enrolled patients who underwent CXR and rhino-oropharyngeal swab for real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). CXRs were evaluated by an expert radiologist; a second independent analysis was performed by two residents in consensus. All readers, blinded to rRT-PCR results, classified CXRs positive/negative depending on presence/absence of typical findings of COVID-19, using rRT-PCR as reference standard. RESULTS: We finally analysed 680 patients (median age 58); 547 (80%) tested positive for COVID-19. The diagnostic performance of CXR, interpreted by the expert reader, was as follows: sensitivity (79.0%; 95% CI: 75.3-82.3), specificity (81.2%; 95% CI: 73.5-87.5), PPV (94.5%;95% CI: 92.0-96.4), NPV (48.4%; 95% CI: 41.7-55.2), and accuracy (79.3%; 95% CI: 76.0-82.2). For the residents: sensitivity (75.1%; 95% CI: 71.2-78.7), specificity (57.9%; 95% CI: 49.9-66.4), PPV (88.0%; 95% CI: 84.7-90.8), NPV (36.2%; 95% CI: 29.7-43.0), and accuracy (71.6%; 95% CI: 68.1-75.0). We found a significant difference between the reporting sensitivity (p = 0.013) and specificity (p < 0.0001) of expert radiologist vs residents. CXR sensitivity was higher in patients with symptom onset > 5 days before ED presentation compared to </= 5 days (84.4% vs 70.7%). CONCLUSIONS: CXR showed a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 81% in diagnosing viral pneumonia in symptomatic patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19. Further studies in lower prevalence settings are needed.	Diagnosis
34224024	"Reactivation of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease under control for more than 6 years, following anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is a primary stromal choroiditis with bilateral granulomatous panuveitis. If initial-onset VKH is treated early and relentlessly the disease can be controlled and even ""cured"" in a substantial number of cases. We are reporting on a patient treated early and in a sustained fashion who was inflammation free for seven years but who presented a reactivation 6 weeks after the second dose of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old woman presented with severe initial-onset VKH disease which was brought under control using steroidal and non-steroidal Immunosuppression (mycophenolic acid and cyclosporine) with additional infliximab infusions because of the persistence of subclinical choroiditis identified on ICGA. Under infliximab alone disease had been inflammation free with no subclinical disease and absence of sunset glow fundus for 6 years. However, following anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, severe resurgence of the disease occurred with exudative retinal detachments. Disease was rapidly brought again under control with oral prednisone (1 mg/kg) therapy and a new loading scheme of infliximab therapy. CONCLUSION: VKH disease results from an autoimmune process directed against melanocyte associated antigens which can be controlled when early and sustained immunosuppressive treatment is introduced. It seems that anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can be at the origin of reactivation of long-time controlled disease."	Case Report
34225090	Characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 infection in 45 patients with breast cancer: A multi-center retrospective study in Hubei, China. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant worldwide health crisis. Breast cancer patients with COVID-19 are fragile and require particular clinical care. This study aimed to identify the clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients with COVID-19 and the risks associated with anti-cancer treatment. METHODS: The medical records of breast cancer patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were collected among 9559 COVID-19 patients from seven designated hospitals from 13th January to 18th March 2020 in Hubei, China. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess risk factors for COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: Of the 45 breast cancer patients with COVID-19, 33 (73.3%) developed non-severe COVID-19, while 12 (26.7%) developed severe COVID-19, of which 3 (6.7%) patients died. The median age was 62 years, and 3 (6.7%) patients had stage IV breast cancer. Univariate analysis showed that age over 75 and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score were associated with COVID-19 disease severity (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that patients who received chemotherapy within 7 days had a significantly higher risk for severe COVID-19 (logistic regression model: RR = 13.886, 95% CI 1.014-190.243, P = 0.049; Cox proportional hazards model: HR = 13.909, 95% CI 1.086-178.150, P = 0.043), with more pronounced neutropenia and higher LDH, CRP and procalcitonin levels than other patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In our breast cancer cohort, the severity of COVID-19 could be associated with baseline factors such as age over 75 and ECOG scores. Chemotherapy within 7 days before symptom onset could be a risk factor for severe COVID-19, reflected by neutropenia and elevated LDH, CRP and procalcitonin levels.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34376474	Acute medical units during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-national exploratory study of impact and responses. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the greatest ever challenges for healthcare. In the UK and beyond, acute medical units (AMUs) are the first point of assessment and care for the majority of medical inpatients. By their design and systems, they inevitably played an important role in the COVID-19 response but to date little has been published on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected how AMUs have reorganised their resources, processes and structure. METHODS: This retrospective study in August 2020 of 10 AMUs across Europe and Australasia used a standardised questionnaire to investigate existing practice and structure of AMUs, the national context of local hospital experience, changes to practice during the COVID-19 pandemic and views regarding future practice. RESULTS: Changes to AMU structure, process and organisation are described in two contexts: preventing and controlling the spread of COVID-19 and adding value to the patient's acute care journey in the local context. We describe novel practices that have arisen and highlight areas of concern. CONCLUSIONS: The AMUs were able to adapt to meet the demands of acute care delivery during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Operational planning and prioritisation of resources must be optimised to ensure sustainability of these services for future waves.	Prevention
34347879	A case-control study on the association between periodontitis and coronavirus disease (COVID-19). BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and periodontitis share common characteristics, such as an exaggerated inflammatory response. As periodontal diseases were shown to be associated with respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia, it is quite possible that a relationship may exist between periodontitis and COVID-19. Hence, the aim of the present study was to determine whether periodontitis and poor oral hygiene are associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A case control study was conducted. Patients who had positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were included in the case group (n = 79), and patients with negative results were included in the control group (n = 71). The periodontal examination involved recording the plaque scores, calculus scores, tooth mobility, gingival bleeding, probing depth, recession, and clinical attachment level (CAL). RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed significant associations of mean plaque scores >/= 1 (odds ratio (OR), 7.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.83-26.94), gingivitis (OR, 17.65; 95% CI, 5.95-52.37), mean CAL >/= 2 mm (OR, 8.46; 95% CI, 3.47-20.63), and severe periodontitis (OR, 11.75; 95% CI, 3.89-35.49) with COVID-19; these findings were more prevalent in the case group. CONCLUSION: Based on the abovementioned observations, it can be concluded that there is an association between periodontitis severity and COVID-19. Gingival bleeding and dental plaque accumulation are also more frequent among COVID-19 patients. Hence, it is essential to maintain periodontal health and good oral hygiene as an important measure for COVID-19 prevention and management. This article is protected by copyright.

34284707	"COVID-19: Myths and Reality. COVID-19, a new human respiratory disease that has killed nearly 3 million people in a year since the start of the pandemic, is a global public health challenge. Its infectious agent, SARS-CoV-2, differs from other coronaviruses in a number of structural features that make this virus more pathogenic and transmissible. In this review, we discuss some important characteristics of the main SARS-CoV-2 surface antigen, the spike (S) protein, such as (i) ability of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) to switch between the ""standing-up"" position (open pre-fusion conformation) for receptor binding and the ""lying-down"" position (closed pre-fusion conformation) for immune system evasion; (ii) advantage of a high binding affinity of the RBD open conformation to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for efficient cell entry; and (iii) S protein preliminary activation by the intracellular furin-like proteases for facilitation of the virus spreading across different cell types. We describe interactions between the S protein and cellular receptors, co-receptors, and antagonists, as well as a hypothetical mechanism of the homotrimeric spike structure destabilization that triggers the fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane at physiological pH and mediates the viral nucleocapsid entry into the cytoplasm. The transition of the S protein pre-fusion conformation to the post-fusion one on the surface of virions after their treatment with some reagents, such as beta-propiolactone, is essential, especially in relation to the vaccine production. We also compare the COVID-19 pathogenesis with that of severe outbreaks of ""avian"" influenza caused by the A/H5 and A/H7 highly pathogenic viruses and discuss the structural similarities between the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and hemagglutinins of those highly pathogenic strains. Finally, we touch on the prospective and currently used COVID-19 antiviral and anti-pathogenetic therapeutics, as well as recently approved conventional and innovative COVID-19 vaccines and their molecular and immunological features."

34216091	Multi-institution consensus paper for acquisition of portable chest radiographs through glass barriers. BACKGROUND: To conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and reduce exposure to potentially infected COVID-19 patients, several Californian facilities independently implemented a method of acquiring portable chest radiographs through glass barriers that was originally developed by the University of Washington. METHODS: This work quantifies the transmission of radiation through a glass barrier using six radiographic systems at five facilities. Patient entrance air kerma (EAK) and effective dose were estimated both with and without the glass barrier. Beam penetrability and resulting exposure index (EI) and deviation index (DI) were measured and used to adjust the tube current-time product (mAs) for glass barriers. Because of beam hardening, the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was measured with image quality phantoms to ensure diagnostic integrity. Finally, scatter surveys were performed to assess staff radiation exposure both inside and outside the exam room. RESULTS: The glass barriers attenuated a mean of 61% of the normal X-ray beams. When the mAs was increased to match EI values, there was no discernible degradation of image quality as determined by the CNR. This was corroborated with subjective assessments of image quality by chest radiologists. The glass-hardened beams acted as a filter for low energy X-rays, and some facilities observed slight changes in patient effective doses. There was scattering from both the phantoms and the glass barriers within the room. CONCLUSIONS: Glass barriers require an approximate 2.5 times increase in beam intensity, with all other technique factors held constant. Further refinements are necessary for increased source-to-image distance and beam quality in order to adequately match EI values. This does not result in a significant increase in the radiation dose delivered to the patient. The use of lead aprons, mobile shields, and increased distance from scattering sources should be employed where practicable in order to keep staff radiation doses as low as reasonably achievable.

34293476	CoVrimer: A tool for aligning SARS-CoV-2 primer sequences and selection of conserved/degenerate primers. As mutations in SARS-CoV-2 virus accumulate rapidly, novel primers that amplify this virus sensitively and specifically are in demand. We have developed a webserver named CoVrimer by which users can search for and align existing or newly designed conserved/degenerate primer pair sequences against the viral genome and assess the mutation load of both primers and amplicons. CoVrimer uses mutation data obtained from an online platform established by NGDC-CNCB (12 May 2021) to identify genomic regions, either conserved or with low levels of mutations, from which potential primer pairs are designed and provided to the user for filtering based on generalized and SARS-CoV-2 specific parameters. Alignments of primers and probes can be visualized with respect to the reference genome, indicating variant details and the level of conservation. Consequently, CoVrimer is likely to help researchers with the challenges posed by viral evolution and is freely available at http://konulabapps.bilkent.edu.tr:3838/CoVrimer/.	Mechanism
34361998	"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies and Factors Associated with Seropositivity at the University of Salamanca: The DIANCUSAL Study. BACKGROUND: Systematic screening for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial tool for surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The University of Salamanca (USAL) in Spain designed a project called ""DIANCUSAL"" (Diagnosis of New Coronavirus, COVID-19, in University of Salamanca) to measure antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among its ~34,000 students and academic staff, as the influence of the university community in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the city of Salamanca and neighboring towns hosting USAL campuses could be substantial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among USAL students, professors and staff and to evaluate the demographic, academic, clinical and lifestyle and behavioral factors related to seropositivity. METHODOLOGY: The DIANCUSAL study is an ongoing university population-based cross-sectional study, with the work described herein conducted from July-October 2020. All USAL students, professors and staff were invited to complete an anonymized questionnaire. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was detected and quantified by using chemiluminescent assays for IgG and IgM. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 8197 (24.71%) participants were included. The mean age was 31.4 (14.5 SD) years, and 66.0% of the participants were female. The seroprevalence was 8.25% overall and was highest for students from the education campus (12.5%) and professors from the biomedical campus (12.6%), with significant differences among faculties (p = 0.006). Based on the questionnaire, loss of smell and fever were the symptoms most strongly associated with seropositivity, and 22.6% of seropositive participants were asymptomatic. Social distancing was the most effective hygiene measure (p = 0.0007). There were significant differences in seroprevalence between participants with and without household exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (p = 0.0000), but not between students who lived in private homes and those who lived in dormitories. IgG antibodies decreased over time in the participants with confirmed self-reported COVID-19 diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis revealed an overall 8.25% seroprevalence at the end of October 2020, with a higher seroprevalence in students than in staff. Thus, there is no need for tailored measures for the USAL community as the official average seroprevalence in the area was similar (7.8% at 22 June and 12.4 at 15 November of 2020). Instead, USAL members should comply with public health measures."	Diagnosis;Prevention
34339563	Neuropathological findings from COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms argue against a direct brain invasion of SARS-CoV-2: a critical systematic review. BACKGROUND: Neuropathological studies can elucidate the mechanisms of nervous system damage associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite literature on this topic is rapidly expanding, correlations between neurological symptoms and brain pathology findings in COVID-19 patients remain largely unknown. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review on neuropathological studies in COVID-19, including 438 patients from 45 papers published by April 22, 2021. We retrieved quantitative data regarding demographic, clinical and neuropathological findings. We carried out Wilcoxon rank-sum test or chi-square test to compare patients' subgroups based on different clinical and brain pathology features. RESULTS: Neuropathological findings in COVID-19 patients were microgliosis (52.5%), astrogliosis (45.6%), inflammatory infiltrates (44.0%), hypoxic-ischemic lesions (40.8%), edema (25.3%), and hemorrhagic lesions (20.5%). SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins were identified in brain specimens of 41.9% and 28.3% of subjects, respectively. Detailed clinical information was available from 245 patients (55.9%), and among them 96 subjects (39.2%) had presented with neurological symptoms in association with typical COVID-19 manifestations. We found that: i) detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins in brain specimens did not differ between patients with vs. those without neurological symptoms; ii) brain edema, hypoxic-ischemic lesions, and inflammatory infiltrates were more frequent in subjects with neurological impairment; iii) neurological symptoms were more common among older individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic revision of clinical correlates in COVID-19 highlights the pathogenic relevance of brain inflammatory reaction and hypoxic-ischemic damage rather than neuronal viral load. This analysis indicates that a more focused study design is needed, especially in the perspective of potential therapeutic trials.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
34207476	Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans in Viral Infection and Treatment: A Special Focus on SARS-CoV-2. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) encompass a group of glycoproteins composed of unbranched negatively charged heparan sulfate (HS) chains covalently attached to a core protein. The complex HSPG biosynthetic machinery generates an extraordinary structural variety of HS chains that enable them to bind a plethora of ligands, including growth factors, morphogens, cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, matrix proteins, and bacterial and viral pathogens. These interactions translate into key regulatory activity of HSPGs on a wide range of cellular processes such as receptor activation and signaling, cytoskeleton assembly, extracellular matrix remodeling, endocytosis, cell-cell crosstalk, and others. Due to their ubiquitous expression within tissues and their large functional repertoire, HSPGs are involved in many physiopathological processes; thus, they have emerged as valuable targets for the therapy of many human diseases. Among their functions, HSPGs assist many viruses in invading host cells at various steps of their life cycle. Viruses utilize HSPGs for the attachment to the host cell, internalization, intracellular trafficking, egress, and spread. Recently, HSPG involvement in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been established. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying HSPG/SARS-CoV-2 interaction and downstream effects, and we provide an overview of the HSPG-based therapeutic strategies that could be used to combat such a fearsome virus.

AIMS: The majority of studies report that the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown did not have a detrimental effect on glycaemia. We sought to explore the impact of lockdown on glycaemia and whether this is sustained following easing of restrictions. METHODS: Retrospective, observational analysis in adults and children with type 1 diabetes attending a UK specialist centre, using real-time or intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring. Data from the following 28-day time periods were collected: (i) pre-lockdown; (ii) during lockdown; (iii) immediately after lockdown; and (iv) a month following relaxation of restrictions (coinciding with Government-subsidised restaurant food). Data were analysed for times in glycaemic ranges and are expressed as median (IQR). RESULTS: 145 adults aged 35.5 (25.8-51.3) years with diabetes duration of 19.0 (7.0-29.0) years on multiple daily injections of insulin (60%) and continuous insulin infusion (40%) were included. In adults, % time in range (70-180mg/dL) increased during lockdown (60.2 (45.2-69.3)%) compared to pre-lockdown (56.7 (43.5-65.3)%; p<0.001). This was maintained in the post-lockdown time periods. Similarly, % time above range (>180mg/dL) reduced in lockdown compared to pre-lockdown (p = 0.01), which was sustained thereafter. In children, no significant changes to glycaemia were observed during lockdown. In multivariable analysis, a greater increase in %TIR 3.9-10mmol/L (70-180mg/dL) during lockdown was associated with higher levels of deprivation (coefficient: 4.208, 95% CI 0.588 to 7.828; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Glycaemia in adults improved during lockdown, with people from more deprived areas most likely to benefit. This effect was sustained after easing of restrictions, with government-subsidised restaurant eating having no adverse impact on glycaemia."	Prevention
34200837	Combination of rRT-PCR and Anti-Nucleocapsid/Anti-Spike Antibodies to Characterize Specimens with Very Low Viral SARs-CoV-2 Load: A Real-Life Experience. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the true positivity among people, whose results of initial testing of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) showed a very low viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Seventy-seven people detected with low viral loads of SARs-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples (Ct >/= 35) were enrolled in the study. For this purpose, a second NPS was collected for rRT-PCR (real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) combined with a pair of serum samples for detection of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) and anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies. In 8 people, subsequent examinations indicated an increase in viral loads, thereafter, followed by an increase of anti-N and anti-S antibodies, findings compatible with an early stage of COVID-19 infection. In 9 people, who already had increased anti-N antibodies, subsequent examination showed a decrease or absence of viral load and an increase in antibodies, indicative of a late stage of COVID-19 infection. In 60 people, subsequent examination showed absence of infection (as indicated by absence of viral load and antibodies). We propose that the combination of a second NPS and one serum-specimen, both taken three days after the first NPS, helps significantly to avoid false-positive results.	Diagnosis
34213740	Lung ultrasound findings in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to venous thromboembolic events: the ECHOVID-19 study. PURPOSE: Several studies have reported thromboembolic events to be common in severe COVID-19 cases. We sought to investigate the relationship between lung ultrasound (LUS) findings in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the development of venous thromboembolic events (VTE). METHODS: A total of 203 adults were included from a COVID-19 ward in this prospective multi-center study (mean age 68.6 years, 56.7% men). All patients underwent 8-zone LUS, and all ultrasound images were analyzed off-line blinded. Several LUS findings were investigated (total number of B-lines, B-line score, and LUS-scores). RESULTS: Median time from admission to LUS examination was 4 days (IQR: 2, 8). The median number of B-lines was 12 (IQR: 8, 18), and 44 (21.7%) had a positive B-line score. During hospitalization, 17 patients developed VTE (4 deep-vein thrombosis, 15 pulmonary embolism), 12 following and 5 prior to LUS. In fully adjusted multivariable Cox models (excluding participants with VTE prior to LUS), all LUS parameters were significantly associated with VTE (total number of B-lines: HR = 1.14, 95% CI (1.03, 1.26) per 1 B-line increase), positive B-line score: HR = 9.79, 95% CI (1.87, 51.35), and LUS-score: HR = 1.51, 95% CI (1.10, 2.07), per 1-point increase). The B-line score and LUS-score remained significantly associated with VTE in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, pathological LUS findings were common, and the total number of B-lines, B-line score, and LUS-score were all associated with VTE. These findings indicate that the LUS examination may be useful in risk stratification and the clinical management of COVID-19. These findings should be considered hypothesis generating.

34200390	Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Lifestyles of Health Sciences University Students in Spain: A Longitudinal Study. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted daily activities worldwide. University students may have experienced substantial changes in daily living as a result of restrictions on university attendance. The return to normalcy may take a long time, and understanding the influence that shifts in daily routines have had on the lifestyles of university students may inform approaches to support overall well-being. We analyzed changes in the lifestyles of students enrolled at a health sciences university during the COVID-19 pandemic. This longitudinal study took place at the Faculty of Medicine and Nursing in the University of the Basque Country in Spain, and the final sample consisted of 113 nursing students, 109 medical students, and 45 physiotherapy students. Our results demonstrate changes in lifestyles of university students during the pandemic. MedDiet adherence scores and the percentage of students with high adherence increased during the pandemic. This increase was due to the increased consumption of vegetables and nuts. In terms of physical activity, the practice of moderate and intense physical activity was maintained. These results provide important information for both public health authorities and educational institutions to guide strategies to maintain the well-being of students and enhance opportunities for young adults to lead a healthy lifestyle.

34356569	Family Presence Restrictions and Telemedicine Use in Neonatal Intensive Care Units during the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic. We aimed to describe parental presence policy and telemedicine use in Japanese neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) before and during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This cross-sectional study was performed through an online survey in 110 level III units from 19 November 2020 to 18 December 2020. Nurses' evaluation of the current situation (during COVID-19) was compared with their retrospective pre-COVID-19 (December 2019) evaluation. Responses were received from 52 NICUs distributed across all regions in Japan. The median allowed parental presence time decreased from 12 h to 1 h, and 29 NICUs allowed entry of parents simultaneously during COVID-19. There was an increase in the number of units providing telemedicine through telephone and online visits during COVID-19 compared to that before COVID-19 (from 2% to 19%). The hybrid design NICUs, with 11-89% of beds in single-patient rooms, allowed a longer parental presence time in the NICUs than those with >/=90% of beds in multi-bed rooms. The number of units implementing kangaroo care decreased during COVID-19 compared to that before COVID-19. The need for telemedicine increased among Japanese NICUs to mitigate the adverse effect of parental restriction and limited physical contact due to the COVID-19 pandemic.	Prevention
34289058	Inter-subject variation in ACE2 protein expression in human airway epithelia and its relationship to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 initiates entry into airway epithelia by binding its receptor, ACE2. To explore whether inter-individual variation in ACE2 abundance contributes to variability in COVID-19 outcomes, we measured ACE2 protein abundance in primary airway epithelial cultures derived from 58 human donor lungs. We found no evidence for sex- or age-dependent differences in ACE2 protein expression. Further, we found that variations in ACE2 abundance had minimal effects on viral replication and induction of the interferon response in airway epithelia infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our results highlight the relative importance of additional host factors, beyond viral receptor expression, in determining COVID-19 lung disease outcomes.	Mechanism
34365935	Clinical Efficacy of Remdesivir and Favipiravir in the Treatment of Covid-19 Patients: Scenario So Far. The novel SARS-CoV-2 is a new disease that has caused severe destruction to human lives across the globe, including infection, mortality and financial crises, for which, scientific researchers have been directed towards the development of treatment and controlling measures against coronavirus. Currently, there has been no approved drug for the treatment of the disease, but several antiviral drugs have shown therapeutic effects from which, remdesivir and favipiravir are two such drugs. These drugs have shown some therapeutic potential in the treatment of COVID-19 by inhibiting viral enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The purpose of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the effectiveness of these two drugs based on the clinical trials reported in current published data.	Treatment
34131140	Identification of pyrogallol as a warhead in design of covalent inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease. The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) urgently needs an effective cure. 3CL protease (3CL(pro)) is a highly conserved cysteine proteinase that is indispensable for coronavirus replication, providing an attractive target for developing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Here we describe the discovery of myricetin, a flavonoid found in many food sources, as a non-peptidomimetic and covalent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro). Crystal structures of the protease bound with myricetin and its derivatives unexpectedly revealed that the pyrogallol group worked as an electrophile to covalently modify the catalytic cysteine. Kinetic and selectivity characterization together with theoretical calculations comprehensively illustrated the covalent binding mechanism of myricetin with the protease and demonstrated that the pyrogallol can serve as an electrophile warhead. Structure-based optimization of myricetin led to the discovery of derivatives with good antiviral activity and the potential of oral administration. These results provide detailed mechanistic insights into the covalent mode of action by pyrogallol-containing natural products and a template for design of non-peptidomimetic covalent inhibitors against 3CL(pro)s, highlighting the potential of pyrogallol as an alternative warhead in design of targeted covalent ligands.

34131332	100 years of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy: from cattle to COVID-19. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the most widely used vaccine worldwide and has been used to prevent tuberculosis for a century. BCG also stimulates an anti-tumour immune response, which urologists have harnessed for the treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. A growing body of evidence indicates that BCG offers protection against various non-mycobacterial and viral infections. The non-specific effects of BCG occur via the induction of trained immunity and form the basis for the hypothesis that BCG vaccination could be used to protect against the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This Perspective article highlights key milestones in the 100-year history of BCG and projects its potential role in the COVID-19 pandemic.	Treatment
34222306	Effects of the Mediterranean Lifestyle During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Spain: Preliminary Study. We aim to assess the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean style-diet before and after the period of confinement due to COVID-19 in a sample of 51 older patients who were part of a clinical trial of the Instituto de Investigacion sanitaria y Biomedica de Alicante (ISABIAL, CEIM). Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: experimental vs. a control group. A pre-test survey assessment was conducted before confinement, while a post-test survey was conducted after the confinement period. Adherence to Mediterranean Diet and nutritional status were evaluated through self-reported questionnaires. Individuals who initiated the Mediterranean Diet intervention program before confinement increased 3.5% their level of adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and maintained their nutritional status after the confinement. In the case of BMI, there no were statistically significant differences between groups before and after confinement. These results suggest that adherence to the Mediterranean Diet may play an important role in the establishment of appropriate dietary guidelines in confinement situations such as the COVID-19.

34226795	COVSeg-NET: A deep convolution neural network for COVID-19 lung CT image segmentation. COVID-19 is a new type of respiratory infectious disease that poses a serious threat to the survival of human beings all over the world. Using artificial intelligence technology to analyze lung images of COVID-19 patients can achieve rapid and effective detection. This study proposes a COVSeg-NET model that can accurately segment ground glass opaque lesions in COVID-19 lung CT images. The COVSeg-NET model is based on the fully convolutional neural network model structure, which mainly includes convolutional layer, nonlinear unit activation function, maximum pooling layer, batch normalization layer, merge layer, flattening layer, sigmoid layer, and so forth. Through experiments and evaluation results, it can be seen that the dice coefficient, sensitivity, and specificity of the COVSeg-NET model are 0.561, 0.447, and 0.996 respectively, which are more advanced than other deep learning methods. The COVSeg-NET model can use a smaller training set and shorter test time to obtain better segmentation results.	Diagnosis
34221722	Continued nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 following discharge of patients with COVID-19 in Lu'an, China. Background: Studies have shown that discharged Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have retested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during a follow-up RT-PCR test. We sought to assess the results of continued nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 patients in COVID-19 patients after they were discharged in Lu'an, China. Methods: We conducted RT-PCR tests on sputum, throat swabs, fecal or anal swabs, and urine samples collected from 67 COVID-19 patients following discharge. Samples were collected on the 7th and 14th days following discharge. Patients testing positive on the 7th or 14th day were retested after 24 hours until they tested negative twice. Results: Seventeen (17/67, 25.4%) discharged COVID-19 patients had a positive RT-PCR retest for SARS-CoV-2. Among them, 14 (82.4%) were sputum positive, five (29.4%) were throat swab positive, seven (41.2%) were fecal or anal swab positive, one (5.9%) was urine sample positive, five (29.4%) were both sputum and throat swab positive, four (23.5%) were both sputum and fecal test positive, and one (5.9%) was positive of all four specimens. The shortest period of time between discharge and the last positive test was 7 days, the longest was 48 days, and the median was 16 days. The proportion of positive fecal or anal swab tests increased from the third week. The median Cq cut-off values after onset were 26.7 after the first week, 37.7 the second to sixth week, and 40 after the sixth week. There were no significant differences between the RT-PCR retest positive group and the unrecovered positive group. Conclusions: There was a high proportion of patients who retested positive for COVID-19. Discharge criteria have remained fairly consistent so we encourage regions affected by COVID-19 to appropriately amend their current criteria.	Diagnosis
34205098	The Pro-Inflammatory Chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 Are Upregulated Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection in an AKT-Dependent Manner. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible RNA virus that is the causative agent of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients with severe COVID-19 may develop acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require mechanical ventilation. Key features of SARS-CoV-2 induced pulmonary complications include an overexpression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that contribute to a 'cytokine storm.' In the current study an inflammatory state in Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells was characterized in which significantly elevated transcripts of the immunostimulatory chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were present. Additionally, an increase in gene expression of the cytokines IL-6, TNFalpha, and IFN-gamma was observed. The transcription of CXCL9, CXCL10, IL-6, and IFN-gamma was also induced in the lungs of human transgenic angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. To elucidate cell signaling pathways responsible for chemokine upregulation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, small molecule inhibitors targeting key signaling kinases were used. The induction of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 gene expression in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection was markedly reduced by treatment with the AKT inhibitor GSK690693. Samples from COVID-19 positive individuals also displayed marked increases in CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 transcripts as well as transcripts in the AKT pathway. The current study elucidates potential pathway specific targets for reducing the induction of chemokines that may be contributing to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis via hyperinflammation.	Mechanism;Treatment
34225607	"Mechanistic Aspects of Medicinal Plants and Secondary Metabolites against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a highly pathogenic virus, is responsible for a respiratory disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes various structural and non-structural proteins, which are necessary for viral entry and replication. Among these proteins, papain-like protease (PLpro), 3C-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, a serine protease, and spike protein are potential targets of herbal remedies and phytocompounds for inhibition of viral infection and replication. There is at present no confirmed cure for the COVID-19. Various plants and their components have been introduced against SARS-Co-2. A number of review articles have also been published on them. This article is focusing on the mechanistic aspects of these plants and their derivatives on SARS-CV-2. METHOD: The material in this review article was prepared from significant scientific databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Google Scholar. RESULTS: Different medicinal plants and their phytocompounds interact with important structural and non-structural of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Natural compounds form strong bonds with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 protease and make large conformational changes. These phytochemicals are potential inhibitors of structural and non-structural of SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as Spike protein, PLpro, and 3CLpro. Some important anti-SARS-CoV-2 actions of medicinal plants and their metabolites are inhibition of the virus replication or entry, blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and ""Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)"" regulation of inflammatory mediators, inhibition of endothelial activation, toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Some of these important natural immune boosters that are helpful for prevention and curing various symptoms related to COVID-19 include Allium sativum, Nigella sativa, Glycyrrhiza glabra Zingiber officinalis, Ocimum sanctum, Withania somnifera, Tinospora cordifolia, and Scutellaria baicalensis. Also, Kaempferol, Quercetin, Baicalin, Scutellarin, Glycyrrhizin, Curcumin, Apigenin, Ursolic acid, and Chloroquine are the best candidates for treating the symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Medicinal plants and/or their bioactive compounds with inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 support the human immune system and help in fighting against COVID-19 and rejuvenating the immune system."

34363909	COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in patients with Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Disease: Review of available evidence. Dermatologists diagnose and treat many immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID). Understanding the inherent immune dysregulation of these diseases as well as the additional disruption that comes as a result of IMID treatments has been important during the COVID-19 pandemic. With vaccines becoming widely available, dermatologists need to be familiar with the risks and benefits of vaccination in these patients, particularly those taking biologics, in order to have informed discussions with their patients. In this review, we present the current evidence related to COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in patients with IMID and review existing recommendations for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Given the current evidence, there is minimal concern that these patients are at any greater risk of harm from COVID-19 vaccination compared to healthy controls. For most, the benefit of avoiding severe COVID-19 through vaccination will outweigh the theoretical risk of these vaccines. An outstanding question is whether patients on biologics will generate a sufficient immune response to the vaccine, which may be dependent on the specific biologic therapy and indication being treated. This underscores the importance of following patients with IMID after vaccination to determine vaccine safety, efficacy, and duration in this population.	Treatment
34355868	Physical Activity May Mitigate COVID-19 Infections In People With Obesity: A Call to Action. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, 42.5% of adults and 18.5% of children had obesity(1,2) and less than 50% of the population met physical activity recommendations.(3) Emerging evidence indicates that physical activity declined during the pandemic, likely due in part to school closures and restricted access to common indoor and outdoor places where people are active. Public health interventions are urgently needed to promote an active lifestyle and engagement in physical activity to mitigate the physical and mental adverse impact of COVID-19. (4) The association between obesity and the increased risk of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and death is unequivocal.(5,6) Furthermore, obesity increases the risk of intubation and death in patients less than 65 years old infected with COVID-19, independent of diabetes and hypertension.

34344174	Respiratory Distress in Hospitalized Non-Mechanically Ventilated COVID-19 Adults: A Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 typically presents with respiratory symptoms which may progress with severe disease. There are standard guidelines for managing respiratory distress (e.g. opioids, anxiolytics) and palliative care teams are well versed in managing these symptoms. AIM: Determine the extent to which hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate respiratory distress received medications or palliative consultation for symptom management and if these interventions had any association with outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review for hospitalized COVID-19+ patients from March 2-April 30, 2020. SETTING: Large integrated health system in the New York Metropolitan area. PATIENTS: 312 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with an order for a non-rebreather mask and meeting criteria for moderate respiratory distress on the Respiratory Distress Observation Scale: concurrent respiratory rate >/=30 and heart rate >/=110 at any point during hospitalization. Patients receiving mechanical ventilation or intensive care were excluded. RESULTS: Most COVID-19 patients experiencing moderate respiratory distress did not receive medications or palliative consultation for symptom management. Patients who received medications were predominantly white, older, and had a Do-Not-Resuscitate order. Patients who received a palliative consultation were more likely to be older, female, and white, with a Do-Not-Resuscitate order. Mortality was similar between those receiving medication and those who did not. CONCLUSION: Medications and palliative expertise for symptom management were underused for patients with moderate respiratory distress due to COVID-19. Education and triggers may help providers to identify moderate respiratory distress and consider symptomatic treatment and palliative consultation when appropriate.	Treatment;Diagnosis
34226597	Eight months follow-up study on pulmonary function, lung radiographic, and related physiological characteristics in COVID-19 survivors. To describe the long-term health outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and investigate the potential risk factors. Clinical data during hospitalization and at a mean (SD) day of 249 (15) days after discharge from 40 survivors with confirmed COVID-19 (including 25 severe cases) were collected and analyzed retrospectively. At follow-up, severe cases had higher incidences of persistent symptoms, DLCO impairment, and higher abnormal CT score as compared with mild cases. CT score at follow-up was positively correlated with age, LDH level, cumulative days of oxygen treatment, total dosage of glucocorticoids used, and CT peak score during hospitalization. DLCO% at follow-up was negatively correlated with cumulative days of oxygen treatment during hospitalization. DLCO/VA% at follow-up was positively correlated with BMI, and TNF-alpha level. Among the three groups categorized as survivors with normal DLCO, abnormal DLCO but normal DLCO/VA, and abnormal DLCO and DLCO/VA, survivors with abnormal DLCO and DLCO/VA had the lowest serum IL-2R, IL-8, and TNF-alpha level, while the survivors with abnormal DLCO but normal DLCO/VA had the highest levels of inflammatory cytokines during hospitalization. Altogether, COVID-19 had a greater long-term impact on the lung physiology of severe cases. The long-term radiological abnormality maybe relate to old age and the severity of COVID-19. Either absent or excess of inflammation during COVID-19 course would lead to the impairment of pulmonary diffusion function.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34201591	Successful Clearance of 300 Day SARS-CoV-2 Infection in a Subject with B-Cell Depletion Associated Prolonged (B-DEAP) COVID by REGEN-COV Anti-Spike Monoclonal Antibody Cocktail. A 59-year-old male with follicular lymphoma treated by anti-CD20-mediated B-cell depletion and ablative chemotherapy was hospitalized with a COVID-19 infection. Although the patient did not develop specific humoral immunity, he had a mild clinical course overall. The failure of all therapeutic options allowed infection to persist nearly 300 days with active accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations. As a rescue therapy, an infusion of REGEN-COV (10933 and 10987) anti-spike monoclonal antibodies was performed 270 days from initial diagnosis. Due to partial clearance after the first dose (2.4 g), a consolidation dose (8 g) was infused six weeks later. Complete virus clearance could then be observed over the following month, after he was vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech anti-COVID-19 vaccination. The successful management of this patient required prolonged enhanced quarantine, monitoring of virus mutations, pioneering clinical decisions based upon close consultation, and the coordination of multidisciplinary experts in virology, immunology, pharmacology, input from REGN, the FDA, the IRB, the health care team, the patient, and the patient's family. Current decisions to take revolve around patient's follicular lymphoma management, and monitoring for virus clearance persistence beyond disappearance of REGEN-COV monoclonal antibodies after anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Overall, specific guidelines for similar cases should be established.	Case Report
34287987	Combination therapy with onasemnogene and risdiplam in spinal muscular atrophy type 1. INTRODUCTION/AIMS: There are currently three medications approved for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), but the use of these medications in combination has not been well described. METHODS: This is a retrospective report of four cases of SMA treated with dual onasemnogene and risdiplam therapy at our institution. RESULTS: Following onasemnogene therapy, all four patients experienced a perceived plateau of therapeutic benefit, at which time daily risdiplam was started. Transient fatigue and weakness was seen in two patients following risdiplam initiation, but this resolved within 1 mo. One patient was hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and post-viral pneumonia, weeks following risdiplam initiation. No other adverse effects related to onasemnogene and risdiplam combination therapy were identified and all patients experienced objective and subjective improvement. DISCUSSION: Combination therapy with onasemnogene and risdiplam in patients with SMA appears to be well-tolerated. Further large prospective trials are needed to determine whether dual therapy is more efficacious than monotherapy, and to identify rare adverse events that may occur with the use of combination therapy.

34219749	Wildlife rehabilitation centers as a potential source of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 into native wildlife of Latin America. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the entire world, causing a great number of mortality of humans and affecting the economy, while conservation efforts are finally recognized to prevent further pandemics. The wildlife rehabilitation centers (WRCs) play a relevant role in animal welfare; nevertheless, they also represent an imminent risk of pathogen transmission between humans-to-animals and between animals. Moreover, WRCs could spread pathogens into natural habitats through the reintroduction of infectious individuals. These biosafety concerns at WRCs may increase as the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 extends. We explored the current situation of Latin American WRCs under the COVID-19 pandemic to determine the feasibility of SARS-CoV-2 introduction, amplification, and spread within these institutions. We surveyed WRCs from eight Latin American countries. We found that pandemic is affecting these institutions in many aspects: workers with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, reduced economic resources, and lack of information and support from governmental authorities. These have forced WRCs to reduce the workforce, veterinary visits, and animal food rations and to increase the number of animals released. This scenario generates a risky environment for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially for felids, mustelids, and non-human primates. Therefore, it is imperative to respect quarantine periods, monitor incoming patients, increase biosecurity measures, develop and apply guidelines and recommendations for the protection of personnel and biosafety of enclosures and instruments. It is of utmost importance the proper and safer reintroduction of recovered wildlife.	Prevention;Transmission
34282206	Frequency and phenotype of headache in covid-19: a study of 2194 patients. To estimate the frequency of headache in patients with confirmed COVID-19 and characterize the phenotype of headache attributed to COVID-19, comparing patients depending on the need of hospitalization and sex, an observational study was done. We systematically screened all eligible patients from a reference population of 261,431 between March 8 (first case) and April 11, 2020. A physician administered a survey assessing demographic and clinical data and the phenotype of the headache. During the study period, 2194 patients out of the population at risk were diagnosed with COVID-19. Headache was described by 514/2194 patients (23.4%, 95% CI 21.7-25.3%), including 383/1614 (23.7%) outpatients and 131/580 (22.6%) inpatients. The headache phenotype was studied in detail in 458 patients (mean age, 51 years; 72% female; prior history of headache, 49%). Headache was the most frequent first symptom of COVID-19. Median headache onset was within 24 h, median duration was 7 days and persisted after 1 month in 13% of patients. Pain was bilateral (80%), predominantly frontal (71%), with pressing quality (75%), of severe intensity. Systemic symptoms were present in 98% of patients. Headache frequency and phenotype was similar in patients with and without need for hospitalization and when comparing male and female patients, being more intense in females.Trial registration: This study was supported by the Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII), code 07.04.467804.74011 and Regional Health Administration, Gerencia Regional de Salud, Castilla y Leon (GRS: 2289/A/2020).

34213460	Universal health coverage and tuberculosis care in India in the times of Covid-19: Aligning Ayushman Bharat (National Health Assurance Scheme) to improve case detection, reduce deaths and catastrophic health expenditure. India has the largest global burden of new cases of tuberculosis (TB) and deaths due to TB. These occur predominantly in the poor who suffer catastrophic costs during diagnosis and treatment. The National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme has ambitious goals of 80% reduction of incidence of TB, 90% reduction in mortality due to TB by 2025 and 0% occurrence of catastrophic costs to households affected by TB by 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting disruption to TB services are expected to worsen the situation. There are gaps in case finding at the peripheral level and access to care at the higher level for patients with TB. An estimated 32% patients with active TB do not access diagnostic services, while catastrophic costs associated with hospitalization are a barrier to access for seriously ill patients. Deaths due to TB in India occur largely at home and not in medical facilities, and are preventable with appropriate inpatient care. The Ayushman Bharat scheme with its Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) and coverage for inpatient care under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) can facilitate, the achievement of the goals of TB elimination. The HWCs provide an opportunity to close the case-finding gap as first point of contact by enabling sputum transport services to the designated microscopy centres. This will facilitate case detection, reduce diagnostic delays, and decrease community transmission and the incidence of TB.

34215274	Health and socio-demographic implications of the Covid-19 second pandemic wave in Israel, compared with the first wave. BACKGROUND: Israel's containment of the first wave of Covid-19 was relatively successful. Soon afterwards, however, in the summer months, a harsher pandemic wave developed, resulting in many more seriously ill and dead Israelis. Israel was the world's first country to impose a second general lockdown. The present study outlines the early months of Israel's second pandemic wave, until the imposition of the second general lockdown, and their impact on various communities. The investigation is conducted in conjunction with five sociodemographic variables: population density, socioeconomic status, rate of elderly population, minority status (Jewish / Arab identity) and religiosity (Ultra-Orthodox vs. other Jewish communities). METHODS: The analysis is based on a cross sectional study of morbidity rates, investigated on a residential community basis. Following the descriptive statistics, we move on to present a multivariate analysis to explore associations between the five aforementioned sociodemographic variables and Covid-19 morbidity in Israel in the early second pandemic wave vs. the first Covid-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Both the descriptive statistics and regressions show morbidity rates to be significantly and positively associated with communities' population density and significantly and negatively associated with socioeconomic status (SES) and the size of elderly population. These results differ from Wave I morbidity, which was not significantly associated with SES. Another difference vis-a-vis Wave I is the rise of morbidity in Arab communities that led to the disappearance of the previously observed significant negative association of morbidity with minority (Arab) status. Exceptional morbidity was found in Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities. CONCLUSION: The second wave of Covid-19 in Israel has profoundly affected marginalized communities characterized by high residential density, low SES and minority status. Other marginalized and disempowered communities have also been badly hit. While acknowledging the potential contribution of various possible causes, we highlight the policy response of Israel's government during the early weeks of the second Covid-19 outbreak, suggesting that the severe second wave might possibly be associated with belated, undecided government response during this period.

34283219	"Pharmacist intervention on prescribing errors: Use of a standardized approach in the inpatient setting. DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to implement a standardized process across health systems to determine the prevalence and clinical relevance of prescribing errors intercepted by pharmacists. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted across 11 hospitals. Pharmacist-intercepted prescribing errors were collected during inpatient order verification over 6 consecutive weeks utilizing a standardized documentation process. The potential harm of each error was evaluated using a modified National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC-MERP) index with physician validation, and errors were stratified into those with potentially low, serious, or life-threatening harm. Endpoints included the median error rate per 1,000 patient days, error type, and potential harm with correlating cost avoidance. RESULTS: Pharmacists intervened on 7,187 errors, resulting in a mean error rate of 39 errors per 1,000 patient days. Among the errors, 46.6% (n = 3,349) were determined to have potentially serious consequences and 2.4% (n = 175) could have been life-threatening if not intercepted. This equates to $874,000 in avoided cost. The top 3 error types occurring with the highest frequency were ""wrong dose/rate/frequency"" (n = 2,298, 32.0%), ""duplicate therapy"" (n = 1,431, 19.9%), and ""wrong timing"" (n = 960, 13.4%). ""Wrong dose/rate/frequency"" (n = 49, 28%), ""duplicate therapy"" (n = 26, 14.9%), and ""drug-disease interaction"" (n = 24, 13.7%) errors occurred with the highest frequency among errors with potential for life-threatening harm. ""Wrong dose/rate/frequency"" (n = 1,028, 30.7%), ""wrong timing"" (n = 573, 17.1%), and ""duplicate therapy"" (n = 482, 14.4%) errors occurred with the highest frequency among errors with potentially serious harm. CONCLUSION: Documentation of pharmacist intervention on prescribing errors via a standardized process creates a platform for multicenter analysis of prescribing error trends and an opportunity for development of system-wide solutions to reduce potential harm from prescribing errors."

34226231	SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthcare workers of a Swiss tertiary care centre at the end of the first wave: a cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in healthcare workers (HCWs) using seroprevalence as a surrogate marker of infection in our tertiary care centre according to exposure. DESIGN: Seroprevalence cross-sectional study. SETTING: Single centre at the end of the first COVID-19 wave in Lausanne, Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: 1874 of 4074 responders randomly selected (46% response rate), stratified by work category among the 13 474 (13.9%) HCWs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 serostatus paired with a questionnaire of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition risk factors internal and external to the workplace. RESULTS: The overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rate among HCWs was 10.0% (95% CI 8.7% to 11.5%). HCWs with daily patient contact did not experience increased rates of seropositivity relative to those without (10.3% vs 9.6%, respectively, p=0.64). HCWs with direct contact with patients with COVID-19 or working in COVID-19 units did not experience increased seropositivity rates relative to their counterparts (10.4% vs 9.8%, p=0.69 and 10.6% vs 9.9%, p=0.69, respectively). However, specific locations of contact with patients irrespective of COVID-19 status-in patient rooms or reception areas-did correlate with increased rates of seropositivity (11.9% vs 7.5%, p=0.019 and 14.3% vs 9.2%, p=0.025, respectively). In contrast, HCWs with a suspected or proven SARS-CoV-2-infected household contact had significantly higher seropositivity rates than those without such contacts (19.0% vs 8.7%, p<0.001 and 42.1% vs 9.4%, p<0.001, respectively). Finally, consistent use of a mask on public transportation correlated with decreased seroprevalence (5.3% for mask users vs 11.2% for intermittent or no mask use, p=0.030). CONCLUSIONS: The overall seroprevalence was 10% without significant differences in seroprevalence between HCWs exposed to patients with COVID-19 and HCWs not exposed. This suggests that, once fully in place, protective measures limited SARS-CoV-2 occupational acquisition within the hospital environment. SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion among HCWs was associated primarily with community risk factors, particularly household transmission.	Diagnosis;Prevention;Transmission
34212566	Compassionate mesenchymal stem cell treatment in a severe COVID-19 patient: a case report. COVID-19 presentations range from cold-like symptoms to severe symptoms with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We report on a severe COVID-19 patient who was mechanically ventilated and who developed ARDS and bacterial infection. Because of rapid clinical deterioration and the exhaustion of other treatment options, the family and attending physicians requested a compassionate use of adult allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in addition to commonly used immunosuppressive, antiviral, and supportive therapy. The clinical course is discussed thoroughly, with a special emphasis on the safety and effect of MSC therapy. Compassionate MSC treatment, given in three rounds, affected ARDS regression. The patient was discharged from the intensive care unit after 31 days and from hospital after 49 days in a good general condition. MSC treatment was not associated with any side effects and was well tolerated in a three-week period; therefore, it should be studied in larger trials and considered for compassionate use.

34281079	"Assessment of Referrals and Hospitalizations in the Hospital Transformed into COVID-19 Facility in Poland during the ""Spring Wave"" of the Epidemic in 2020-A Cross-Sectional Study. The study aimed to evaluate hospitalizations in a COVID-dedicated facility during the ""spring wave"" of the epidemic in 2020 in Poland and analyze changes in access to hospital treatment in the country in the early phase of the pandemic. We investigated all referrals and admissions to the Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Bialystok from 14 April to 14 August 2020. A total of 238 patients were referred to the hospital (with a median age of 64.5 years; IQR, 44-78), most commonly with fever (n = 151; 63.5%). Only 135 (56.7%) were admitted (5.5% of the number hospitalized in the same period in 2019). SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in 42 (17.7%) cases. Older people with concomitant diseases and disabilities dominated. Seventeen patients (12.6%) required ICU treatment, and 19 (14%) died. Based on the National Health Fund data, we also examined changes in the rate of hospitalizations in Poland and in selected Polish COVID/ and non-COVID hospitals between February and August 2019 and 2020. The number of hospitalizations in Poland decreased dramatically in comparison to 2019. A very low hospitalization rate, significantly lower than in structurally similar non-COVID hospitals, was observed in transformed hospitals. Better use of hospital resources was observed when the hospital was semi-transformed and had the flexibility to adapt to epidemiological needs. The study seems to confirm that the system of transformed COVID hospitals resulted in unused healthcare resources and limited patient access to medical services in the early period of the epidemic. As a consequence, systemic modifications allowing the maximization and adequate use of the Polish healthcare system's limited resources have been implemented."	Prevention
34219906	Fundamental evolution of all Orthocoronavirinae including three deadly lineages descendent from Chiroptera-hosted coronaviruses: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in humans in 2002. Despite reports showing Chiroptera as the original animal reservoir of SARS-CoV, many argue that Carnivora-hosted viruses are the most likely origin. The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 also involves Chiroptera-hosted lineages. However, factors such as the lack of comprehensive phylogenies hamper our understanding of host shifts once MERS-CoV emerged in humans and Artiodactyla. Since 2019, the origin of SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), added to this episodic history of zoonotic transmission events. Here we introduce a phylogenetic analysis of 2006 unique and complete genomes of different lineages of Orthocoronavirinae. We used gene annotations to align orthologous sequences for total evidence analysis under the parsimony optimality criterion. Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus were set as outgroups to understand spillovers of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus among ten orders of animals. We corroborated that Chiroptera-hosted viruses are the sister group of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-related viruses. Other zoonotic events were qualified and quantified to provide a comprehensive picture of the risk of coronavirus emergence among humans. Finally, we used a 250 SARS-CoV-2 genomes dataset to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and Chiroptera-hosted coronaviruses.	Mechanism;Transmission

34284342	Hyperacute reversible encephalopathy related to cytokine storm following COVID-19 vaccine. We describe the first case of hyperacute reversible encephalopathy following COVID-19 vaccination. A patient presented with acute onset encephalopathy, mainly characterized by agitation and confusion, rapidly responsive to high dosage steroid therapy and complete remission within 3 days from onset. The clinical manifestation was related with systemic and CSF cytokine hyperproduction, responsive to steroid therapy. Although the occurrence of encephalopathy after vaccination may be just a casual temporal association, we speculate that the cytokine-storm could be the result of an excessive innate immune response against the vaccine, in a predisposed patient susceptible to autoimmunity.

34226237	Fitness, strength and severity of COVID-19: a prospective register study of 1 559 187 Swedish conscripts. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible connection between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscle strength in early adulthood and severity of COVID-19 later in life. DESIGN: Prospective registry-based cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: 1 559 187 Swedish men, undergoing military conscription between 1968 and 2005 at a mean age of 18.3 (SD 0.73) years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalisation, intensive care or death due to COVID-19 from March to September 2020, in relation to CRF and muscle strength. RESULTS: High CRF in late adolescence and early adulthood had a protective association with severe COVID-19 later in life with OR (95% CI) 0.76 (0.67 to 0.85) for hospitalisation (n=2 006), 0.61 (0.48 to 0.78) for intensive care (n=445) and 0.56 (0.37 to 0.85) for mortality (n=149), compared with the lowest category of CRF. The association remains unchanged when controlled for body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, chronic diseases and parental education level at baseline, and incident cardiovascular disease before 2020. Moreover, lower muscle strength in late adolescence showed a linear association with a higher risk of all three outcomes when controlled for BMI and height. CONCLUSIONS: Physical fitness at a young age is associated with severity of COVID-19 many years later. This underscores the necessity to increase the general physical fitness of the population to offer protection against future viral pandemics.	Treatment;Diagnosis
34071479	Deferoxamine B: A Natural, Excellent and Versatile Metal Chelator. Deferoxamine B is an outstanding molecule which has been widely studied in the past decade for its ability to bind iron and many other metal ions. The versatility of this metal chelator makes it suitable for a number of medicinal and analytical applications, from the well-known iron chelation therapy to the most recent use in sensor devices. The three bidentate hydroxamic functional groups of deferoxamine B are the centerpiece of its metal binding ability, which allows the formation of stable complexes with many transition, lanthanoid and actinoid metal ions. In addition to the ferric ion, in fact, more than 20 different metal complexes of deferoxamine b have been characterized in terms of their chemical speciation in solution. In addition, the availability of a terminal amino group, most often not involved in complexation, opens the way to deferoxamine B modification and functionalization. This review aims to collect and summarize the available data concerning the complex-formation equilibria in solutions of deferoxamine B with different metal ions. A general overview of the progress of its applications over the past decade is also discussed, including the treatment of iron overload-associated diseases, its clinical use against cancer and neurodegenerative disorders and its role as a diagnostic tool.

34205724	Lessons Learned during a Naturalistic Study of Online Treatment for Pediatric Rehabilitation. The COVID-19 pandemic forced many health care providers to modify their service model by adopting telehealth and tele-rehabilitation with minimal time to plan for its execution. ALYN-Pediatric Rehabilitation Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel, responded with alacrity by providing a broad range of rehabilitation services to young people via online therapy during the first 5 months of the pandemic. The objectives of this naturalistic study were: (1) to monitor usage and user experience of online rehabilitation provided to young people receiving out-patient sessions of physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and psychology and (2) to consider the advantages and disadvantages of retaining this model of online treatment in full or in part post-COVID-19. The online rehabilitation treatment program was provided to 147 young people, aged 3 months to 20 years (mean 8.5 y; SD 5.3), and monitored and evaluated via data from the medical records as well as interviews, questionnaires and focus groups. The results use descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze data on the types and frequencies of therapy provided to 147 young people. Over a five month-period, 2392 therapy sessions were provided, 61 therapists from four disciplines were involved and 56.4% of the young people received two or more types of therapies via online rehabilitation. A repeated measures ANOVA showed significant differences over time per therapy. Feedback and recommendations about the process from therapists, parents and young people were collected during two focus groups of the professional staff (n = 12), parents and young people (parents n = 5, young people n = 3). Tele-rehabilitation services were perceived to be beneficial and effective by the great majority of young people, their parents and the healthcare professionals. The results are discussed within the context of conventional therapy as well as in comparison to reports of other online services for similar populations. We conclude that a hybrid approach in which in-person therapy sessions are coordinated with synchronous, online sessions, will provide a best-case fit for young people with chronic disabilities.

34211649	Potential predictors of outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma: a single-center study. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is a major international public health crisis, which has led to over 3 million deaths as of April 2021. Several therapeutics have been tried for this deadly illness including antivirals, immunosuppressive agents and convalescent plasma (CP). In this study, we present our inner-city safety net hospital experience with CP therapy. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were treated with CP. Results: A total of 60 patients received CP during the study period. The mean age for patients in this study was 58.95 years. The most common presenting symptoms were shortness of breath (85%) and cough (73%). Hypertension (65%) and diabetes mellitus (55%) were the most common comorbidities in our patients. In our multivariate regression analysis, male sex, nausea and loss of appetite at presentation were associated with improvement in oxygenation after CP. Total survival time, history of obstructive airway disease, home use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers were associated with decreased survival, whereas Hispanic ethnicity showed a trend towards lower survival after CP therapy. Conclusions: Our study highlights several important characteristics of inner-city safety net hospital patient population who might benefit from CP therapy.	Treatment;Diagnosis

BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance is important to reduce the rate of transmission of virulent pathogens to health care workers. Medical officer compliance with PPE protocol for COVID-19 was audited in a regional hospital in Australia early in the pandemic response. METHODS: Compliance was assessed based on the order and technique of donning and doffing PPE, with medical officers from multiple departments and levels of seniority audited. RESULTS: Average compliance from all participants was 58.61% with donning and 68.84% with doffing. CONCLUSION: Medical Officer compliance with PPE donning and doffing was poor and additional training was required.	Prevention
34229195	Assessing spatial distribution of COVID-19 prevalence in Brazil using decentralised sewage monitoring. Brazil has become one of the epicentres of the COVID-19 pandemic, with cases heavily concentrated in large cities. Testing data is extremely limited and unreliable, which restricts health authorities' ability to deal with the pandemic. Given the stark demographic, social and economic heterogeneities within Brazilian cities, it is important to identify hotspots so that the limited resources available can have the greatest impact. This study shows that decentralised monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage can be used to assess the distribution of COVID-19 prevalence in the city. The methodology developed in this study allowed the identification of hotspots by comprehensively monitoring sewers distributed through Belo Horizonte, Brazil's third largest city. Our results show that the most vulnerable neighbourhoods in the city were the hardest hit by the pandemic, indicating that, for many Brazilians, the situation is much worse than reported by official figures.

34200648	COVID-19 Vaccination in Patients with Classic Kaposi's Sarcoma. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has represented an overwhelming challenge for worldwide health systems. Patients with cancer are considered at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and increased mortality in case of infection. Although data on the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in patients with cancer are limited, there is enough evidence supporting anti-infective vaccination in general in patients with active cancer, or with history of previous malignancy. Subjects with classic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) represent a small subset of cancer patients, which should be considered at heightened risk for infections due to several factors including age, and impaired immune function status. Several cases of human herpesviruses reactivation among critically ill COVID-19 patients have been described. Moreover, in case of severe infection and treatment with immunomodulating agents, patients with CKS are exposed at significant risk of viral reactivation and disease progression. Considering the baseline clinical risk factors of patients with CKS, and the complex interplay of the two viral agents, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination should be strongly recommended among patients with KS. KS represents an interesting field to study the interactions among chronic viral infections, SARS-CoV-2 and the host's immune system. Prospective observational studies are needed to provide more insights on vaccine activity and safety among patients with cancer, optimal vaccine schedules, potential interactions with antineoplastic therapies, and other comorbidities including chronic viral infections.

34227769	Clinical Presentation of Cases with SARS-CoV-2 Reinfection/ Reactivation. Background: Reinfection/reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 has been a matter of great interest from the immunological and vaccine perspective. However, little is known about the clinical presentation of such reinfection/reactivation. We report a case series of 9 COVID-19 patients having experienced two clinically- and/or virologically-confirmed episodes of COVID-19. Methods: Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 9 healthcare workers (HCWs) with two episodes of SARS-CoV-2 are described. Results: The incidence of reinfection/reactivation amongst the HCWs was 2% (9 out of 491) with an average remission period of 66 days (range 43-78 days). Amongst the cases of reinfection 4/9 were asymptomatic in first episode were symptomatic in second episode. There is negative correlation between numbers of days the patients took to become SARS-CoV-2 negative by RT-CPR and/or clinically recover in the first episode and the second episode irrespective for the time spent in remission. Conclusion: Shorter durations of SARS-COV-2 infection in the first episode are associated with longer time to recovery in the second episode in patients with re-infection/reactivation.	Case Report
34281065	Impact of Mass Workplace COVID-19 Rapid Testing on Health and Healthcare Resource Savings. Background: The epidemiological situation generated by COVID-19 has cast into sharp relief the delicate balance between public health priorities and the economy, with businesses obliged to toe the line between employee health and continued production. In an effort to detect as many cases as possible, isolate contacts, cut transmission chains, and limit the spread of the virus in the workplace, mass testing strategies have been implemented in both public health and industrial contexts to minimize the risk of disruption in activity. Objective: To evaluate the economic impact of the mass workplace testing strategy as carried out by a large automotive company in Catalonia in terms of health and healthcare resource savings. Methodology: Analysis of health costs and impacts based on the estimation of the mortality and morbidity avoided because of screening, and the resulting savings in healthcare costs. Results: The economic impact of the mass workplace testing strategies (using both PCR and RAT tests) was approximately euro10.44 per test performed or euro5575.49 per positive detected; 38% of this figure corresponds to savings derived from better use of health resources (hospital beds, ICU beds, and follow-up of infected cases), while the remaining 62% corresponds to improved health rates due to the avoided morbidity and mortality. In scenarios with higher positivity rates and a greater impact of the infection on health and the use of health resources, these results could be up to ten times higher (euro130.24 per test performed or euro69,565.59 per positive detected). Conclusion: In the context of COVID-19, preventive actions carried out by the private sector to safeguard industrial production also have concomitant public benefits in the form of savings in healthcare costs. Thus, governmental bodies need to recognize the value of implementing such strategies in private settings and facilitate them through, for example, subsidies.	Prevention
34207696	HERC5 and the ISGylation Pathway: Critical Modulators of the Antiviral Immune Response. Mammalian cells have developed an elaborate network of immunoproteins that serve to identify and combat viral pathogens. Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is a 15.2 kDa tandem ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) that is used by specific E1-E2-E3 ubiquitin cascade enzymes to interfere with the activity of viral proteins. Recent biochemical studies have demonstrated how the E3 ligase HECT and RCC1-containing protein 5 (HERC5) regulates ISG15 signaling in response to hepatitis C (HCV), influenza-A (IAV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections. Taken together, the potent antiviral activity displayed by HERC5 and ISG15 make them promising drug targets for the development of novel antiviral therapeutics that can augment the host antiviral response. In this review, we examine the emerging role of ISG15 in antiviral immunity with a particular focus on how HERC5 orchestrates the specific and timely ISGylation of viral proteins in response to infection.

34207413	Collaborative and Structured Network for Maintenance of Mechanical Ventilators during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Brazil has grown rapidly since the first case was reported on 26 February 2020. As the pandemic has spread, the low availability of medical equipment has increased, especially mechanical ventilators. The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) claimed to have only 40,508 mechanical ventilators, which would be insufficient to support the Brazilian population at the pandemic peak. This lack of ventilators, especially in public hospitals, required quick, assertive, and effective actions to minimize the health crisis. This work provides an overview of the rapid deployment of a network for maintaining disused mechanical ventilators in public and private healthcare units in some regions of Brazil during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data referring to the processes of maintaining equipment, acquiring parts, and conducting national and international training were collected and analyzed. In total, 4047 ventilators were received by the maintenance sites, and 2516 ventilators were successfully repaired and returned to the healthcare units, which represents a success rate of 62.17%. The results show that the maintenance initiative directly impacted the availability and reliability of the equipment, allowing access to ventilators in the public and private health system and increasing the capacity of beds during the pandemic.

34199495	Healthcare Professionals' Role in Social Media Public Health Campaigns: Analysis of Spanish Pro Vaccination Campaign on Twitter. The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a great impact worldwide both on the population health but also on an economic and social level. In this health emergency, a key element has been and still is the need for information, which has become a daily concern for many people. Social media represent powerful tools for searching and gathering health-related information, thus becoming a new place where health authorities need to be present to disseminate information of preventive measures like vaccines against COVID-19, as well as try to block information against these public health measures. The main goal of this study was to analyze the role that healthcare professionals have in Twitter to support the campaign of public institutions on vaccination against COVID-19. To address this study, an analysis of the messages sent on Twitter containing the hashtag #yomevacuno, between 12 December 2020 was developed using the NodeXL software (Social Media Research Foundation, Redwood, CA, USA), focusing on content analysis of tweets and users' accounts to identify healthcare professionals. The results show that healthcare professionals represent only 11.38% of users, being responsible for 6.35% of impressions generated by the network #yomevacuno. We can observe that traffic information generated by healthcare professionals is not significant in comparison with institutions (p = 0.633), but it is compared to common users (p = 0.0014). The most active healthcare professionals were pharmacists (40.17%), nurses (27.17%), and physicians (12.14%). Their activity (90.43% of messages) was mainly focused on sharing messages generated by other users' accounts. From original content generated by healthcare professionals, only 78.95% had a favorable storytelling on the vaccine, but without sharing information about vaccines or vaccination. As a conclusion for this study, the participation of healthcare professionals in the dissemination and generation of information within the #yomevacuno communication strategy, led by the Spanish Ministry of Health, has been scarce. We emphasize the need to enhance communication skills in social networks to support public health campaigns through these increasingly important social media.	Prevention
34202330	The Relevance of Plant-Derived Se Compounds to Human Health in the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Pandemic Era. Dietary selenium (Se)-compounds accumulated in plants are essential for human metabolism and normal physiological processes. Inorganic and organic Se species can be readily absorbed by the human body, but are metabolized differently and thus exhibit distinct mechanisms of action. They can act as antioxidants or serve as a source of Se for the synthesis of selenoproteins. Selenocysteine, in particular, is incorporated at the catalytic center of these proteins through a specific insertion mechanism and, due to its electronic features, enhances their catalytic activity against biological oxidants. Selenite and other Se-organic compounds may also act as direct antioxidants in cells due to their strong nucleophilic properties. In addition, Se-amino acids are more easily subjected to oxidation than the corresponding thiols/thioethers and can bind redox-active metal ions. Adequate Se intake aids in preventing several metabolic disorders and affords protection against viral infections. At present, an epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) threatens human health across several countries and impacts the global economy. Therefore, Se-supplementation could be a complementary treatment to vaccines and pharmacological drugs to reduce the viral load, mutation frequency, and enhance the immune system of populations with low Se intake in the diet.

34222777	Case report of a very late dual coronary stent thrombosis in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019. Background : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with hypercoagulability and a high rate of thrombosis. Few cases of coronary stent thrombosis associated with COVID-19 have been reported. Case summary : In this report, we describe the case of a 65-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction revealing a very late dual coronary stent thrombosis of the left anterior descending and posterior descending arteries. Ten days prior to admission, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with dexamethasone, which led to rapid clinical improvement. After resuscitation, coronary angiography revealed an acute thrombotic occlusion in the two previous drug-eluting stents (implanted in 2010 and 2018), with a high thrombus burden. He was successfully treated by percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient did not present any further complications during his hospital stay and was transferred to a cardiac rehabilitation centre. Discussion : Dual stent thrombosis is an exceptional event highlighting the high procoagulant state promoted by coronavirus 19. This case suggests that strengthening of antithrombotic therapy in CAD patients presenting with COVID-19 should be discussed.	Case Report
34207266	Imaging Cardiovascular Inflammation in the COVID-19 Era. Cardiac complications are among the most frequent extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 and are associated with high mortality rates. Moreover, positive SARS-CoV-2 patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are more likely to require intensive care and are at higher risk of death. The underlying mechanism for myocardial injury is multifaceted, in which the severe inflammatory response causes myocardial inflammation, coronary plaque destabilization, acute thrombotic events, and ischemia. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is the non-invasive method of choice for identifying myocardial injury, and it is able to differentiate between underlying causes in various and often challenging clinical scenarios. Multimodal imaging protocols that incorporate CMR and computed tomography provide a complex evaluation for both respiratory and cardiovascular complications of SARS-CoV2 infection. This, in relation to biological evaluation of systemic inflammation, can guide appropriate therapeutic management in every stage of the disease. The use of artificial intelligence can further improve the diagnostic accuracy of these imaging techniques, thus enabling risk stratification and evaluation of prognosis. The present manuscript aims to review the current knowledge on the possible modalities for imaging COVID-related myocardial inflammation or post-COVID coronary inflammation and atherosclerosis.

34219684	Determining the frequency of serious adverse reactions of inactive SARS-COV-2 vaccine. BACKGROUND: Vaccines are a new combat strategy against COVID-19. The success of a large number of vaccines and the continued development of vaccines will change the course of the current pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions caused by the administration of inactive vaccine administration on healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The prospective study was conducted among healthcare professionals working in city a Training and Research Hospital and applied to have the second dose of CoronaVac vaccine. The number of personnel included in the study were 329. The data were recorded in the SPSS 23 program and the chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The average age of the participants in the study was 35.77+/-9.07. Of the participants, 28.1%were physicians. The frequency ratio of those who stated that they had serious adverse reactions after vaccination was 33.2%. Three most common systemic serious adverse reactions were headache, state of sleep/fatigue, and nausea and vomiting respectively. Serious adverse reactions occurred within 1.14+/-04 days after vaccine administration. The average duration of serious adverse reactions was determined as 1.68+/-0.77 days. 62.2%of the participants with serious side effects were women (p < 0.001). Of the participants who had serious adverse reactions, 77.5%were health care professionals (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: No life-threatening serious adverse reaction was determined regarding the CoronaVac vaccine administered in this study. However, local serious adverse reactions, nausea/vomiting, fever and sleepiness/fatigue occurred frequently. Further studies are required on the newly introduced vaccine.	Treatment
34219847	"In the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 and fresh fruits and vegetables: The fake and hidden transmission risks. From the first notification reporting to the WHO a cluster of coronavirus in Wuhan City (China), over 114 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been confirmed, with more than 2,530,000 deaths, and over 400,000 new cases and 10,000 deaths daily. Numerous viruses are susceptible to contaminate crops during growth, harvesting, handling, marketing and minimally processing, and these steps share one common factor which is human. Different studies showed that viruses might persist on different crops for periods of 2 to 14 days under different conditions such as refrigeration, household and freezing. Little is known on SARS-CoV-2, but preliminary studies showed that this virus might survive 24 hr on cardboard and 72 hr on plastic, materials used in fruits and vegetables packaging. Based on preliminary data, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Certainly, to date there is no scientific evidence that SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted by a contact with, or the ingestion of contaminated fresh or minimally processed fruits and vegetables. However, this risk even though being considered improbable, it cannot be ""completely and definitely"" discarded or ignored, particularly where the virus is spreading in the word. Some agencies indicated that in case some commodities and handlers are contaminated among the multiple people involved from the farm to the table, a cross-contamination may occur, and the risk of the contamination of food, food contact materials, and packaging from infected but asymptomatic workers should not be discarded even though considered ""Very Low = meaning very rare but cannot be excluded."""

34198410	A closer look at the spreaders of COVID-19 in Wisconsin and the US. In this study, we design and use a mathematical model to primarily address the question of who are the main drivers of COVID-19 - the symptomatic infectious or the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious in the state of Wisconsin and the entire United States. To set the stage, we first briefly simulate and illustrate the benefit of lockdown. With these lockdown scenarios, and in general, the more dominant influence of the the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious over the symptomatic infectious, is shown in various ways. Numerical simulations for the U.S. show that an increase in testing and isolating for the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group has up to 4 times more impact than an increase in testing for the symptomatic infectious in terms of cumulative deaths. An increase in testing for the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group also has significantly more impact (on the order of twice as much) on reducing the control reproduction number than testing for symptomatic infectious. Lastly, we use our model to simulate an implementation of a natural herd immunity strategy for the entire U.S. and for the state of Wisconsin (once an epicenter for COVID-19). These simulations provide specific examples confirming that such a strategy requires a significant number of deaths before immunity is achieved, and as such, this strategy is certainly questionable in terms of success.

34206727	Case Study of Two Post Vaccination SARS-CoV-2 Infections with P1 Variants in CoronaVac Vaccinees in Brazil. The rapid development of efficacious and safe vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been instrumental in mitigating the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Moreover, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants raised concerns on the efficacy of these vaccines. Herein, we report two cases of breakthrough infections with the P1 variant in patients vaccinated with CoronaVac, which is one of the two vaccines authorized for emergency use in the Brazilian immunization program. Our observations suggest that the vaccine reduced the severity of the disease and highlight the potential risk of illness following vaccination and subsequent infection with the P1 variant as well as for continued efforts to prevent and diagnose infection in vaccinated persons.

34227914	COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Zambia: a glimpse at the possible challenges ahead for COVID-19 vaccination rollout in sub-Saharan Africa. With unprecedented speed, multiple vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic was first identified. As we push to achieve global control through these new vaccines, old challenges present themselves, including cold-chain storage, the logistics of mass vaccination, and vaccine hesitancy. Understanding how much hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines might occur and what factors may be driving these concerns can improve the ability of public health workers and communicators to maximize vaccine uptake. We nested a survey within a measles-rubella mass vaccination campaign in Zambia in November 2020 and asked about sentiments and beliefs toward COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Among parents bringing their children to receive a measles-rubella vaccine, we found high acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination of their children, but substantial uncertainty and hesitancy about receiving the vaccine themselves. COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy was correlated with beliefs around COVID-19 severity and risk, as well as vaccine safety and effectiveness.	Prevention
34218641	Association between Dementia and Clinical Outcome after COVID-19: A Nationwide Cohort Study with Propensity Score Matched Control in South Korea. OBJECTIVE: Despite a high prevalence of dementia in older adults hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (SARS-CoV-2), or so called COVID-19, research investigating association between preexisting diagnoses of dementia and prognosis of COVID-19 is scarce. We aimed to investigate treatment outcome of patients with dementia after COVID-19. METHODS: We explored a nationwide cohort with a total of 2,800 subjects older than 50 years who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between January and April 2020. Among them, 223 patients had underlying dementia (dementia group). We matched 1:1 for each dementia- non-dementia group pair yielding 223 patients without dementia (no dementia group) using propensity score matching. RESULTS: Mortality rate after COVID-19 was higher in dementia group than in no dementia group (33.6% vs. 20.2%, p=0.002). Dementia group had higher proportion of patients requiring invasive ventilatory support than no dementia group (34.1% vs. 22.0%, p=0.006). Multivariable analysis showed that dementia group had a higher risk of mortality than no dementia group (odds ratio=3.05, p<0.001). We also found that patients in dementia group had a higher risk of needing invasive ventilatory support than those in no dementia group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that system including strengthen quarantines are required for patients with dementia during the COVID- 19 pandemic.	Diagnosis;Prevention;Treatment
34358460	Long-term SARS-CoV-2-specific immune and inflammatory responses in individuals recovering from COVID-19 with and without post-acute symptoms. We describe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cell responses, soluble markers of inflammation, and antibody levels and neutralization capacity longitudinally in 70 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants represent a spectrum of illness and recovery, including some with persistent viral shedding in saliva and many experiencing post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). T cell responses remain stable for up to 9 months. Whereas the magnitude of early CD4(+) T cell immune responses correlates with severity of initial infection, pre-existing lung disease is independently associated with higher long-term SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8(+) T cell responses. Among participants with PASC 4 months following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptom onset, we observe a lower frequency of CD8(+) T cells expressing CD107a, a marker of degranulation, in response to Nucleocapsid (N) peptide pool stimulation, and a more rapid decline in the frequency of N-specific interferon-gamma-producing CD8(+) T cells. Neutralizing antibody levels strongly correlate with SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4(+) T cell responses.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Treatment
34209552	Peripheral Artery Disease and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: The Forgotten Diseases in COVID-19 Pandemic. Results from an Observational Study on Real-World Management. Background and Objectives: It is well established that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) as well abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) have an increased cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Despite this higher risk, PAD and AAA patients are often suboptimality treated. This study assessed the CV profile of PAD and AAA patients, quantifying the survival benefits of target-based risk-factors modification even in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: PAD and AAA patients admitted for any reason to the Vascular Unit from January 2019 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Biochemical and CV profiles as well as ongoing medical therapies were recorded. Benefits of CV risk-factors control were estimated using the SMART-REACH model. A follow-up visit during the year 2020 was scheduled. Results: A total of 669 patients were included. Of these, 190 showed AAA and 479 PAD at any stage. Only 54% of PAD and 41% of AAA patients were on lipid-lowering drugs with non-optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels for most of them. A better control of all modifiable CV risk-factors based on the current guidelines would offer an absolute risk reduction of the mean 10-year CV risk by 9% in PAD and 14% in AAA. Unfortunately, the follow-up visit was lost because of COVID-19 limitations. Conclusions: Lipid profiles of PAD and AAA patients were far from guideline-based targets, and medical management was suboptimal. In our center, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted on the strict surveillance required in these very high-risk patients. The achievement of guideline-based therapeutic targets would definitively confer additional significant benefits in reducing the CV risk in these patients.	Prevention;Treatment
34132208	How can we manage the COVID-19 infodemics? A case study targeted to health workers in Italy. INTRODUCTION: The Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS) has been asked for rapid technical and scientific advice to the State and Regions during Sars-CoV-2 pandemic preparedness. METHODS: An ad hoc Working Group on Scientific Literature updates (WG SL) was set up at ISS (March-May 2020) to screen pre-prints and peer reviewed papers from arXiv, medRxiv, bioRxiv, and Pubmed to provide a real time knowledge and empirical evidence addressed to health-workers. RESULTS: The WG SL screened a total of 4,568 pre-prints and 15,590 peer reviewed papers, delivered as daily summary report of pre-print selection for ISS President activity in the National Scientific Technical Committee framework and a weekly open access publication (COVID Contents) on peer-reviewed papers of interest for health professionals, monitored by a satisfaction questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Promoting heath literacy, with a cross-cutting approach is a powerful heritage of Public Health Institutes and a proven effective non pharmacological intervention.	Prevention
34350584	Successful treatment of COVID-19 infection with convalescent plasma in B cell-depleted patients may promote cellular immunity. Treatment with convalescent plasma has been shown to be safe in COVID-19 infection, although efficacy reported in immunocompetent patients varies. Nevertheless, neutralizing antibodies are a key requisite in the fight against viral infections. Patients depleted of antibody-producing B cells, such as those treated with rituximab (anti-CD20) for haematological malignancies, lack a fundamental part of their adaptive immunity. Treatment with convalescent plasma appears to be of general benefit in this particularly vulnerable cohort. We analysed clinical course and inflammation markers of three B-cell depleted patients suffering from COVID-19 that were treated with convalescent plasma. In addition, we measured serum antibody levels as well as peripheral blood CD38/HLA-DR positive T-cells ex vivo and CD137 positive T-cells after in vitro stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides in these patients. We observed that therapy with convalescent plasma was effective in all three patients and analysis of CD137 positive T-cells after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptides showed an increase in peptide-specific T-cells after application of convalescent plasma. In conclusion, we here demonstrate efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in three B cell-depleted patients and present data that suggests that while application of convalescent plasma elevates systemic antibody levels only transiently, it may also boost specific T cell responses.

34289382	Is Mucormycosis an inevitable complication of Covid-19 in India? Mucormycosis or black fungus infection is a less common disease but highly fatal infection, infecting the immunocompromised individuals. The site of predilection of the fungus is found to be lungs and brain in addition to its sequestration in sinusoidal spaces. Presently with the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic, the prevalence of this infection is found to be high in the Indian population. The fungus establishes itself by affecting the compromised immune system of an individual and thereby making the individual susceptible to other diseases/infection. The reasons attributed to the sudden upsurge are steroidal therapeutics abuse, tocilizumab therapy and diabetes mellitus.To avert the cytokine storm, the medical health workers are necessitated to include steroid drugs in COVID 19 treatment protocol however inclusion of these drugs in patients who do essentially require steroids can have their immune system debilitated and permit the invasion of this fungus. According to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), 77 million Indians are known to be diabetic, cautioning the physicians to be vigilante of the impending black fungus infection in the event of COVID19 affliction in such individuals. There is causal relationship between anti-hyperglycemic drugs and weakened immune system and opportunity for the fungus invasion. This review attempts to explain the inter-relatedness of COVID19 infection, its treatment and eventual black fungus infection risk.	Treatment
34290526	Knowledge, Attitude and Practice Toward Corona virus Infection Among Pregnant Women Attending Antenatal Care at Public Hospitals in Three Wollega Zones, Ethiopia. Background: Pregnancy is an immune-suppressed state which makes pregnant women generally more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and severe illness. Extensive precautions have been recommended to avoid exposure to the virus. Knowledge and attitude toward the disease play an integral role in readiness to accept public health measures. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19 among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in three Wollega zones, Ethiopia. Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional study was employed among 415 pregnant women attending antenatal care at public hospitals in three Wollega zones, Ethiopia from July to August 2020. The data were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. The level of knowledge was assessed using 12 multiple choice questions; the score of above or equal to mean was considered as adequate knowledge. Binary logistic regression was performed and the adjusted odds ratio with P-value </=0.05 at 95% CI was taken as statistically significant. Results: This study indicates that more than two-thirds (75.4%; 95% CI: 71.1-79.3%) and 43.6% of the pregnant women had adequate knowledge and good practice about the coronavirus pandemic, respectively. The pregnant women who attended secondary school and above and were urban residents were more likely to have good knowledge, AOR = 2.99 (1.7-5.0) and 1.6 (1.2-2.7), respectively. Maternal age </= 25 yearsand being an urban resident were the two predictors of good practice of preventive measures, AOR = 1.7 (1.2-2.6) and 2.3 (1.3-4.0), respectively. Conclusions and Recommendations: The target population demonstrated acceptable knowledge and poor practice toward COVID-19. Health-care providers should give more attention to educating pregnant women at any point of contact; legal enforcement should be implemented to improve practice of preventive measures. Special consideration should be given to those who are from rural areas, and to less-educated pregnant women.	Prevention
34368503	Impact of poor disease surveillance system on COVID-19 response in africa: Time to rethink and rebuilt. Infectious disease outbreaks have long posed a public health threat, especially in Africa, where the incidence of infectious outbreaks has risen exponentially. Although, Africa has witnessed several outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola virus disease and other epidemic-prone diseases, little attention has been given towards strengthening the health surveillance systems. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the region's already due to inefficient and ineffective health surveillance systems. However, the impact posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on health systems in the region has been catastrophic, it has also stressed the importance of rethinking and focusing on lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we examine how Africa's poor disease surveillance systems affected the responses and strategies aimed at COVID-19 containment. To ensure early disease outbreak identification and prompt public health interventions in Africa, the current disease surveillance and response mechanisms must be strengthened.	Prevention
34218753	Clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 patients with history of heart failure: a propensity score-matched study. BACKGROUND: Data on the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 disease among patients with a history of heart failure (HF) are scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical characteristics, prognostic biomarkers and in-hospital outcomes of patients with a history of HF hospitalised with confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 8321 consecutive patients hospitalised with suspected COVID-19 disease were screened. Furthermore, 3849 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the study. Two hundred and forty COVID-19 patients with a history of HF and 240 without HF paired with PSM were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean age was 72.7 +/- 9.90 years, and 64.6% were men. Oxygen saturation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure at admission were significantly lower and heart rate was significantly higher in patients with a history of HF compared to those without. Patients with HF, compared to those without, had significantly higher leukocyte count, D-dimer, CRP, procalcitonin, hsTnI, lactate and lower albumin and lymphocyte. Compared with patients without HF, those with previous HF had a longer length of stay at ICU (6.22 d vs. 3.71 d; p < 0.001), increased risk of mechanical ventilation (42.1% vs. 15.4%; p < 0.001), in-hospital death (39.2% vs. 15.4%; p < 0.001) and composite outcomes (52.9% vs. 17.1%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: History of HF is associated with a higher risk of mechanical ventilation, cardiogenic shock, mortality and longer ICU stay in patients hospitalised for COVID-19, therefore the diagnosis of HF alone is important for predicting clinical outcomes.

34224465	Immune thrombocytopenia: options and new perspectives. Immune thrombocytopenia is a haematological, autoimmune disorder characterized by elevated platelet demolition due to the presence of antiplatelet autoantibodies derived from B cells and to an irregular, deficient process of platelets production in bone marrow. In this review, after a brief presentation of 'old' strategies used nowadays yet, we focused on new drugs used in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia and their mechanism of action and posology, basing on the last scientific literature. The observation that CoViD-19 can be associated with immune thrombocytopenia is also put in evidence. Particular attention will be dedicated on the concept that the ideal treatment should represent a solution not only for the failure of normal processes of production and survival of platelets, but also it should improve quality of life of patients, with minimum adverse events. Anyway, despite enormous advances of the last years, further investigations are necessary in order to define scrupulously long-term efficacy of new molecules proposed.	Treatment;Mechanism
34332917	Tomographic score (RAD-Covid Score) to assess the clinical severity of the novel coronavirus infection. OBJECTIVES: The severity of pulmonary Covid-19 infection can be assessed by the pattern and extent of parenchymal involvement observed in computed tomography (CT), and it is important to standardize the analysis through objective, practical, and reproducible systems. We propose a method for stratifying the radiological severity of pulmonary disease, the Radiological Severity Score (RAD-Covid Score), in Covid-19 patients by quantifying infiltrate in chest CT, including assessment of its accuracy in predicting disease severity. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study analyzed patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 infection by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, who underwent chest CT at hospital admission between March 6 and April 6, 2020. CT scans were classified as positive, negative, or equivocal, and a radiological severity score (RAD-Covid Score) was assigned. Clinical severity was also assessed upon hospital admission. RESULTS: 658 patients were included. Agreement beyond chance (kappa statistic) for the RAD-Covid Score was almost perfect among observers (0.833), with an overall agreement of 89.5%. The RAD-Covid Score was positively correlated with clinical severity and death, i.e., the higher the RAD-Covid Score, the greater the clinical severity and mortality. This association proved independent of age and comorbidities. Accuracy of this score was 66.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The RAD-Covid Score showed good accuracy in predicting clinical severity at hospital admission and mortality in patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection and was an independent predictor of severity.

34349859	Scalp Leiomyosarcoma: Diagnosis and Treatment During a Global Pandemic With COVID-19. Leiomyosarcoma is an aggressive, uncommon sarcoma effecting smooth muscle tissue. Prompt tissue diagnosis and staging workup are keys to preventing distant metastasis. Identification of this rare sarcoma has become increasingly difficult with decreased ability to seek out non-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) medical care. The pandemic has caused a widespread healthcare demand with providers reaching their full capacity causing care and resources to be shifted to the pandemic. We have experienced an 83-year-old male who significantly delayed to seek any medical attention for his scalp lesion for several months due to a combination of fear and decreased available appointments. Since the patient presented with a delayed scalp leiomyosarcoma, he required an extensive excision and flap reconstruction for the lesion. This case sheds light on the importance of weighing the risks and benefits associated with cancer management during the pandemic for both patients and healthcare providers. The healthcare system's response to the pandemic also played a role in this case as well, with shorter appointment times and decreased frequency of follow-up. As a result, the pandemic has had a catastrophic impact on the diagnostic pathway for cancer. This case report discusses the difficulties in diagnosing and treating a rare cancer such as scalp leiomyosarcoma amidst the global pandemic and the importance of telemedicine in improving future outcomes.

34207055	microRNA Heterogeneity, Innate-Immune Defense and the Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 Infection-A Commentary. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the genus Betacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, possesses an unusually large single-stranded viral RNA (ssvRNA) genome of about ~29,811 nucleotides (nt) that causes severe and acute respiratory distress and a highly lethal viral pneumonia known as COVID-19. COVID-19 also presents with multiple ancillary systemic diseases and often involves cardiovascular, inflammatory, and/or neurological complications. Pathological viral genomes consisting of ssvRNA, like cellular messenger RNA (mRNA), are susceptible to attack, destruction, neutralization, and/or modulation by naturally occurring small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) within the host cell, some of which are known as microRNAs (miRNAs). This paper proposes that the actions of the 2650 known human miRNAs and other sncRNAs form the basis for an under-recognized and unappreciated innate-immune regulator of ssvRNA viral genome activities and have implications for the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 invasion, infection, and replication. Recent research indicates that both miRNA and mRNA abundance, speciation, and complexity varies widely amongst human individuals, and this may: (i) In part explain the variability in the innate-immune immunological and pathophysiological response of different human individuals to the initiation and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple tissue types; and (ii) further support our understanding of human biochemical and genetic individuality and the variable resistance of individuals to ssvRNA-mediated viral infection and disease. This commentary will briefly address current findings and concepts in this fascinating research area of non-coding RNA and innate-immunity with special reference to natural host miRNAs, SARS-CoV-2, and the current COVID-19 pandemic.

34281428	Evaluation of Rocuronium Continuous Infusion in Critically Ill Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Drug Shortages. Background: Limited data exist to support the use of rocuronium continuous infusions in the intensive care unit (ICU). Objective: To evaluate the dosing and monitoring of adult patients who received rocuronium for hypoxemic respiratory failure during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center study from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. We identified all adult patients admitted to any ICU who received rocuronium via continuous infusion. Patients were excluded if they received rocuronium for <6 hours. The main outcome of this study was to determine the median rocuronium maintenance continuous infusion rate in the ICU. Secondary outcomes of this study included the initial continuous infusion rate, duration of therapy, cumulative dose, frequency and median of rocuronium boluses, time to resolution of neuromuscular blockade, and the relationship between the hourly administration rates of rocuronium and train-of-four (TOF) assessments. Results: Seventy-one patients and 97 paralytic infusions were included. Fifty-nine patients (83%) were positive for SARS CoV-2. Of the 97 rocuronium infusions, the median dose at initiation was 3 (3-5) mcg/kg/min and duration of infusion was 45 (23.6-92.5) hours. The median continuous infusion maintenance rate was 4.3 (2.8-7.2) mcg/kg/min. There was a negligible correlation between the dose of rocuronium and the TOF results (r = .04). A total of 1775 TOFs were assessed, of which 46.2% were over-paralyzed, 35.7% well-paralyzed, and 18.1% under-paralyzed. Conclusions: The initial and maintenance infusion doses in our analysis were lower than what have been previously referenced.	Treatment
34219966	COVID-19 discrimination framework for X-ray images by considering radiomics, selective information, feature ranking, and a novel hybrid classifier. In medical imaging procedures for the detection of coronavirus, apart from medical tests, approval of diagnosis has special significance. Imaging procedures are also useful for detecting the damage caused by COVID-19. Chest X-ray imaging is frequently used to diagnose COVID-19 and different pneumonias. This paper presents a task-specific framework to detect coronavirus in X-ray images. Binary classification of three different labels (healthy, bacterial pneumonia, and COVID-19) was performed on two differentiated data sets in which corona is stated as positive. First-order statistics, gray level co-occurrence matrix, gray level run length matrix, and gray level size zone matrix were analyzed to form fifteen sub-data sets and to ascertain the necessary radiomics. Two normalization methods are compared to make the data meaningful. Furthermore, five feature ranking approaches (Bhattacharyya, entropy, Roc, t-test, and Wilcoxon) are mentioned to provide necessary information to a state-of-the-art classifier based on Gauss-map-based chaotic particle swarm optimization and neural networks. The proposed framework was designed according to the analyses about radiomics, normalization approaches, and filter-based feature ranking methods. In experiments, seven metrics were evaluated to objectively determine the results: accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, g-mean, precision, and f-measure. The proposed framework showed promising scores on two X-ray-based data sets, especially with the accuracy and area under the ROC curve rates exceeding 99% for the classification of coronavirus vs. others.

34218309	Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of otitis media with effusion in adults and children: a multicenter study. PURPOSE: To compare and analyze the incidence of otitis media with effusion (OME), before and during the COVID-19-related pandemic period, to evaluate the effects of the social changes (lockdown, continuous use of facial masks, social distancing, reduction of social activities) in the OME incidence in children and adults. METHODS: The number of diagnosed OME in e five referral centers, between 1 March 2018 and 1 March 2021, has been reviewed and collected. To estimate the reduction of OME incidence in children and adults during the COVID-19 pandemic period the OME incidence in three period of time were evaluated and compared: group 1-patients with OME diagnosis achieved between 1/03/2018 and 01/03/2019 (not pandemic period). Group 2-patients with OME diagnosis achieved between 1/03/2019 and 1/03/2020 (not pandemic period). Group 3-patients with OME diagnosis achieved between 1/03/2020 and 1/03/2021 (COVID-19 pandemic period). RESULTS: In the non-pandemic periods (group 1 and 2), the incidence of OME in the five referral centers considered was similar, with 482 and 555 diagnosed cases, respectively. In contrast, the OME incidence in the same centers, during the pandemic period (group 3) was clearly reduced with a lower total number of 177 cases of OME estimated. Percentage variation in OME incidence between the first non-pandemic year considered (group 1) and the pandemic period (group 3) was-63, 3%, with an absolute value decrease value of-305 cases. Similarly, comparing the second non-pandemic year (group 2) and the pandemic year (group 3) the percentage variation of OME incidence was-68, 1% with an absolute value of-305 cases decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed a lower incidence of OME during the pandemic period compared with 2 previous non pandemic years. The drastic restrictive anti-contagion measures taken by the Italian government to contain the spread of COVID-19 could have had a positive impact on the lower OME incidence during the last pandemic year.

34292122	The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health-related quality of life in home-based patients with spinal cord injuries in Japan. CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced people to maintain social distance and to refrain from going out. As a result, home-based patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI) are not only less able to go out, but they may have difficulty in easily receiving long-term care services. There are concerns that their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) may have deteriorated. We aimed to clarify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on HRQOL in home-based patients with SCI.In June 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was finally settling down in Japan, we conducted a mail survey of 266 patients with SCI regarding changes in the frequency of going out, the long-term care services, and their HRQOL due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They had all been discharged from our hospital (Rehabilitation medical center) by 2019, and were expected to be living at home. We received answers from 135 patients about their HRQOL. FINDINGS: Respondent characteristics indicated that many of them were elderly (74.1% were over 60 years of age) and many had cervical SCI (70.5%). Worsened HRQOL since the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was reported by 40% of respondents. The most commonly reported dimension was pain/discomfort. Significantly, many had been injured comparatively recently and had reduced frequency of going out and receiving home-visit nursing or rehabilitation services than patients whose HRQOL was unchanged. CONCLUSION/ CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study clarifies the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on HRQOL in home-based patients with SCI. Many respondents had worsened HRQOL, in particular pain/discomfort. It was suggested that the decrease in the frequency of going out may be one of the factors that affected the deterioration of their HRQOL.	Prevention

Aim: We investigated the effect of pre-analytical sample handling variations on coronavirus disease 2019-relevant circulating cytokine levels IFN-gamma, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Materials & methods: We collected blood in different collection tubes (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, sodium citrate, lithium heparin, serum), and subjected ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma to among others increasing delays in centrifugation or -80 degrees C storage. Six subjects were included in each experimental condition. Cytokine levels were measured in these samples using the Simoa Cytokine 6-plex kit. Results: Different tube types resulted in different blood cytokine levels. IL-17A and IL-6 levels declined with 3 h centrifugation delay. IFN-gamma levels declined with 24 h postcentrifugation storage delay. IL-17A levels declined with 2-week storage delay. Conclusion: It is recommended to centrifuge tubes quickly following collection, for accurate cytokine measurement.	Diagnosis
34219448	SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine Induces a Strong Neutralizing Immunity in Preclinical Studies. Controlling the global COVID-19 pandemic depends, among other measures, on developing preventive vaccines at an unprecedented pace. Vaccines approved for use and those in development intend to elicit neutralizing antibodies to block viral sites binding to the host's cellular receptors. Virus infection is mediated by the spike glycoprotein trimer on the virion surface via its receptor binding domain (RBD). Antibody response to this domain is an important outcome of immunization and correlates well with viral neutralization. Here, we show that macromolecular constructs with recombinant RBD conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT) induce a potent immune response in laboratory animals. Some advantages of immunization with RBD-TT conjugates include a predominant IgG immune response due to affinity maturation and long-term specific B-memory cells. These result demonstrate the potential of the conjugate COVID-19 vaccine candidates and enable their advance to clinical evaluation under the name SOBERANA02, paving the way for other antiviral conjugate vaccines.

34203435	"Man-Specific Lectins from Plants, Fungi, Algae and Cyanobacteria, as Potential Blockers for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Coronaviruses: Biomedical Perspectives. Betacoronaviruses, responsible for the ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome"" (SARS) and the ""Middle East Respiratory Syndrome"" (MERS), use the spikes protruding from the virion envelope to attach and subsequently infect the host cells. The coronavirus spike (S) proteins contain receptor binding domains (RBD), allowing the specific recognition of either the dipeptidyl peptidase CD23 (MERS-CoV) or the angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE2 (SARS-Cov, SARS-CoV-2) host cell receptors. The heavily glycosylated S protein includes both complex and high-mannose type N-glycans that are well exposed at the surface of the spikes. A detailed analysis of the carbohydrate-binding specificity of mannose-binding lectins from plants, algae, fungi, and bacteria, revealed that, depending on their origin, they preferentially recognize either complex type N-glycans, or high-mannose type N-glycans. Since both complex and high-mannose glycans substantially decorate the S proteins, mannose-specific lectins are potentially useful glycan probes for targeting the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 virions. Mannose-binding legume lectins, like pea lectin, and monocot mannose-binding lectins, like snowdrop lectin or the algal lectin griffithsin, which specifically recognize complex N-glycans and high-mannose glycans, respectively, are particularly adapted for targeting coronaviruses. The biomedical prospects of targeting coronaviruses with mannose-specific lectins are wide-ranging including detection, immobilization, prevention, and control of coronavirus infection."

34207560	Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Develop a Clinical Decision-Making Tool for COVID-19 Inpatients. BACKGROUND: Within the UK, COVID-19 has contributed towards over 103,000 deaths. Although multiple risk factors for COVID-19 have been identified, using this data to improve clinical care has proven challenging. The main aim of this study is to develop a reliable, multivariable predictive model for COVID-19 in-patient outcomes, thus enabling risk-stratification and earlier clinical decision-making. METHODS: Anonymised data consisting of 44 independent predictor variables from 355 adults diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient records for retrospective, case-control analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, required ventilatory support, and duration of inpatient treatment. Pulmonary embolism sequala was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were then learned and constructed using Bayesian networks. RESULTS: The proposed probabilistic models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of the mentioned outcomes. Overall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable, quantitative predictive models for four outcomes, which utilise readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients. Further research is required to externally validate our models and demonstrate their utility as risk stratification and clinical decision-making tools.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34287009	Amplicon and Metagenomic Analysis of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus and the Microbiome in Patients with Severe MERS. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic infection that emerged in the Middle East in 2012. Symptoms range from mild to severe and include both respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses. The virus is mainly present in camel populations with occasional zoonotic spill over into humans. The severity of infection in humans is influenced by numerous factors, and similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underlying health complications can play a major role. Currently, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are coincident in the Middle East and thus a rapid way of sequencing MERS-CoV to derive genotype information for molecular epidemiology is needed. Additionally, complicating factors in MERS-CoV infections are coinfections that require clinical management. The ability to rapidly characterize these infections would be advantageous. To rapidly sequence MERS-CoV, an amplicon-based approach was developed and coupled to Oxford Nanopore long read length sequencing. This and a metagenomic approach were evaluated with clinical samples from patients with MERS. The data illustrated that whole-genome or near-whole-genome information on MERS-CoV could be rapidly obtained. This approach provided data on both consensus genomes and the presence of minor variants, including deletion mutants. The metagenomic analysis provided information of the background microbiome. The advantage of this approach is that insertions and deletions can be identified, which are the major drivers of genotype change in coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in late 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The virus is a serious threat to people not only in the Middle East but also in the world and has been detected in over 27 countries. MERS-CoV is spreading in the Middle East and neighboring countries, and approximately 35% of reported patients with this virus have died. This is the most severe coronavirus infection so far described. Saudi Arabia is a destination for many millions of people in the world who visit for religious purposes (Umrah and Hajj), and so it is a very vulnerable area, which imposes unique challenges for effective control of this epidemic. The significance of our study is that clinical samples from patients with MERS were used for rapid in-depth sequencing and metagenomic analysis using long read length sequencing.	Mechanism

34228815	Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma with marked spontaneous regression of organ manifestation after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) belongs to the primary cutaneous CD30+ T cell lymphoproliferative disorders.(1) Systemic involvement is relatively rare and rather confined to the regional lymph nodes.(1) We describe a patient with recurrent pcALCL and diffuse lung manifestation which spontaneously regressed after one SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. We report a 57-year-old male patient with a 10-year history of biopsy-proven (CD30+, CD3+, CD4+, ALK-, clonal T cell receptor gamma chain rearrangement) pcALCL with frequent local relapses predominantly affecting his scalp and neck.

34281001	Disinfection of Neonatal Resuscitation Equipment in Low-Resource Settings: The Importance, the Reality, and Considerations for the Future. Preventable neonatal deaths due to prematurity, perinatal events, and infections are the leading causes of under-five mortality. The vast majority of these deaths are in resource-limited areas. Deaths due to infection have been associated with lack of access to clean water, overcrowded nurseries, and improper disinfection (reprocessing) of equipment, including vital resuscitation equipment. Reprocessing has recently come to heightened attention, with the COVID-19 pandemic bringing this issue to the forefront across all economic levels; however, it is particularly challenging in low-resource settings. In 2015, Eslami et al. published a letter to the editor in Resuscitation, highlighting concerns about the disinfection of equipment being used to resuscitate newborns in Kenya. To address the issue of improper disinfection, the global health nongovernment organization PATH gathered a group of experts and, due to lack of best-practice evidence, published guidelines with recommendations for reprocessing of neonatal resuscitation equipment in low-resource areas. The guidelines follow the gold-standard principle of high-level disinfection; however, there is ongoing concern that the complexity of the guideline would make feasibility and sustainability difficult in the settings for which it was designed. Observations from hospitals in Kenya and Malawi reinforce this concern. The purpose of this review is to discuss why proper disinfection of equipment is important, why this is challenging in low-resource settings, and suggestions for solutions to move forward.	Prevention
34200850	Epidemiological Significance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA Dynamic in Naso-Pharyngeal Swabs. From 16 March to 15 December 2020, 132,357 naso-pharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs were collected in the province of Teramo, Abruzzo Region, Italy, and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA by a commercially available molecular assay. A total of 12,880 swabs resulted positive. For 8212 positive patients (4.150 women and 4.062 men) the median age was statistically different between women (median: 49.55 +/- 23.9 of SD) and men (median: 48.35 +/- 23.5 of SD) while no differences were found in the comparison between the cycle threshold for the N protein-encoding gene (CT N) median values and gender. Differences were observed in the CT N gene median values of swabs collected from March to September as well as in the pairwise comparison between September and October and between November and December. The CT N gene median values observed in specific periods characterizing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in 2020 were also compared with the incidence of COVID-19 cases; a strong inverse correlation was highlighted (Pearson correlation coefficient = -0.978). Our findings confirm the usefulness of the CT N values as an indirect detection parameter to monitor viral loads in the population.	Diagnosis
34210738	Postinfection treatment with a protease inhibitor increases survival of mice with a fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continues to be a serious global public health threat. The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is a virus protease encoded by SARS-CoV-2, which is essential for virus replication. We have previously reported a series of small-molecule 3CLpro inhibitors effective for inhibiting replication of human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and in animal models. Here we generated a series of deuterated variants of a 3CLpro inhibitor, GC376, and evaluated the antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. The deuterated GC376 displayed potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the enzyme- and the cell-based assays. The K18-hACE2 mice develop mild to lethal infection commensurate with SARS-CoV-2 challenge doses and were proposed as a model for efficacy testing of antiviral agents. We treated lethally infected mice with a deuterated derivative of GC376. Treatment of K18-hACE2 mice at 24 h postinfection with a derivative (compound 2) resulted in increased survival of mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Lung virus titers were decreased, and histopathological changes were ameliorated in compound 2-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Structural investigation using high-resolution crystallography illuminated binding interactions of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with deuterated variants of GC376. Taken together, deuterated GC376 variants have excellent potential as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.	Mechanism;Treatment
34227075	COVID-19 in celiac disease: a multicentric retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder, characterized by increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections. Therefore, the CD patients could be exposed to an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, a virus for which the WHO declared a pandemic status in March 2020. This study aims to investigate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CD patients, to assess the impact of CD on the risk of contracting this virus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective multicentric cohort study evaluated 542 celiac patients, who answered a questionnaire concerning both the underlying disease (adherence to the gluten-free diet, residual symptoms) and the possible SARS-CoV-2 infection (swab outcome, presence and characteristics of symptoms and type of treatment received), referring to the period between 20th January 2020 and 27th October 2020. RESULTS: Five patients (0.92%) tested positive; of these, 2 were asymptomatic and 3 developed symptoms of COVID-19. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CD patients was not significantly different from the general population. The ratio of positive/diagnostic swabs tends to be higher in CD patients than in the general population (IR: 0.15; 0.06; p=0.06), whereas the number of subjects who performed the swab in this group is significantly lower (IR: 0.06; 0.15; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although CD patients are more susceptible to infections, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our sample was not significantly different from the general population. However, the positive/diagnostic swabs ratio seems to be higher, probably also due to the lower number of patients tested.	Diagnosis
34290525	Anaesthesia and Critical Care Department at a Major Academic Centre's Adaptation to Face the COVID-19 Pandemic. The new novel coronavirus is having a major impact on healthcare systems internationally. Hospitals are struggling to manage the sudden influx of critical patients. Anaesthesiologists and critical care physicians are front liners in the fight against COVID-19 and carry the highest risk of getting infected. Due to the rapid response of the Saudi government to the WHO's early warning, we were fortunate at our hospital to see a slower rise in COVID-19 cases allowing us some time to prepare. We had to make room for the expected rise in highly infectious and critical patients, while at the same time protecting non-COVID-19 patients, staff and trainees. Additionally, the team continued to provide essential and specialized care to all patients in the hospital and maintain its academic and non-clinical services within the university. This review presents the different protocols, challenges and lessons learned during the development of a COVID-19 anaesthesia and critical care department plan in a major teaching hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Our ultimate aim is to share our experience with other similar institutions.	Prevention
34211808	ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in a 23-Year-Old Female: The Mystery of Thrombus Formation. Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is rarely seen in young adults, however, when encountered, the underlying cause is either a genetic condition leading to early-onset coronary artery disease (CAD), an acquired pro-thrombotic condition, or an idiopathic condition like spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). Our case describes a healthy 23-year-old female who presented with sudden onset severe angina and was found to have a laminated thrombus in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), with no evidence of intraluminal dissection or plaque rupture. Although the underlying etiology of thrombus formation remains unknown, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related thrombotic event is the prime suspect. In addition, another culprit that cannot be excluded is phentermine-induced coronary vasospasm, a commercially available medication for weight loss. This report addresses current literature on acute coronary syndromes in young adults and reviews the potential etiologies for coronary artery thrombosis, which led to a near-fatal acute coronary syndrome in our patient.

34287893	COVID-19 Transmission during Transportation of 1st to 12th Grade Students: Experience of an Independent School in Virginia. BACKGROUND: In-school transmission of COVID-19 among K-12 students is low when mitigation layers are used, but the risk of acquiring COVID-19 during school bus transportation is not well defined. Given the operational limitations of many school districts, more data is needed to determine what mitigation is required to keep COVID-19 transmission low during bus transport. METHODS: An independent school in Virginia monitored 1154 students in grades 1 to 12 with asymptomatic PCR testing every 2 weeks from August 24, 2020 to March 19, 2021, during the highest community transmission. Fifteen buses served 462 students while operating at near capacity of 2 students in every seat, using a physical distancing minimum of 2.5 ft, universal masking, and simple ventilation techniques. RESULTS: A total of 39 individuals were present on buses during their COVID-19 infectious period, which resulted in the quarantine of 52 students. Universal testing and contact tracing revealed no transmission linked to bus transportation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a model for the safe operation of school buses while near capacity. COVID-19 transmission can be low during student transport when employing mitigation including simple ventilation, and universal masking, at minimal physical distances and during the highest community transmission.

34199612	Working during a Pandemic between the Risk of Being Infected and/or the Risks Related to Social Distancing: First Validation of the SAPH@W Questionnaire. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led the worldwide healthcare system to a severe crisis in which personnel paid the major costs. Many studies were promptly dedicated to the physical and psychological consequences of the COVID-19 exposure among healthcare employees, whereas the research on the other working populations has been substantially ignored. To bridge the current lack of knowledge about safe behaviors related to the risk of COVID-19 contagion at work, the aim of the study was to validate a new tool, the SAPH@W (Safety at Work), to assess workers' perceptions of safety. METHODS: A total of 1085 participants, employed in several organizations sited across areas with different levels of risk of contagion, completed an online questionnaire. To test the SAPH@W validity and measurement invariance, the research sample was randomly divided in two. RESULTS: In the first sub-sample, Confirmatory Factor Analysis demonstrated the adequacy of the SAPH@W factorial structure. In the second sub-sample, multi-group Confirmatory Factor Analysis revealed that the SAPH@W was invariant across gender, ecological risk level, and type of occupation (in-person vs. remote working). CONCLUSIONS: The study evidenced the psychometric properties of the SAPH@W, a brief tool to monitor workers' experiences and safety perceptions regarding the COVID-19 risk in any organisational setting.

34287223	Provider Perspectives on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Newborn Screening. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant changes in healthcare delivery. Telemedicine rapidly and unexpectedly became the primary vehicle for ambulatory management. As newborn screen (NBS) referrals require varying levels of acuity, whether telemedicine could be used as a safe and effective medium to return these results were unknown. We sent an online survey to metabolism providers internationally to investigate triage differences of abnormal NBS results during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey compared personal practice for the periods of March-June 2019 and March-June 2020. Responses were received from 44 providers practicing in 8 countries. Nearly all (93%) practiced in areas of widespread SARS-COV-2 community transmission during spring 2020. There was a significant expansion of telemedicine use for NBS referrals at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (OR: 12, 95% CI: 3.66-39.3, p < 0.0001). Telehealth primarily replaced in-person ambulatory metabolism visits. The increased frequency of virtual care was similar across NBS analytes. Providers found telehealth for NBS referral equally efficacious to in-person care. Institutional patient surveys showed no difference in satisfaction with provider communication, provider empathy, or appointment logistics. Our survey was limited by unprecedented disruption in healthcare delivery, necessitating further validation of telegenetics for NBS in the post-pandemic era. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate that telemedicine is potentially a viable and practical tool for triaging abnormal NBS results.	Prevention
34224033	Feasibility and utility of facemask sampling in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 during an ongoing pandemic. Easy access to screening for timely identification and isolation of infectious COVID-19 patients remains crucial in sustaining the international efforts to control COVID-19 spread. A major barrier limiting broad-based screening is the lack of a simple, rapid, and cost-effective COVID-19 testing method. We evaluated the feasibility and utility of facemask sampling in a cohort of 42 COVID-19-positive and 36 COVID-19-negative patients. We used a prototype of Steri-Strips (3 M) applied to the inner surface of looped surgical facemasks (Assure), which was worn by patients for a minimum wear time of 3 h, then removed and sent for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Baseline demographics and symptomatology were also collected. Facemask sampling positivity was highest within the first 5 days of symptomatic presentation. Patients with nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 PCR Ct values < 25.09 had SARS-CoV-2 detected on facemask sampling, while patients with Ct values >/= 25.2 had no SARS-CoV-2 detected on facemask sampling. Facemask sampling can identify patients with COVID-19 during the early symptomatic phase or those with high viral loads, hence allowing timely identification and isolation of those with the highest transmission risk. Given the widespread use of facemasks, this method can potentially be easily applied to achieve broad-based, or even continuous, population screening.	Diagnosis
34337269	Conformational Variability Correlation Prediction of Transmissibility and Neutralization Escape Ability for Multiple Mutation SARS-CoV-2 Strains using SSSCPreds. Identifying the fundamental cause of transmissibility of multiple mutation strains and vaccine nullification is difficult in general and is a source of significant concern. The conformational variability of the mutation sites for B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.617.1 (kappa), B.1.427/429 (epsilon), P.1 (gamma), B.1.351 (beta), B.1.1.7 (alpha), S477N, and the wild-type strain has been assessed using a deep neural-network-based prediction program of conformational flexibility or rigidity in proteins (SSSCPreds). We find that although the conformation of G614 is rigid, which is assigned as a left-handed (LH) alpha-helix-type one, that of D614 is flexible without the hydrogen bonding latch to T859. The rigidity of glycine, which stabilizes the local conformation more effectively than that of aspartic acid with the latch, thereby contributes to the reduction of S1 shedding, high expression, and increase in infectivity. The finding that the sequence flexibility/rigidity map pattern of B.1.1.7 is similar to that of the wild-type strain but is largely different from those of B.1.351 and P.1 correlates with the minor escape ability of B.1.1.7. The increased rigidity of the amino acid sequence YRYRLFR from the SSSCPreds data of B.1.427/429 near the L452R mutation site contributes to the 2-fold increased B.1.427/B.1.429 viral shedding in vivo and the increase in transmissibility relative to wild-type circulating strains in a similar manner to D614G. The concordance and rigidity ratios of multiple mutation strains such as B.1.617.2 against the wild-type one at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and receptor-binding motif (RBM) regions provide a good indication of the transmissibility and neutralization escape ability except for binding affinity of mutation sites such as N501Y.

34131052	Serum neurofilament light protein correlates with unfavorable clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Brain imaging studies of patients with COVID-19 show evidence of macro- and microhemorrhagic lesions, multifocal white matter hyperintensities, and lesions consistent with posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy. Imaging studies, however, are subject to selection bias, and prospective studies are challenging to scale. Here, we evaluated whether serum neurofilament light chain (NFL), a neuroaxonal injury marker, could predict the extent of neuronal damage in a cohort of 142 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. NFL was elevated in the serum of patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy controls, including those without overt neurological manifestations. Higher NFL serum concentrations were associated with worse clinical outcomes. In 100 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir, a trend toward lower NFL serum concentrations was observed. These data suggest that patients with COVID-19 may experience neuroaxonal injury and may be at risk for long-term neurological sequelae. Neuroaxonal injury should be considered as an outcome in acute pharmacotherapeutic trials for COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34227995	"Corona Contact Tracing Apps: Empirical Study on Self-Focused and Other-Focused Health Concerns as Predictors of App-Uptake. BACKGROUND: Corona contact tracing apps are a novel and promising measure to reduce the spread of COVID-19. They can help to balance the need to maintain normal life and economic activities as much as possible while still avoiding exponentially growing case numbers. However, a majority of citizens needs to be willing to install such an app for it to be effective. Hence, knowledge about drivers for app-uptake is crucial. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to add to our understanding of underlying psychological factors motivating app-uptake. More specifically, we investigated the role of concern for one's own health and concern to unknowingly infect others. METHODS: A two-wave survey with N = 346 German-speaking participants from Switzerland and Germany was conducted. We measured the uptake of two decentralized contact tracing apps officially launched by governments (""Corona-Warn-App"", Germany; ""SwissCovid"", Switzerland) as well as concerns regarding COVID-19 and control variables. RESULTS: While controlling for demographic variables as well as general attitudes towards the government and the pandemic, logistic regression analysis showed a significant effect of self-focused concerns (Odds Ratio = 1.64, P <.01). Meanwhile, concern to unknowingly infect others did not contribute significantly to the prediction of app-uptake over and above concern for one's own health (Odds Ratio = 1.01, P = .92). Longitudinal analyses replicated this pattern and showed no support for the possibility that app-uptake provokes changes in levels of concern. Testing for a curvilinear relationship, no evidence was found that ""too much"" concern leads to defensive reactions and reduces app-uptake. CONCLUSIONS: As one of the first studies to assess the installation of already launched corona tracing apps, our study extends our knowledge of the motivational landscape of app-uptake. Based on that, practical implications for communication strategies and app design are discussed. CLINICALTRIAL:"	Prevention
34349329	Elective Cesarean Section in Obstetric COVID-19 Patients under Spinal Anesthesia: A Prospective Study. Background: Managing obstetric emergencies in COVID-19 pandemic is a real challenge as these patients need timely intervention to save the life of the mother and the baby. Hence, to avoid life-threatening challenges, all pregnant patients were electively admitted and tested for COVID-19 near term to anticipate the difficulties and prevent complications. Aim: Our aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 infection on maternal morbidity and mortality as well as the effect on the neonate under spinal anesthesia. Settings and Design: This was a prospective observational study. Materials and Methods: One hundred and fifteen COVID-19-positive pregnant patients in the age group of 20-40 years from July 2020 to December 2020 were electively taken for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Patients who needed emergency cesarean delivery were excluded from the study. Emergency cesarean delivery was avoided to reduce the risk of aerosol generation under general anesthesia as endotracheal intubation of COVID-19 patients poses a significant risk of viral exposure to doctors and staff. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Spinal anesthesia was given at L4-L5 intervertebral space. Demographic parameters, anesthetic and surgical parameters, and neonatal parameters were observed. Any inadvertent event was noted. Statistical Analysis: Data were expressed as mean, median, percentage, or number. Results: All pregnancies were singleton. None of the patients was converted to general anesthesia. One hundred and ten were either mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic. Five of our patients had severe symptoms and needed intensive care unit care preoperatively and postoperatively. Seven patients developed spinal hypotension and were managed by vasopressors. No significant thrombocytopenia was noted in any of our patients. None of our patients developed symptomatic thromboembolism. Vertical transmission was not reported in any of the cases. All babies were born with weight >2500 g and good APGAR score. Conclusion: Spinal anesthesia for LSCS is safe and effective for obstetric anesthesia in COVID-19 both for the parturient and the newborn.	Prevention;Treatment
34216996	Opinions, beliefs and knowledge of people with multiple sclerosis on COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine. BACKGROUND: Considering the potential COVID-19 impact on pwMS health and the importance of vaccination for this population, we decided to assess: (a) pwMS' beliefs and knowledge on COVID-19 pandemic; (b) their acceptance towards COVID-19 vaccination and (c) pwMS' opinions on general vaccination. METHODS: Observational study, based on a cross-sectional (10-20(th) September 2020) online survey, conducted in a cohort of pwMS' followed at two Portuguese hospitals. The survey included measures to characterize the sample and a questionnaire designed to assess the topics defined for this study. RESULTS: 270 respondents completed the full survey (response rate 58.2%). pwMS greatest concern during the pandemic was an aggravation of MS, especially by patients older than 50 years old. Almost 40% of the patients older than 50 felt that the pandemic negatively affected their MS related medical assistance. Most patients believed they would recover from COVID-19 infection. More than half of the responders feared a MS aggravation if they got COVID-19; this was more pronounced in patients with progressive MS. About 12% of the participants did not want to be vaccinated and almost 40% was unsure. Regarding vaccines in general, almost a third of the participants feared their side effects or MS related complications. CONCLUSION: Having knowledge of pwMS' opinions on COVID-19 pandemic impact and vaccination is useful to better address these issues. Fears and expectations towards vaccination must be discussed with pwMS.	Prevention
34289344	A selective sweep in the Spike gene has driven SARS-CoV-2 human adaptation. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic underscores the need to better understand animal-to-human transmission of coronaviruses and adaptive evolution within new hosts. We scanned more than 182,000 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes for selective sweep signatures and found a distinct footprint of positive selection located around a non-synonymous change (A1114G; T372A) within the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), predicted to remove glycosylation and increase binding to human ACE2 (hACE2), the cellular receptor. This change is present in all human SARS-CoV-2 sequences but not in closely related viruses from bats and pangolins. As predicted, T372A RBD bound hACE2 with higher affinity in experimental binding assays. We engineered the reversion mutant (A372T) and found that A372 (wild-type [WT]-SARS-CoV-2) enhanced replication in human lung cells relative to its putative ancestral variant (T372), an effect that was 20 times greater than the well-known D614G mutation. Our findings suggest that this mutation likely contributed to SARS-CoV-2 emergence from animal reservoirs or enabled sustained human-to-human transmission.	Mechanism;Transmission
34199283	Ruthenium Complexes in the Fight against Pathogenic Microorganisms. An Extensive Review. The widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in the emergence of drug-resistant populations of microorganisms. Clearly, one can see the need to develop new, more effective, antimicrobial agents that go beyond the explored 'chemical space'. In this regard, their unique modes of action (e.g., reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, redox activation, ligand exchange, depletion of substrates involved in vital cellular processes) render metal complexes as promising drug candidates. Several Ru (II/III) complexes have been included in, or are currently undergoing, clinical trials as anticancer agents. Based on the in-depth knowledge of their chemical properties and biological behavior, the interest in developing new ruthenium compounds as antibiotic, antifungal, antiparasitic, or antiviral drugs has risen. This review will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Ru (II/III) frameworks as antimicrobial agents. Some aspects regarding the relationship between their chemical structure and mechanism of action, cellular localization, and/or metabolism of the ruthenium complexes in bacterial and eukaryotic cells are discussed as well.

34226759	Learning from deregulation: The asymmetric impact of lockdown and reopening on risky behavior during COVID-19. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, states issued and then rescinded stay-at-home orders that restricted mobility. We develop a model of learning by deregulation, which predicts that lifting stay-at-home orders can signal that going out has become safer. Using restaurant activity data, we find that the implementation of stay-at-home orders initially had a limited impact, but that activity rose quickly after states' reopenings. The results suggest that consumers inferred from reopening that it was safer to eat out. The rational, but mistaken inference that occurs in our model may explain why a sharp rise of COVID-19 cases followed reopening in some states.	Prevention
34212190	COVID-19 Experiences, PPE, and Health Concerns in Toronto, Canada Bicycle Delivery Workers: Cross-sectional Pilot Survey. OBJECTIVES: To pilot recruitment methods for bicycle delivery workers in Toronto, Canada and to assess workers' experiences with COVID-19 and personal protective equipment (PPE). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. An online survey was deployed and advertised via social media with both paid and free postings in July and August of 2020. An incentive draw was used to motivate participation. These analyses summarized descriptive statistics of the sample and variables relevant to COVID-19. RESULTS: Complete responses were received from 35 participants. No participants reported a diagnosis of COVID-19, however four participants indicated experiencing symptoms. Most participants reported they used PPE, especially masks and/or respirators (97.1%) and 71.4% of participants indicated their employer provided them with PPE (masks or gloves). Participants expressed concern about precarious work and uncertainty about their own COVID-19 exposure risk. CONCLUSIONS: Bicycle delivery workers are a precarious working population that may be difficult to reach for research recruitment purposes. Given their essential role in deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic, further work is needed to characterize exposures and risks in this population.	Prevention
34370410	Acute transverse myelitis after inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been rapidly developed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There is increasing safety concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines. We report a 78-year old woman who was presented with tetraparesis, paresthesias of bilateral upper extremities, and urinary retention of one-day duration. Three weeks before these symptoms, she was vaccinated with CoronaVAC vaccine (Sinovac Life Sciences, China). Spine magnetic resonance imaging showed longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (TM) from the C1 to the T3 spinal cord segment. An extensive diagnostic workup was performed to exclude other possible causes of TM. We suggest that longitudinally extensive TM may be associated with COVID-19 vaccination in this case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of longitudinally extensive TM developing after CoronaVac vaccination. Clinicians should be aware of neurological symptoms after vaccination of COVID-19.	Case Report
34216126	Nosocomial Outbreak of COVID-19 in a Hematologic Ward. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks occur in hospitals in many parts of the world. In hospital settings, the possibility of airborne transmission needs to be investigated thoroughly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There was a nosocomial outbreak of COVID-19 in a hematologic ward in a tertiary hospital, Seoul, Korea. We found 11 patients and guardians with COVID-19 through vigorous contact tracing and closed-circuit television monitoring. We found one patient who probably had acquired COVID-19 through airborne-transmission. We performed airflow investigation with simulation software, whole-genome sequencing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: Of the nine individuals with COVID-19 who had been in the hematologic ward, six stayed in one multi-patient room (Room 36), and other three stayed in different rooms (Room 1, 34, 35). Guardian in room 35 was close contact to cases in room 36, and patient in room 34 used the shared bathroom for teeth brushing 40 minutes after index used. Airflow simulation revealed that air was spread from the bathroom to the adjacent room 1 while patient in room 1 did not used the shared bathroom. Airflow was associated with poor ventilation in shared bathroom due to dysfunctioning air-exhaust, grill on the door of shared bathroom and the unintended negative pressure of adjacent room. CONCLUSION: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the hematologic ward occurred rapidly in the multi-patient room and shared bathroom settings. In addition, there was a case of possible airborne transmission due to unexpected airflow.	Prevention;Transmission
34222741	Longitudinal analysis of the utility of liver biochemistry in hospitalised COVID-19 patients as prognostic markers. Background & Aims: The association of liver biochemistry with clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently unclear and the utility of longitudinally-measured liver biochemistry as prognostic markers for mortality is unknown. We aimed to determine whether abnormal liver biochemistry, assessed at baseline and at repeat measures over time, was associated with death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 compared to those without COVID-19, in a UK population. Approach & Results: We extracted routinely collected clinical data from a large teaching hospital in the UK, matching 585 hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients to 1165 hospitalised RT-PCR-negative patients for age, gender, ethnicity and pre-existing comorbidities. 26.8% (157/585) of COVID-19 patients died, compared to 11.9% (139/1165) in the non-COVID-19 group (p<0.001). At presentation, a significantly higher proportion of the COVID-19 group had elevated alanine aminotransferase (20.7% vs. 14.6%, p=0.004) and hypoalbuminaemia (58.7% vs. 35.0%, p<0.001), compared to the non-COVID-19 group. Within the COVID-19 group, those with hypoalbuminaemia at presentation had 1.83-fold increased hazards of death compared to those with normal albumin (adjusted HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.25-2.67), whilst the hazard of death was ~4-fold higher in those aged >/=75 years (adjusted HR 3.96, 95% CI 2.59-6.04) and ~3-fold higher in those with pre-existing liver disease (adjusted HR 3.37, 95% CI 1.58-7.16). In the COVID-19 group, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased (R=0.192, p<0.0001) and albumin declined (R=-0.123, p=0.0004) over time in patients who died. Conclusion: In this UK population, liver biochemistry is commonly deranged in patients with COVID-19. Baseline hypoalbuminaemia and rising ALP over time could be prognostic markers for death but investigation of larger cohorts is required to develop a better understanding of the relationship between liver biochemistry and disease outcome.

34284567	Pulmonary function, computerized tomography features and six-minute walk test at three months in severe COVID-19 patients treated with intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone: a preliminary report. COVID-19 ARDS has a high mortality and few therapeutic options. We present a preliminary report on our experience using high-dose pulsed methylprednisolone in COVID-19 ARDS and three-month outcomes. We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients treated with high-dose methylprednisolone for COVID-19 ARDS and three-month lung function, 6MWT, and CT findings. 15 patients were treated of which 10 survived to discharge. Reduced DLCO was the commonest abnormality in lung function tests and had the lowest mean value. Parenchymal bands were the commonest CT finding and 50% of patients had fibrosis at three-months. Mean 6MWD was 65.4% predicted and was abnormal in 62.5% of patients. In this cohort of patients with COVID-19 ARDS treated with high-dose methylprednisolone pulses, CT, lung function, and 6MWT abnormalities were unsurprisingly common at three months, although all 10 patients treated early in their disease course survived, a possible therapeutic effect. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the benefits of this treatment.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34214521	Eclampsia and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a parturient complicated by SARS COVID-19 pneumonia. A primigravida at 32 weeks of gestation presented to us with eclampsia and Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) along with SARS COVID-19 pneumonia. Immediate termination of pregnancy was done under general anesthesia and patient was electively ventilated in view of increased oxygen requirements. Further therapy using magnesium sulphate, antihypertensives, steroids, and convalescent plasma was carried out. The condition of the patient steadily improved leading to her extubation on the 4th postoperative day and subsequent discharge on the 8th day of admission.	Case Report
34226718	Pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury. Although respiratory failure and hypoxaemia are the main manifestations of COVID-19, kidney involvement is also common. Available evidence supports a number of potential pathophysiological pathways through which acute kidney injury (AKI) can develop in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Histopathological findings have highlighted both similarities and differences between AKI in patients with COVID-19 and in those with AKI in non-COVID-related sepsis. Acute tubular injury is common, although it is often mild, despite markedly reduced kidney function. Systemic haemodynamic instability very likely contributes to tubular injury. Despite descriptions of COVID-19 as a cytokine storm syndrome, levels of circulating cytokines are often lower in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome with causes other than COVID-19. Tissue inflammation and local immune cell infiltration have been repeatedly observed and might have a critical role in kidney injury, as might endothelial injury and microvascular thrombi. Findings of high viral load in patients who have died with AKI suggest a contribution of viral invasion in the kidneys, although the issue of renal tropism remains controversial. An impaired type I interferon response has also been reported in patients with severe COVID-19. In light of these observations, the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19-associated AKI may provide insights into therapeutic strategies.	Mechanism;Treatment
34226258	Acute longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis secondary to asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. A 35-year-old woman, 6 months post partum, presented with acute onset back pain at the T8 level progressing to bilateral lower limb weakness and sensory loss with urinary retention and constipation. This patient had a pre-existing inflammatory disease, having recently developed ulcerative colitis antenatally. Five days prior to admission, she had tested positive asymptomatically on a SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase PCR nasopharyngeal swab. The positive swab result was confirmed on admission. Clinical examination revealed bilaterally exaggerated knee reflexes, lower limb weakness and positive Babinski's sign. Sensation was impaired at L4 and L5 dermatomes and absent at S1 and S2. MRI findings suggested longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis, with multiple regions of patchy hyperintensity seen in the thoracic region of the spinal cord both centrally and peripherally. She was started on a course of intravenous corticosteroids and improvement was seen both clinically and on repeat imaging. This case demonstrates a rare complication to an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection and explores the potential neurotropic properties of COVID-19.	Case Report
34207689	Elevated Procalcitonin Is Positively Associated with the Severity of COVID-19: A Meta-Analysis Based on 10 Cohort Studies. Background and Objectives: Procalcitonin (PCT) is positively associated with the severity of COVID-19 (including severe, critical, or fatal outcomes), but some of the confounding factors are not considered. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the adjusted relationship between elevated procalcitonin on admission and the severity of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: We searched 1805 articles from PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases up to 2 April 2021. The articles were selected which reported the adjusted relationship applying multivariate analysis between PCT and the severity of COVID-19. The pooled effect estimate was calculated by the random-effects model. Results: The meta-analysis included 10 cohort studies with a total of 7716 patients. Patients with elevated procalcitonin on admission were at a higher risk of severe and critical COVID-19 (pooled effect estimate: 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.38-2.29; I(2) = 85.6%, p < 0.001). Similar results were also observed in dead patients (pooled effect estimate: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.36-2.30). After adjusting for diabetes, the positive association between PCT and the severity of COVID-19 decreased. Subgroup analysis revealed heterogeneity between studies and sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust. There was no evidence of publication bias by Egger's test (p = 0.106). Conclusions: Higher procalcitonin is positively associated with the severity of COVID-19, which is a potential biomarker to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 and predict the prognosis.

34221443	Assessing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in international professional golf. Objectives: There is no published data on the incidence or risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission when playing golf, a sport played outdoors where social distancing is possible. The purpose of this prospective study was to report incidence and transmission regarding SARS-CoV-2, of professional golfers competing on the PGA European Tour across 23 events in 11 countries. Methods: Daily symptom and temperature checks and weekly reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) screening were performed to determine potential carriage of SARS-CoV-2. Onset and type of symptomology were analysed. Gene expression and cycle thresholds (Cts) were reviewed for all positive cases. Repeat PCR testing was performed on all positive players. RT-PCR analysis included human housekeeping genes and various RNA genes specific for SARS-CoV-2. Results: During the study period, there were 2900 RT-PCR tests performed on 195 professional golfers competing on the European Tour. Four players tested positive on-site during the study period (0.14% of tests; positive results were declared with Ct <40). Two positive tests were returned as part of routine protocols, while two reported a history of close contact with an individual who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were isolated and target tested. All were asymptomatic at time of testing, with three developing symptoms subsequently. None required hospital admission. There was no transmission from player to player. Conclusion: Golf is an outdoor sport where social distancing is possible, meaning risks can be low if guidance is followed by participants. Risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can be mitigated by highly accurate RT-PCR testing of participants and by setting up a safe bubble that includes testing players and support staff, as well as all persons coming into contact with them during the course of the tournament, for example, drivers and hotel staff. This report can also provide reassurance for participants and policy makers regarding community golf, which can be encouraged for the health benefits it provides, in a relatively low-risk environment, with minimal risk of transmission by observing sensible viral hygiene protocols.

34222734	The Unfurl of Corona Virus and its Thwack on Human and Environment: A Review. The new Covid SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), was first recognized in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, addresses a similar family as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1). On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization pronounced the flare-up as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Diagnosis of this disease is carried out by using special molecular tests. It is mandatory to associate the individual with COVID 19 symptom and isolation is necessary to prevent further transmission of this virus. This review highlights the formation, prodrome, transmission, survival mechanism of COVID 19 and shows that, the pandemic circumstance fundamentally improves air quality in various urban areas across the globe, decreases water contamination and commotion, and diminishes the tension on the traveller objections, which may help with the reclamation of the natural framework. The worldwide effect of this new outbreak is yet dubious.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Prevention;Transmission
34222847	Nitazoxanide superiority to placebo to treat moderate COVID-19 - A Pilot prove of concept randomized double-blind clinical trial. Background: The absence of specific antivirals to treat COVID-19 leads to the repositioning of candidates' drugs. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) has a broad antiviral effect. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind pilot clinical trial comparing NTZ 600 mg BID versus Placebo for seven days among 50 individuals (25 each arm) with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR+ (PCR) that were hospitalized with mild respiratory insufficiency from May 20(th), 2020, to September 21(st), 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04348409). Clinical and virologic endpoints and inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated. A five-point scale for disease severity (SSD) was used. Findings: Two patients died in the NTZ arm compared to 6 in the placebo arm (p = 0.564). NTZ was superior to placebo when considering SSD (p < 0001), the mean time for hospital discharge (6.6 vs. 14 days, p = 0.021), and negative PCR at day 21 (p = 0.035), whereas the placebo group presented more adverse events (p = 0.04). Among adverse events likely related to the study drug, 14 were detected in the NTZ group and 22 in placebo (p = 0.24). Among the 30 adverse events unlikely related, 21 occurred in the placebo group (p = 0.04). A decrease from baseline was higher in the NTZ group for d-Dimer (p = 0.001), US-RCP (p < 0.002), TNF (p < 0.038), IL-6 (p < 0.001), IL-8 (p = 0.014), HLA DR. on CD4(+) T lymphocytes (p < 0.05), CD38 in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T (both p < 0.05), and CD38 and HLA-DR. on CD4+ (p < 0.01). Interpretation: Compared to placebo in clinical and virologic outcomes and improvement of inflammatory outcomes, the superiority of NTZ warrants further investigation of this drug for moderate COVID-19 in larger clinical trials. A higher incidence of adverse events in the placebo arm might be attributed to COVID-19 related symptoms.	Treatment
34223443	Factors associated with clinical severity in emergency department patients presenting with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Objective: To measure the association of race, ethnicity, comorbidities, and insurance status with need for hospitalization of symptomatic emergency department patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods: This study is a cohort study of symptomatic patients presenting to a single emergency department (ED) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 7-August 9, 2020. We collected patient-level information regarding demographics, insurance status, comorbidities, level of care, and mortality using a structured chart review. We compared characteristics of patients categorized by (1) home discharge, (2) general hospital ward admission, and (3) intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death within 30 days of the index visit. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to report odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) between hospital admission versus ED discharge home and between ICU care versus general hospital ward admission. Results: In total, 994 patients who presented to the ED with symptoms were included in the analysis with 551 (55.4%) patients discharged home, 314 (31.6%) patients admitted to the general hospital ward, and 129 (13.0%) admitted to the ICU or dying. Patients requiring admission were more likely to be Black or to have public insurance (Medicaid and/or Medicare). Patients who were admitted to the ICU or dying were more likely aged >/= 65 years or male. In multivariable logistic regression, old age, public insurance, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart failure, and hyperlipidemia were independent predictors of hospital admission. When comparing those who needed ICU care versus general hospital ward admission in univariate logistic regression, patients with Medicaid (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.6), Medicare (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.1-8.4), Medicaid and Medicare (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.4-7.7), history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.2), hypertension (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.7), and heart failure (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.7) were more likely to be admitted into the ICU or die; Black (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.4-2.9) and Hispanic/Latino (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.6-1.8) patients were less likely to be admitted into the ICU; however, the associations were not statistically significant. In multivariable logistic regression, old age, male sex, public insurance, and heart failure were independent predictors of ICU care/death. Conclusion: Comorbidities and public insurance are predictors of more severe illness for patients with SARS-CoV-2. This study suggests that the disparities in severity seen in COVID-19 among Black patients may be attributable, in part, to low socioeconomic status and chronic health conditions.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34288346	COVID-19 had no impact on emergency urological admissions at an Australian tertiary hospital. BACKGROUNDS: The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented threat to health and healthcare systems. There is no published data on the impact on urological presentations in Australia. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all admissions under the urology service at Liverpool Hospital, Australia from February 1st to April 30th for 2020 and the previous 5 years. RESULTS: There was a total of 397 admissions in 2020 and 438 in 2019. The mean age, proportion of male, and mean length of stay were similar. In 2020, there were 229 emergency admissions. Over the same period during the previous 5 years, there were between 195 and 218 emergency admissions. In 2019, there were 220 planned admissions and 168 in 2020. Between 2019 and 2020, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with admission longer than 10 days (P = 0.602), requiring intensive care unit admission (P = 0.708) or inpatient operative management (P = 0.171). Among the emergency admissions, the mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was significantly lower in 2020 compared to 2019 (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the pervasive fear of the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple, substantial alterations to hospital systems, structures and elective operating restrictions, no significant difference in numbers or acuity of emergency admissions were observed. Due to limitations in elective operating, there was an expected reduction in planned admissions. Our findings are in contrast to multiple recent studies and may be the result of our patient demographic where health-seeking behaviours appear to have not been significantly influenced by the pandemic.

34282852	Diagnostic test accuracy of telehealth assessment for dementia and mild cognitive impairment. BACKGROUND: Many millions of people living with dementia around the world are not diagnosed, which has a negative impact both on their access to care and treatment and on rational service planning. Telehealth - the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to provide health services at a distance - may be a way to increase access to specialist assessment for people with suspected dementia, especially those living in remote or rural areas. It has also been much used during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to know whether diagnoses made using telehealth assessment are as accurate as those made in conventional, face-to-face clinical settings. OBJECTIVES: Primary objective: to assess the diagnostic accuracy of telehealth assessment for dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Secondary objectives: to identify the quality and quantity of the relevant research evidence; to identify sources of heterogeneity in the test accuracy data; to identify and synthesise any data on patient or clinician satisfaction, resource use, costs or feasibility of the telehealth assessment models in the included studies. SEARCH METHODS: We searched multiple databases and clinical trial registers on 4 November 2020 for published and 'grey' literature and registered trials. We applied no search filters and no language restrictions. We screened the retrieved citations in duplicate and assessed in duplicate the full texts of papers considered potentially relevant. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included in the review cross-sectional studies with 10 or more participants who had been referred to a specialist service for assessment of a suspected cognitive disorder. Within a period of one month or less, each participant had to undergo two clinical assessments designed to diagnose dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI): a telehealth assessment (the index test) and a conventional face-to-face assessment (the reference standard). The telehealth assessment could be informed by some data collected face-to-face, e.g. by nurses working in primary care, but all contact between the patient and the specialist clinician responsible for synthesising the information and making the diagnosis had to take place remotely using ICT. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies. Data extracted covered study design, setting, participants, details of index test and reference standard, and results in the form of numbers of participants given diagnoses of dementia or MCI. Data were also sought on dementia subtype diagnoses and on quantitative measures of patient or clinician satisfaction, resource use, costs and feasibility. We assessed risk of bias and applicability of each included study using QUADAS-2. We entered the results into 2x2 tables in order to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of telehealth assessment for the diagnosis of all-cause dementia, MCI, and any cognitive syndrome (combining dementia and MCI). We presented the results of included studies narratively because there were too few studies to derive summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity. MAIN RESULTS: Three studies with 136 participants were eligible for inclusion. Two studies (20 and 100 participants) took place in community settings in Australia and one study (16 participants) was conducted in veterans' homes in the USA. Participants were referred from primary care with undiagnosed cognitive symptoms or were identified as being at high risk of having dementia on a screening test in the care homes. Dementia and MCI were target conditions in the larger study; the other studies targeted dementia diagnosis only. Only one small study used a 'pure' telehealth model, i.e. not involving any elements of face-to-face assessment. The studies were generally well-conducted. We considered two studies to be at high risk of incorporation bias because a substantial amount of information collected face-to-face by nurses was used to inform both index test and reference standard assessments. One study was at unclear risk of selection bias. For the diagnosis of all-cause dementia, sensitivity of telehealth assessment ranged from 0.80 to 1.00 and specificity from 0.80 to 1.00. We considered this to be very low-certainty evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency between studies and risk of bias. For the diagnosis of MCI, data were available from only one study (100 participants) giving a sensitivity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.84) and a specificity of 0.73 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.84). We considered this to be low-certainty evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias. For diagnosis of any cognitive syndrome (dementia or MCI), data from the same study gave a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.99) and a specificity of 0.22 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.60). The majority of diagnostic disagreements concerned the distinction between MCI and dementia, occurring approximately equally in either direction. There was also a tendency for patients identified as cognitively healthy at face-to-face assessment to be diagnosed with MCI at telehealth assessment (but numbers were small). There were insufficient data to make any assessment of the accuracy of dementia subtype diagnosis. One study provided a small amount of data indicating a good level of clinician and especially patient satisfaction with the telehealth model. There were no data on resource use, costs or feasibility. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found only very few eligible studies with a small number of participants. An important difference between the studies providing data for the analyses was whether the target condition was dementia only (two studies) or dementia and MCI (one study). The data suggest that telehealth assessment may be highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of all-cause dementia when assessed against a reference standard of conventional face-to-face assessment, but the estimates are imprecise due to small sample sizes and between-study heterogeneity, and may apply mainly to telehealth models which incorporate a considerable amount of face-to-face contact with healthcare professionals other than the doctor responsible for making the diagnosis. For the diagnosis of MCI by telehealth assessment, best estimates of both sensitivity and specificity were somewhat lower, but were based on a single study. Errors occurred at the cognitively healthy/MCI and the MCI/dementia boundaries. However, there is no evidence that diagnostic disagreements were more frequent than would be expected due to the known variation between clinicians' opinions when assigning a dementia diagnosis.

34211469	Cross-Reactive SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies From Deep Mining of Early Patient Responses. Passive immunization using monoclonal antibodies will play a vital role in the fight against COVID-19. The recent emergence of viral variants with reduced sensitivity to some current antibodies and vaccines highlights the importance of broad cross-reactivity. This study describes deep-mining of the antibody repertoires of hospitalized COVID-19 patients using phage display technology and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequencing to isolate neutralizing antibodies and gain insights into the early antibody response. This comprehensive discovery approach has yielded a panel of potent neutralizing antibodies which bind distinct viral epitopes including epitopes conserved in SARS-CoV-1. Structural determination of a non-ACE2 receptor blocking antibody reveals a previously undescribed binding epitope, which is unlikely to be affected by the mutations in any of the recently reported major viral variants including B.1.1.7 (from the UK), B.1.351 (from South Africa) and B.1.1.28 (from Brazil). Finally, by combining sequences of the RBD binding and neutralizing antibodies with the B cell receptor repertoire sequencing, we also describe a highly convergent early antibody response. Similar IgM-derived sequences occur within this study group and also within patient responses described by multiple independent studies published previously.	Mechanism;Treatment
34292931	Optimizing testing for COVID-19 in India. COVID-19 testing across India uses a mix of two types of tests. Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) are relatively inexpensive point-of-care lateral-flow-assay tests, but they are also less sensitive. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test has close to 100% sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting, but delays in returning results, as well as increased costs relative to RATs, may vitiate this advantage. India-wide, about 49% of COVID-19 tests are RATs, but some Indian states, including the large states of Uttar Pradesh (pop. 227.9 million) and Bihar (pop. 121.3 million) use a much higher proportion of such tests. Here we show, using simulations based on epidemiological network models, that the judicious use of RATs can yield epidemiological outcomes comparable to those obtained through RT-PCR-based testing and isolation of positives, provided a few conditions are met. These are (a) that RAT test sensitivity is not too low, (b) that a reasonably large fraction of the population, of order 0.5% per day, can be tested, (c) that those testing positive are isolated for a sufficient duration, and that (d) testing is accompanied by other non-pharmaceutical interventions for increased effectiveness. We assess optimal testing regimes, taking into account test sensitivity and specificity, background seroprevalence and current test pricing. We find, surprisingly, that even 100% RAT test regimes should be acceptable, from both an epidemiological as well as a economic standpoint, provided the conditions outlined above are met.	Diagnosis
34340267	Can commercial automated immunoassays be utilized to predict neutralizing antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection? A comparative study between three different assays. Background: High-throughput assays that can infer neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 are of great importance for assessing the immunity induced by natural infection and COVID-19 vaccines. We aimed to evaluate the performance and degree of correlation of three fully automated anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays with neutralization activity using a surrogate virus-neutralizing test (sVNT) from GenScript, targeting the receptor-binding domain. Methods: 110 sera collected from PCR-confirmed asymptomatic COVID-19 individuals were tested for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) using the sVNT. Positive samples were tested on three automated immunoassays targeting different viral antigens: Mindray CL-900i(R), Abbott Architect, and Ortho VITROS(R). The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, agreement, and correlation with the sVNT were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine optimal thresholds for predicting the presence of neutralizing activity by each assay. Results: All three assays showed 100% specificities. The highest sensitivity was 99.0%, demonstrated by VITROS(R), followed by 94.3%, for CL-900i(R), and 81.0%, for Architect. Both VITROS(R) and CL-900i(R) had the strongest correlation with the sVNT (rho = 0.718 and rho = 0.712, respectively), while Architect showed a moderate correlation (rho = 0.618). ROC curve analysis indicated that the manufacturer's recommended cutoff values are adequate for predicting the presence of nAbs and providing a strong correlation with the sVNT. Conclusion: VITROS(R) and CL-900i(R) serological assays, which detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, could serve as reliable assays to predict neutralization activity after infection or vaccination.

34199908	Precautionary Behavior Practices and Psychological Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients and Quarantined Persons. BACKGROUND: since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in 2019, South Korea has enforced isolation of patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19, as well as quarantine for close contacts of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and persons traveling from abroad, in order to contain its spread. Precautionary behavior practices and psychological characteristics of confirmed and quarantined persons were investigated for planning pandemic recovery and preparedness. METHODS: this study was conducted with 1716 confirmed patients and quarantined persons in Daegu and Busan, regions where a high number of cases were confirmed during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. We collected online survey data from 23 April to 20 May 2020, in Daegu, and 28 April to 27 May 2020, in Busan, in cooperation with Daegu and Busan Infectious Disease Control Centers and public health centers in the regions. COVID-19 symptoms, pre-cautionary behavior practices, psychological states, and the need for improvement in isolation/quarantine environments were examined using an online survey. RESULTS: compared to patients infected with coronavirus, quarantined persons engaged in more hygiene-related behaviors (e.g., hand washing, cough etiquette, and proper mask-wearing) and social distancing. COVID-19 patients had a strong fear of stigma, while quarantined persons had a strong fear of contracting COVID-19. Study participants responded that it was necessary to provide financial support and adequate information during isolation/quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: the study highlights the importance of precautionary behavior to prevent COVID-19 infection and the need to provide support (both psychological and financial) to patients and quarantined persons, to reinforce effective communication, social solidarity, and public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) in a pandemic situation.

34282508	Ultrasensitive, high-throughput, and rapid simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and IgG/IgM antibodies within 10 min through an immunoassay biochip. COVID-19 is now a severe threat to global health. Facing this pandemic, we developed a space-encoding microfluidic biochip for high-throughput, rapid, sensitive, simultaneous quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen proteins and IgG/IgM antibodies in serum. The proposed immunoassay biochip integrates the advantages of graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) and microfluidic chip and is capable of conducting multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens or IgG/IgM antibodies of 60 serum samples simultaneously with only 2 muL sample volume of each patient. Fluorescence intensity of antigens and IgG antibody detection at emission wavelength of ~680 nm was used to quantify the target concentration at excitation wavelength of 632 nm, and emission wavelength of ~519 nm was used during the detection of IgM antibodies at excitation wavelength of 488 nm. The method developed has a large linear quantification detection regime of 5 orders of magnitude, an ultralow detection limit of ~0.3 pg/mL under optimized conditions, and less than 10-min qualitative detection time. The proposed biosensing platform will not only greatly facilitate the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, but also provide a valuable screening approach for infected patients, medical therapy, and vaccine recipients.

34225157	Close proximity risk assessment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the interpersonal distance represents an important parameter affecting the risk of infection due to respiratory viruses, the mechanism of exposure to exhaled droplets remains insufficiently characterized. In this study, an integrated risk assessment is presented for SARS-CoV-2 close proximity exposure between a speaking infectious subject and a susceptible subject. It is based on a three-dimensional transient numerical model for the description of exhaled droplet spread once emitted by a speaking person, coupled with a recently proposed SARS-CoV-2 emission approach. Particle image velocimetry measurements were conducted to validate the numerical model. The contribution of the large droplets to the risk is barely noticeable only for distances well below 0.6 m, whereas it drops to zero for greater distances where it depends only on airborne droplets. In particular, for short exposures (10 s) a minimum safety distance of 0.75 m should be maintained to lower the risk below 0.1%; for exposures of 1 and 15 min this distance increases to about 1.1 and 1.5 m, respectively. Based on the interpersonal distances across countries reported as a function of interacting individuals, cultural differences, and environmental and sociopsychological factors, the approach presented here revealed that, in addition to intimate and personal distances, particular attention must be paid to exposures longer than 1 min within social distances (of about 1 m).

34221172	Covid-19: Face Mask Protection in the Pediatric Setting. We report our experience regarding a pediatric patient-case who had a covid-19 infection, which was initially considered a common viral infection and was managed accordingly for the first 36 hours while being hospitalized. Wearing a simple surgical face mask was the only protective measure which our personnel has adopted. All staff members were tested for covid-19 infection with swab specimens from the nasopharynx and pharynx and were found to be negative in 7-10 days after coming into contact with the patient. Thirty-one days after contact with the covid-19 patient, no one of the staff members had respiratory symptoms, and therefore, they all returned to work. This case shows the importance of face-mask wearing to prevent the transmission various of respiratory infections, including that caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 microorganism.	Prevention
34222646	"Priorities, actions and risks in the COVID-19 pandemic: a flash SoMe survey among surgical oncologists. Objectives: Corona virus-induced disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has globally affected the surgical treatment of cancer patients and has challenged the ethical principles of surgical oncologists around the world. Not only treatment but also diagnosis and follow-up have been disrupted. Methods: An online survey was sent through Twitter and by the surgical societies worldwide. The survey consisted of 29 closed-ended questions and was conducted over a period of 24 days beginning in March 26, 2020. Results: Overall, 394 surgical oncologists from 41 different countries answered the questionnaire. The predominant guiding principle was ""saving lives"" 240 (62%), and the different aspects of lock-down found hence large support (mean 7.1-9.3 out of 10). Shut-down of elective surgery and modification of cancer care found a mean support of 7.0 +/- 3.0 and 5.8 +/- 3.1, respectively. Modification of cancer care longer than two weeks was considered unacceptable to 114 (29%) responders. Hundred and fifty six (40%) and 138 (36%) expect ""return to normal"" beyond six months for surgical practice and cancer care, respectively. Conclusions: Surgical oncologists show strong and long-lasting support for lock-down measures aiming to save lives. The impact of the pandemic on surgical oncology is perceived controversially, but the majority was forced already now to accept what is inacceptable for many of their colleagues."	Prevention
34132990	Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody is higher in younger Austrian blood donors. PURPOSE: Frequently the infection with coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be asymptomatic or provoke only mild symptoms. These cases often remain unnoticed, so it is difficult to estimate the actual numbers of infections. Aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody in Austrian blood donors. METHODS: 20,228 blood donors aged between 18 and 72 years resident in four Austrian federal states were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody between 5th of June and 4th of December 2020. To evaluate the impact of sex, age, AB0-blood group and donation period on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, multiple logistic regression was done. RESULTS: Our data reveal an anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 2.5% overall, significantly depending on the time point of blood donation: after the first Austrian lockdown the seroprevalence was lower compared to the following months, when the rate was constantly rising. While younger blood donors showed significantly higher seroprevalence, no differences were found concerning sex or AB0 blood group. CONCLUSION: Broad testing strategies are required to better determine the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Screening blood donors as a representative group for the adult population could be a valid tool to determine the number of recorded and unrecorded cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Diagnosis
34217235	Potentials of community-based early detection of cardiovascular disease risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a significant decline in Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) screening and early detection activities, especially Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). This study aims to assess the potential of community-based self-screening of CVD risk through the mhealth application. METHODS: This is operational research by actively involving the community to carry out self-screening through the mHealth application. Community health workers were recruited as facilitators who encourage the community to carry out self-screening. To evaluate the potential of community-based self-screening of CVD risk, we use several indicators: responses rate, level of CVD risk, and community acceptance. RESULTS: Of the 846 individuals reached by the cadres, 53% or 442 individuals carried out self-screening. Based on the results of self-screening of CVD risk, it is known that around 21.3% are at high risk of developing CVD in the next 10 years. The results of the evaluation of semi-structured questions showed that about 48% of the people had positive impressions, 22% assessed that this self-screening could increase awareness and was informative, 3% suggested improvements to self-screening tools. CONCLUSION: Cadres play an important role in reaching and facilitating the community in their environment to remain aware of their health conditions by conducting self-screening of CVD risk. The availability of the mHealth application that the public can easily access can simplify CVD risk prediction and expand screening coverage, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, where there are social restrictions policies and community activities.

34223525	Traumatic Brain Injury during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic. Emergency departments (EDs) are eerily quiet for illnesses apart from COVID-19. In this short communication, we assessed the effect of COVID-19 on ED attendance rates for traumatic brain injury (TBI). Data were collected from all consecutive patients with TBI attending our hospital (Haaglanden Medical Center, The Hague, The Netherlands) during the first 3 weeks of the Dutch lockdown (from March 18 to April 6) and for the same period last year. We observed a 36% decrease in ED attendance for TBI since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (91 vs. 143). Patients who presented during the lockdown were significantly older compared with the patients who visited the ED in the previous year (72 vs. 57, p = 0.01). No other significant differences were found.	Prevention
34356762	Surveillance of Antibacterial Usage during the COVID-19 Pandemic in England, 2020. Changes in antibacterial prescribing during the COVID-19 pandemic were anticipated given that the clinical features of severe respiratory infection syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 mirror bacterial respiratory tract infections. Antibacterial consumption was measured in items/1000 population for primary care and in Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)/1000 admissions for secondary care in England from 2015 to October 2020. Interrupted time-series analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on antibacterial consumption. In the community, the rate of antibacterial items prescribed decreased further in 2020 (by an extra 1.4% per month, 95% CI: -2.3 to -0.5) compared to before COVID-19. In hospitals, the volume of antibacterial use decreased during COVID-19 overall (-12.1% compared to pre-COVID, 95% CI: -19.1 to -4.4), although the rate of usage in hospitals increased steeply in April 2020. Use of antibacterials prescribed for respiratory infections and broad-spectrum antibacterials (predominately 'Watch' antibacterials in hospitals) increased in both settings. Overall volumes of antibacterial use at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic decreased in both primary and secondary settings, although there were increases in the rate of usage in hospitals in April 2020 and in specific antibacterials. This highlights the importance of antimicrobial stewardship during pandemics to ensure appropriate prescribing and avoid negative consequences on patient outcomes and antimicrobial resistance.

34285642	Analysis of Available Nutrition Recommendations to Combat COVID-19: A Scoping Review. The current COVID-19 pandemic remains severe. There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting every aspect of our lives. Currently, the spread of inaccurate information or fake news on the internet to the public is causing the community to panic. Thus, this study aims to obtain available information on food and nutrition related to the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 from various sources. A scoping review framework was used to chart the evidence on nutritional recommendations to prevent COVID-19 based on the preferred method in reporting systematic review and meta-analysis extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The articles were categorised into three main groups: i) general dietary recommendations; ii) supplementation with specific micronutrients and iii) their mixtures and supplementation with traditional herbs and miscellaneous foods. A total of 60 articles met the inclusion criteria and were used in the review. This scoping review demonstrates that there is no miracle cure, food or supplement that can cure or prevent COVID-19. Currently, there is no confirmed treatment or vaccine for the disease. Practicing healthy eating habits is the best nutritional recommendation during the pandemic. Hence, this review hopefully will provide evidence-based nutrition recommendations that are available for current COVID-19 treatment. We hope that the authorities can inform the public and media to stop the spread of nutrition pseudoscience in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.	Prevention;Treatment
34204209	Mortality Predictors in Patients Diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Emergency Department: ECG, Laboratory and CT. Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate parameters that can be used to predict mortality in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the emergency department (ED). Materials and Methods: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ED were included in this prospective study. The patients were divided into two groups. The surviving patients were included in Group 1 (survivors), and the patients who died were included in Group 2 (non-survivors). The electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory results and chest computerized tomography (CCT) findings of the two groups were compared. The CCT images were classified according to the findings as normal, mild, moderate and severe. Results: Of the 419 patients included in the study, 347 (83%) survived (survivor) and 72 (17%) died (non-survivor). The heart rate and respiratory rate were found to be higher, and the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were found to be lower in the non-survivor patients. QRS and corrected QT interval (QTc) were measured as longer in the non-survivor patients. In the CCT images, 79.2% of the non-survivor patients had severe findings, while 11.5% of the survivor patients had severe findings. WBC, neutrophil, NLR, lactate, D-dimer, fibrinogen, C- Reactive Protein (CRP), urea, creatinine, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and hs-Troponin I levels were found to be higher and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), base excess (BE), bicarbonate (HCO3), lymphocyte eosinophil levels were found to be lower in non-survivor patients. The highest AUC was calculated at the SpO2 level and the eosinophil level. Conclusions: COVID-19 is a fatal disease whose mortality risk can be estimated when the clinical, laboratory and imaging studies of the patients are evaluated together in the ED. SpO2 that is measured before starting oxygen therapy, the eosinophil levels and the CT findings are all important predictors of mortality risk.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34130814	Influence of the lockdown due to COVID-19 on weight-loss results during the first year after sleeve gastrectomy. INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic has lead to lockdown of population in many countries. In Spain, the state of alarm was established from March 15 to June 20, 2020. Usually this fact decreased people's mobility and physical activity, in addition to producing or exacerbating psychological disorders. Our aim was to determine the influence that this condition had over the short-term ponderal results of patients undergoing laparoscopic vertical gastrectomy from May 2019 to May 2020. METHODS: Case-control study for comparing the percentage of excess weight lost (%EWL) and the percentage of total weight lost (%TWL) of patients that underwent a VG during the last year, so they were affected by lockdown in April and part of March 2020 (group 1), to the %EWL and %TWL of a control group (group 2), obtained from our previous series. RESULTS: The mean %EWL in group 1 is 47.37+/-18.59 and in group 2 is 51.13+/-17.59, being P=.438. Meanwhile, the mean %TWL in group 1 is 21.14+/-8.17 and in group 2 is 24.67+/-8.01, with P=.115. CONCLUSIONS: Population lockdown by COVID-19 did not get worse short-term results of vertical gastrectomy. More studies with a larger number of patients are necessary to draw firm conclusions.

34222571	Identification of Cross-Reactive CD8(+) T Cell Receptors with High Functional Avidity to a SARS-CoV-2 Immunodominant Epitope and Its Natural Mutant Variants. Despite the growing knowledge of T cell responses in COVID-19 patients, there is a lack of detailed characterizations for T cell-antigen interactions and T cell functions. Here, with a predicted peptide library from SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins, restricted to three of the most prominent HLA-A alleles in the Asian population, we found that specific CD8(+) T cell responses were identified in over 75% of COVID-19 convalescent patients (15/20). A total of 15 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes from the S and N proteins were identified, and among them, 3 dominant epitopes were further characterized. We found that an epitope from the N protein, N(361-369) (KTFPPTEPK), was the most dominant epitope from our selected peptide library. Importantly, we discovered 2 N(361-369)-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) with high functional avidity that were independent of the CD8 co-receptor. These TCRs exhibited complementary cross-reactivity to several presently reported N(361-369) mutant variants, as to the wild-type epitope. Further, the natural functions of these TCRs in the cytotoxic immunity against SARS-CoV-2 were determined with dendritic cells (DCs) and the lung organoid model. We found that the N(361-369) epitope could be normally processed and endogenously presented by these different types of antigen presenting cells, to elicit successful activation and effective cytotoxicity of CD8(+) T cells ex vivo. Our study evidenced potential mechanisms of cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and illuminated potential ways of viral clearance in COVID-19 patients. These results indicate that utilizing CD8-independent TCRs against SARS-CoV-2-associated antigens may provide functional superiority that is beneficial for the adoptive cell immunotherapies based on natural or genetically engineered T cells. Additionally, this information is highly relevant for the development of the next-generation vaccines with protections against continuously emerged SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains.	Mechanism;Treatment
34198390	Modeling the cardiac response to hemodynamic changes associated with COVID-19: a computational study. Emerging studies address how COVID-19 infection can impact the human cardiovascular system. This relates particularly to the development of myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Prospective treatment approach is advised for these patients. To study the interplay between local changes (reduced contractility), global variables (peripheral resistances, heart rate) and the cardiac function, we considered a lumped parameters computational model of the cardiovascular system and a three-dimensional multiphysics model of cardiac electromechanics. Our mathematical model allows to simulate the systemic and pulmonary circulations, the four cardiac valves and the four heart chambers, through equations describing the underlying physical processes. By the assessment of conventionally relevant parameters of cardiac function obtained through our numerical simulations, we propose a computational model to effectively reveal the interactions between the cardiac and pulmonary functions in virtual subjects with normal and impaired cardiac function at baseline affected by mild or severe COVID-19.

34337554	Performance of Crisis Standards of Care Guidelines in a Cohort of Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients in the United States. Many US states published crisis standards of care (CSC) guidelines for allocating scarce critical care resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the performance of these guidelines in maximizing population benefit has not been well tested. In 2,272 adults with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission drawn from the STOP-COVID multicenter cohort, we tested three approaches to CSC algorithms: SOFA scores grouped into ranges, SOFA score ranges plus comorbidities, and a hypothetical approach using raw SOFA scores not grouped into ranges. We found that area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves for all three algorithms demonstrate only modest discrimination for 28-day mortality. Adding comorbidity scoring modestly improves algorithm performance over SOFA scores alone. The algorithm incorporating comorbidities has modestly worse predictive performance for Black compared to White patients. CSC algorithms should be empirically examined to refine approaches to the allocation of scarce resources during pandemics and to avoid potential exacerbation of racial inequities.	Prevention
34355020	A Validated Mathematical Model of the Cytokine Release Syndrome in Severe COVID-19. By June 2021, a new contagious disease, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected more than 172 million people worldwide, causing more than 3.7 million deaths. Many aspects related to the interactions of the disease's causative agent, SAR2-CoV-2, and the immune response are not well understood: the multiscale interactions among the various components of the human immune system and the pathogen are very complex. Mathematical and computational tools can help researchers to answer these open questions about the disease. In this work, we present a system of fifteen ordinary differential equations that models the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The model is used to investigate the hypothesis that the SARS-CoV-2 infects immune cells and, for this reason, induces high-level productions of inflammatory cytokines. Simulation results support this hypothesis and further explain why survivors have lower levels of cytokines levels than non-survivors.	Mechanism;Treatment
34223524	Perfect Storm: COVID-19 Associated Cardiac Injury and Implications for Neurological Disorders. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to considerable lung damage and even death. Less is known about the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. In their recent JAMA Cardiology article, Shi and colleagues reported an association between cardiac injury and higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Approximately 20% (82 patients) of the study cohort presented with a cardiac injury. The investigators identified cardiac injury as an independent risk factor of mortality during hospitalization (52% with cardiac injury vs. 5% without cardiac injury, p < 0.001). Consequently, their findings are highly relevant for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Among those are patients with neurological disorders. There is a considerable prevalence of myocardial injury in patients with acute neurological illness, which appears to adversely affect prognosis. Individuals with an underlying neurological disorder are particularly vulnerable to increased cardio-cerebrovascular disease risk due to physical limitations and the pathophysiology of their condition. Thus, we would like to specifically highlight the attention of health care professionals treating patients with pervasive neurological disorders to their potentially elevated risk of poorer COVID-19 related outcomes.

34219400	A rapid review of medication taking ('adherence') among patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify, appraise, synthesize, and contextualize rapidly emerging reports on medication taking ('adherence') among patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL for peer-reviewed communications, letters, and manuscripts published during the COVID-19 pandemic evaluating medication taking among individuals with rheumatic diseases. We appraised assessment and reporting of medication adherence according to established definitions of three distinct problems of medication taking (i.e., non-initiation, poor implementation, and discontinuation) and pooled findings using random effects models. RESULTS: We included 31 peer-reviewed studies in our synthesis from various jurisdictions, of which 25 described medication taking among rheumatology patients and 6 described medication prescribing among rheumatology providers. The pooled prevalence of overall medication non-adherence was 14.8% (confidence interval [CI]: 12.3%, 17.2%) and that of medication discontinuation (i.e., stopping of prescriptions) and poor implementation (i.e., not taking medication at the dose/frequency prescribed) as 9.5% (CI: 5.1%, 14.0%) and 9.6% (CI: 6.2%, 13.0%), respectively. Non-initiation (i.e., not starting/not filling new prescriptions) was not addressed. CONCLUSIONS: Medication taking among individuals with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic varies globally. Unclear reporting and extensive variation in research methods between studies creates barriers to research replication, comparison, and generalization to specific patient populations. Future research in this area should use consistent and transparent approaches to defining and measuring medication taking problems in order to ensure findings appropriately describe the epidemiology of medication adherence and have the potential to identify modifiable targets for improving patient care.

34358031	The Potential Role of an Aberrant Mucosal Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2 in the Pathogenesis of IgA Nephropathy. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global concern. Immunoglobin A (IgA) contributes to virus neutralization at the early stage of infection. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess whether SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA production persists for a longer time in patients recovered from severe COVID-19 and its lasting symptoms that can have disabling consequences should also be alerted to susceptible hosts. Here, we tracked the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody levels in a cohort of 88 COVID-19 patients. We found that 52.3% of the patients produced more anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgA than IgG or IgM, and the levels of IgA remained stable during 4-41 days of infection. One of these IgA-dominant COVID-19 patients, concurrently with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), presented with elevated serum creatinine and worse proteinuria during the infection, which continued until seven months post-infection. The serum levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD and total IgA were higher in this patient than in healthy controls. Changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, increased IgA highly coated bacteria, and elevated concentration of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18 were indicative of potential involvement of intestinal dysbiosis and inflammation to the systemic IgA level and, consequently, the disease progression. Collectively, our work highlighted the potential adverse effect of the mucosal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that additional care should be taken with COVID-19 patients presenting with chronic diseases such as IgAN.

34286216	Using mixed-effects modeling to estimate decay kinetics of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The duration of natural immunity in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a matter of some debate in the literature at present. For example, in a recent publication characterizing SARS-CoV-2 immunity over time, the authors fit pooled longitudinal data, using fitted slopes to infer the duration of SARS-CoV-2 immunity. In fact, such approaches can lead to misleading conclusions as a result of statistical model-fitting artifacts. To exemplify this phenomenon, we reanalyzed one of the markers (pseudovirus neutralizing titer) in the publication, using mixed-effects modeling, a methodology better suited to longitudinal datasets like these. Our findings showed that the half-life was both longer and more variable than reported by the authors. The example selected by us here illustrates the utility of mixed-effects modeling in provide more accurate estimates of the duration and heterogeneity of half-lives of molecular and cellular biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 immunity.

34288594	Safety protocols in an exercise facility result in no detectable sars-CoV2 spread: A case study. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease has been a public health emergency of international concern with millions of confirmed cases globally. Closed environments with reduced ventilation contribute to the spread of COVID-19, including superspreading events. Exercising in closed places further increases the risk for transmission. Therefore, many fitness facilities were closed as part of mandated shutdowns early in the pandemic. Evidence-based safety protocols have now emerged and substantially reduce the risk of transmission. We report three positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 identified at a Dojo exercise facility in Manlius, NY, at three distinct time points. All cases were present in the Dojo 2 days prior to symptoms, a time period considered to be highly infectious. The safety protocols included universal mask wearing (no valves), multiple high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, and reduced capacity which resulted in no known spread of COVID-19.

34374951	A Narrative Review of the Clinical Practicalities of Bamlanivimab and Etesevimab Antibody Therapies for SARS-CoV-2. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from mild to death, with high morbidity and mortality rates reported amongst a vulnerable subset of patients termed high risk. While vaccines remain the primary option for COVID-19 prevention, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as bamlanivimab and etesevimab, have been shown to benefit certain subpopulations after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Unlike vaccine-derived immunity that develops over time, administration of neutralizing mAbs is an immediate and passive immunotherapy, with the potential to reduce disease progression, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and death. Bamlanivimab alone and together with etesevimab hold emergency use authorizations in several countries globally, with countries increasingly transitioning to the use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together and other authorized mAbs on the basis of their evolving variant landscape, regulatory authorizations, and access to drugs. The current guidelines for the administration of bamlanivimab alone or together with etesevimab are informed by an iterative process of testing and development. Herein the rationale for these guidelines is provided by sharing the learnings that have been gathered throughout the development process of these mAbs. In addition, this review addresses the most common clinical questions received from health care professionals (HCPs) and patients regarding indicated population, dose, use with other medications and vaccines, duration of protection, and variants in clinical practice. As prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants can differ by country and state, prescribing HCPs should consider the prevalence of bamlanivimab and etesevimab resistant variants in their area, where data are available, regarding potential efficacy impact when considering treatment options.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04427501; NCT04411628; NCT04497987; NCT04634409.

34220212	A single centered study reveals association between liver injury and COVID-19 infection. Despite the fact that it has been over a year with the pandemic COVID-19 infection, ongoing research and analysis reveal many complications and comorbidities associated with COVID-19. In this study, we aimed at investigating the clinical and laboratory assessments in COVID-19 patients with and without liver injury. Methods: Symptomatic 541 COVID-19 positive patients, who were admitted to Al Kuwait Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), were recruited in this study. Their data was collected retrospectively, including demographic data, blood tests, symptoms, radiographical assessments, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Results: Around 19% of the recruited COVID-19 patients displayed signs of acute liver injury. Also, there was an increase in the percentage of critical, ICU-admitted and mortality rates in COVID-19 cases with liver injury, as well as a higher percentage of septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). COVID-19 patients with liver injury had more pronounced bilateral consolidation, lymphopenia and neutrophilia. Additionally, these patients had higher levels of CRP, LDH, procalcitonin, ferritin and D dimer levels. Finally, there was a higher percentage of patients taking various COVID-19 therapies in the COVID-19 patients with liver injury group. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients with acute liver injury are at a higher risk for serious outcomes including death.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34213312	COVID-19 as a Trigger of Brain Autoimmunity. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system (CNS) activates microglia, triggering chronic neuroinflammation and possibly neurodegeneration. The complex transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 shares molecular similarities with diverse human CNS protein epitopes, leading to a cytokine storm and various autoantibodies, potentially culminating in an autoimmune state. A COVID-19 initiated CNS autoimmune cascade may occur via multiple pathways including molecular mimicry, bystander activation, epitope spreading, production of autoantibodies, and immortalization of effector B-cells.

34283162	SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain as a Stable-Potential Target for SARS-CoV-2 Detection by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy. In this work, we report a new approach for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (RBD) using the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technique. The optical enhancement was obtained thanks to the preparation of nanostructured Ag/Au substrates. Fabricated Au/Ag nanostructures were used in the SERS experiment for RBD protein detection. SERS substrates show higher capabilities and sensitivity to detect RBD protein in a short time (3 s) and with very low power. We were able to push the detection limit of proteins to a single protein detection level of 1 pM. The latter is equivalent to 1 fM as a detection limit of viruses. Additionally, we have shown that the SERS technique was useful to figure out the presence of RBD protein on antibody functionalized substrates. In this case, the SERS detection was based on protein-antibody recognition, which led to shifts in the Raman peaks and allowed signal discrimination between RBD and other targets such as Bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein. A perfect agreement between a 3D simulated model based on finite element method and experiment was reported confirming the SERS frequency shift potential for trace proteins detection. Our results could open the way to develop a new prototype based on SERS sensitivity and selectivity for rapid detection at a very low concentration of virus and even at a single protein level.

34217417	Impact of the suspension and restart of the Dutch breast cancer screening program on breast cancer incidence and stage during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the Dutch national breast screening program to a halt in week 12, 2020. In week 26, the breast program was resumed at 40% capacity, which increased to 60% in week 34. We examined the impact of the suspension and restart of the screening program on the incidence of screen-detected and non-screen-detected breast cancer. We selected women aged 50-74, diagnosed during weeks 2-35 of 2018 (n = 7250), 2019 (n = 7302), or 2020 (n = 5306), from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Weeks 2-35 were divided in seven periods, based on events occurring at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Incidence of screen-detected and non-screen-detected tumors was calculated overall and by age group, cT-stage, and cTNM-stage for each period in 2020, and compared to the incidence in the same period of 2018/2019 (averaged). The incidence of screen-detected tumors decreased during weeks 12-13, reached almost zero during weeks 14-25, and increased during weeks 26-35. Incidence of non-screen-detected tumors decreased to a lesser extent during weeks 12-16. The decrease in incidence was seen in all age groups and mainly occurred for cTis, cT1, DCIS, and stage I tumors. Due to the suspension of the breast cancer screening program, and the restart at reduced capacity, the incidence of screen-detected breast tumors decreased by 67% during weeks 9-35 2020, which equates to about 2000 potentially delayed breast cancer diagnoses. Up to August 2020 there was no indication of a shift towards higher stage breast cancers after restart of the screening.	Prevention
34369836	Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 viral load: current status and future prospects. Introduction: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a novel viral agent that quickly spread worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and had an immeasurable toll on the economy. Currently, most clinical cases are identified by qualitative molecular testing. However, the need for quantitative assessment is gaining traction.Areas covered: In this review, the current state and future perspective of SARS-CoV-2 viral load quantification is presented.Expert opinion: Viral load quantification is a critical measure that informs clinicians of treatment response, actionable viral load levels, and guidance on patient management. Additionally, for pathogens with epidemiological consequences, viral load can provide information to guide infection control measures and policies. While qualitative detection is sufficient to identify cases and initiate containment and mitigation measures in the vast majority of COVID-19 cases, in certain situations, SARS-CoV-2 quantification is needed to assess viral load trending. However, there are obstacles to quantification, including variability in respiratory specimen collection and the lack of commutable reference material. At the same time, the need for quantification for clinical and epidemiological management is growing, especially concerning individuals with prolonged RNA shedding.	Diagnosis
34202997	From RNA World to SARS-CoV-2: The Edited Story of RNA Viral Evolution. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic underscores the importance of understanding the evolution of RNA genomes. While RNA is subject to the formation of similar lesions as DNA, the evolutionary and physiological impacts RNA lesions have on viral genomes are yet to be characterized. Lesions that may drive the evolution of RNA genomes can induce breaks that are repaired by recombination or can cause base substitution mutagenesis, also known as base editing. Over the past decade or so, base editing mutagenesis of DNA genomes has been subject to many studies, revealing that exposure of ssDNA is subject to hypermutation that is involved in the etiology of cancer. However, base editing of RNA genomes has not been studied to the same extent. Recently hypermutation of single-stranded RNA viral genomes have also been documented though its role in evolution and population dynamics. Here, we will summarize the current knowledge of key mechanisms and causes of RNA genome instability covering areas from the RNA world theory to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of today. We will also highlight the key questions that remain as it pertains to RNA genome instability, mutations accumulation, and experimental strategies for addressing these questions.	Mechanism
34219492	Punctate inner choroidopathy reactivation following COVID-19: A case report. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to report our experience with a case of punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) reactivation following COVID-19. CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old caucasian woman with past ophthalmological history of bilateral PIC reported sudden visual acuity decrease in her right eye (RE) 3 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/32 in RE; fundus examination and multimodal imaging (including indocyanine-green angiography, fundus autofluorescence, and optical coherence tomography) was consistent with unilateral PIC reactivation. The active choroidal lesions responded to high-dose corticosteroids, with functional improvement. CONCLUSION: Sars-CoV-2 infection could induce autoimmune and autoinflammatory dysregulation in genetically predisposed subjects. We report a case of PIC reactivation following COVID-19.	Case Report
34210789	"Risk factors for long covid in previously hospitalised children using the ISARIC Global follow-up protocol: A prospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: The long-term sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in children remain poorly characterised. This study aimed to assess long-term outcomes in children previously hospitalised with Covid-19 and associated risk factors. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of children (</=18 years old) admitted with confirmed Covid-19. Children admitted to the hospital between April 2, 2020 and August 26, 2020, were included. Telephone interview using the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) Covid-19 Health and Wellbeing paediatric follow-up survey. Persistent symptoms (>5 months) were further categorised by system(s) involved. FINDINGS: 518 of 853 (61%) of eligible children were available for the follow-up assessment and included in the study. Median age was 10.4 years (IQR, 3-15.2) and 270 (52.1%) were girls; median follow-up since hospital discharge was 256 (223-271) days. At the time of the follow-up interview 126 (24.3%) participants reported persistent symptoms among which fatigue (53, 10.7%), sleep disturbance (36, 6.9%,) and sensory problems (29, 5.6%) were the most common. Multiple symptoms were experienced by 44 (8.4%) participants. Risk factors for persistent symptoms were: older age ""6-11 years"" (odds ratio 2.74 (95% confidence interval 1.37 to 5.75) and ""12-18 years"" (2.68, 1.41 to 5.4); and a history of allergic diseases (1.67, 1.04 to 2.67). INTERPRETATION: A quarter of children experienced persistent symptoms months after hospitalization with acute covid-19 infection, with almost one in ten experiencing multi-system involvement. Older age and allergic diseases were associated with higher risk of persistent symptoms at follow-up."	Diagnosis;Treatment
34363249	Characteristics of facial skin problems and microbiome variation during wearing masks for fighting against COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 168 million people to be infected and 3 million people to die([1]) . Although the COVID-19 vaccination work for the general population has been started, herd immunity cannot be achieved in the short term term([2]) . Wearing masks is still the most effective means for the public to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. However, the occurrence of facial skin problems caused by wearing masks may, under some conditions, influence the maintenance of mask wearing among the public.	Prevention
34206645	SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Willingness among Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women during the First Pandemic Wave: A Cross-Sectional Study in Switzerland. As pregnant women are at high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines are available in Switzerland, this study aimed to assess the willingness of Swiss pregnant and breastfeeding women to become vaccinated. Through a cross-sectional online study conducted after the first pandemic wave, vaccination practices and willingness to become vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 if a vaccine was available were evaluated through binary, multi-choice, and open-ended questions. Factors associated with vaccine willingness were evaluated through univariable and multivariable analysis. A total of 1551 women responded to questions related to the primary outcome. Only 29.7% (153/515) of pregnant and 38.6% (400/1036) of breastfeeding women were willing to get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 if a vaccine had been available during the first wave. Positive predictors associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine acceptance were an age older than 40 years, a higher educational level, history of influenza vaccination within the previous year, having an obstetrician as the primary healthcare practitioner, and being in their third trimester of pregnancy. After the first pandemic wave, Switzerland had a low SARS-CoV-2 vaccination acceptance rate, emphasizing the need to identify and reduce barriers for immunization in pregnant and breastfeeding women, particularly among the youngest and those with a lower educational level.

34368314	COVID-19 patient with an incubation period of 27 d: A case report. BACKGROUND: As a highly contagious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is wreaking havoc around the world due to continuous spread among close contacts mainly via droplets, aerosols, contaminated hands or surfaces. Therefore, centralized isolation of close contacts and suspected patients is an important measure to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. At present, the quarantine duration in most countries is 14 d due to the fact that the incubation period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is usually identified as 1-14 d with median estimate of 4-7.5 d. Since COVID-19 patients in the incubation period are also contagious, cases with an incubation period of more than 14 d need to be evaluated. CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine of The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University on April 5 due to a cough with sputum and shortness of breath. On April 10, the patient was transferred to the Fever Clinic for further treatment due to close contact to one confirmed COVID-19 patient in the same room. During the period from April 10 to May 6, nucleic acid and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were tested 7 and 4 times, respectively, all of which were negative. On May 7, the patient developed fever with a maximum temperature of 39, and his respiratory difficulties had deteriorated. The results of nucleic acid and antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 were positive. On May 8, the nucleic acid and antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Heilongjiang Provincial Center for Disease Control were also positive, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period. Further epidemiological investigations and clinical observations are urgently needed to identify the optimal incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 and formulate rational and evidence-based quarantine policies for COVID-19 accordingly.

34336879	Scoring System to Evaluate the Performance of ICU Ventilators in the Pandemic of COVID-19: A Lung Model Study. Ventilators in the intensive care units (ICU) are life-support devices that help physicians to gain additional time to cure the patients. The aim of the study was to establish a scoring system to evaluate the ventilator performance in the context of COVID-19. The scoring system was established by weighting the ventilator performance on five different aspects: the stability of pressurization, response to leaks alteration, performance of reaction, volume delivery, and accuracy in oxygen delivery. The weighting factors were determined with analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Survey was sent out to 66 clinical and mechanical experts. The scoring system was built based on 54 valid replies. A total of 12 commercially available ICU ventilators providing non-invasive ventilation were evaluated using the novel scoring system. A total of eight ICU ventilators with non-invasive ventilation mode and four dedicated non-invasive ventilators were tested according to the scoring system. Four COVID-19 phenotypes were simulated using the ASL5000 lung simulator, namely (1) increased airway resistance (IR) (10 cm H2O/L/s), (2) low compliance (LC) (compliance of 20 ml/cmH2O), (3) low compliance plus increased respiratory effort (LCIE) (respiratory rate of 40 and inspiratory effort of 10 cmH2O), (4) high compliance (HC) (compliance of 50 ml/cmH2O). All of the ventilators were set to three combinations of pressure support and positive end-expiratory pressure levels. The data were collected at baseline and at three customized leak levels. Significant inaccuracies and variations in performance between different non-invasive ventilators were observed, especially in the aspect of leaks alteration, oxygen and volume delivery. Some ventilators have stable performance in different simulated phenotypes whereas the others have over 10% scoring differences. It is feasible to use the proposed scoring system to evaluate the ventilator performance. In the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians should be aware of possible strengths and weaknesses of ventilators.

34285902	Cardiovascular adverse effects of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients: Cases from a single pharmacovigilance centre. In this article we summarize the cardiovascular adverse events that were observed in three patients during their treatment for COVID-19 and discuss their association with lopinavir/ ritonavir (LPV/r) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The cases were reported to our regional pharmacovigilance centre in April 2020. All three patients were above 75 years in age, male and multimorbid, and had been hospitalized for treatment of COVID-19. As part of their treatment, all of them received a very strictly monitored off-label therapy with LPV/r and HCQ, for which they had given their prior, written, informed consent. In one patient, erythromycin was also administered. All three patients developed a significant QTc time prolongation during or shortly after therapy with the above drugs. On account of this, the treatment had to be discontinued early in each case and QTc time recovered in all three patients.	Case Report
34365591	Human Stem Cell Models of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the Cardiovascular System. The virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected over 190 million people to date, causing a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 relies on binding of its spike glycoprotein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for infection. In addition to fever, cough, and shortness of breath, severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in the rapid overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This overactive immune response is known as a cytokine storm, which leads to several serious clinical manifestations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and myocardial injury. Cardiovascular disorders such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and heart failure not only enhance disease progression at the onset of infection, but also arise in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Tissue-specific differentiated cells and organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) serve as an excellent model to address how SARS-CoV-2 damages the lungs and the heart. In this review, we summarize the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the current clinical perspectives of the bidirectional relationship between the cardiovascular system and viral progression. Furthermore, we also address the utility of hPSCs as a dynamic model for SARS-CoV-2 research and clinical translation.	Mechanism;Treatment;Diagnosis
34364862	SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater as an early warning indicator for COVID-19 pandemic. Madrid region case study. COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing for more than a year and has changed priorities and boosted some WBE studies. The aim of this work is to contributed to our knowledge sharing the methodology developed for SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater of Madrid region of over six million and a half inhabitants, where the sewer system is a combined system. At first, a pilot test in a small metropolitan area was carried out in order to define the criteria for the selection of the sampling points to be applied to the entire region. Methodologys for laboratory analysis and statistical analysis and interpretation of data are also presented. This work relies highly on fieldwork, so sewer network safe accessibility is paramount. A total of 289 sampling points were weekly characterised. Each sampling point represents a sewershed, some of them in a cascade distribution. Samples are tested for SARS-CoV-2 concentration (gc/L, genome copies per litre) and physicochemical parameters are also analysed to validate or discard what at first could be an unusual virus presence. Field results are correlated with health indicators such as incidence rates and hospitalisation data. This information is daily shared with regional health authorities, disaggregated by municipalities, or aggregated for the entire Madrid region. Results have proved to anticipate health indicators. The tool is used as an early warning indicator for COVID-19 pandemic. Further work is planned to apply the current scheme for a permanent epidemiological surveillance system of 87 sampling points to pinpoint infection hotspots and activate the linked sewersheds in the event of an outbreak.

34292620	Clinicopathologic Findings in COVID-19-Associated Ischemic Enterocolitis. AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a predominantly respiratory tract infection, but some patients manifest severe systemic symptoms/coagulation abnormalities. We evaluated the impact of severe COVID-19 infection on the gastrointestinal tract. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined clinicopathologic findings in 28 resected ischemic bowels from 22 patients with severe COVID-19. Most patients required intubation preoperatively and presented with acute decompensation shortly before surgery. D-dimer levels were markedly elevated in all measured cases (mean: 5394 ng/mL). Histologically, 25 cases (19 patients) showed evidence of acute ischemia with necrosis. In this group, the most characteristic finding was the presence of small vessel fibrin thrombi (24/25 cases, 96%), which were numerous in 64% of cases. Compared to a control cohort of 35 non-COVID-19-related acute ischemic bowels, patients with COVID-19 were significantly more likely to show isolated small intestine involvement (32% vs. 6%, p<0.001), small vessel fibrin thrombi (100% vs. 43%, p<0.001), submucosal vessels with fibrinous degeneration and perivascular neutrophils (90% vs. 54%, p<0.001), fibrin strands within submucosal vessels (58% vs. 20%, p=0.007), and histologic evidence of pneumatosis (74% vs. 34%, p=0.010). Three cases in this cohort had histopathologic findings normally seen in the setting of chronic ischemia, notably prominent fibroblastic proliferation affecting the outer layer of the muscularis propria. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we describe the histopathologic findings in COVID-19-associated ischemic bowel and postulate a relationship to the hypercoagulable state seen in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Additional experience with these cases may further elucidate specific features or mechanisms of COVID-19-associated ischemic enterocolitis.	Diagnosis

Rapidly ramping up vaccine coverage rates while enhancing public health and social measures is now even more urgent and important.	Mechanism;Prevention;Transmission
34215897	Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19 Pneumonia Who Developed Bradycardia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes of bradycardic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. METHODS: The electronic medical records of 221 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia between June and September 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient characteristics, electrocardiographic data, and clinical and laboratory information were retrospectively collected. Patients not treated with drugs that blunt chronotropic response (nodal) were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Only patients whose heart rate was <60 beats per minute (bpm) (136/221, 61.5%) were included. Serial electrocardiography revealed that most patients (130/137, 97.7%) remained in sinus rhythm. The heart rate was between 50 and 59 bpm in 75% of the patients, while 18.4% were in the 40 to 49 bpm range, and 6.6% were <40 bpm. Medians for development of bradycardia after swab polymerase chain reaction positivity and duration of bradycardia were 41 hours and 5 days, respectively. Bradycardia resolved in 81 patients (59.6%). There were no statistically significant differences in outcomes according to degree of bradycardia (<50 vs 50-59, all P >/= 0.073). No significant differences were noted for the overall cohort when comparing COVID-19 treatments according to resolution of bradycardia; however, when considering only the patients who were not receiving a nodal agent or antiarrhythmic, treatment with lenzilumab was more common in patients with resolution of bradycardia than patients without resolution of bradycardia (12.2% vs 0.0%, P = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Sinus bradycardia occurs frequently in patients with severe COVID-19, but the degree of bradycardia does not correlate with clinical outcomes. Lenzilumab may be associated with the resolution of bradycardia.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34200926	Dog Walking before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown: Experiences of UK Dog Owners. BACKGROUND: This study investigated the impacts of the first COVID-19 UK lockdown on dog walking and ownership. METHODS: An online survey was circulated via social media (May-June 2020). Completed responses (n = 584) were analysed using within- and between-group comparisons, and multivariable linear and logistic regression models were created. Open-ended data were coded into key themes. RESULTS: During lockdown, dogs were walked less frequently, yet for a similar duration per week and closer to home. Dogs whose owners lived alone, or whose owners or household members had heightened vulnerability to COVID-19 were walked less than before, as were high-energy dogs. A minority of owners continued dog walking despite exhibiting symptoms or needing to self-isolate, justifying lack of help, dog behavioural problems, living in less populated areas, and the importance of outdoor exercise for their mental health. Dog ownership had multiple benefits (companionship, purpose and motivation; break from bad; positive to focus on) as well as challenges (changes in dog behaviour, balancing dog needs with public health guidance, accessing pet food/supplies and services, and sharing crowded outdoor spaces with others). Most did not have an emergency care plan for their pet before the pandemic and only a handful developed one. CONCLUSIONS: Findings can be used to inform public health and dog welfare strategies for future lockdown situations or other disasters and emergencies likely to impact on daily routines.	Prevention
34281931	Risk factors for mortality of adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalised in an emerging country: a cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To describe mortality of in-hospital patients with COVID-19 and compare risk factors between survivors and non-survivors. DESIGN: Prospective cohort of adult inpatients. SETTING: Tertiary healthcare teaching hospital in Guadalajara, Mexico. PARTICIPANTS: All patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalised from 25 March to 7 September 2020 were included. End of study: 7 November 2020. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient survival analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method and comparison of factors by the log-rank test. Mortality risk factors analysed by multivariate Cox's proportional-hazard model. RESULTS: One thousand ten patients included: 386 (38%) died, 618 (61%) alive at discharge and six (0.6%) remained hospitalised. There was predominance of men (63%) and high frequency of overweight-obesity (71%); hypertension (54%); diabetes (40%); and lung (9%), cardiovascular (8%) and kidney diseases (11%); all of them significantly more frequent in non-survivors. Overweight-obesity was not different between groups, but severity of disease (Manchester Triage System and quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) was significantly worse in non-survivors, who were also significantly older (65 vs 45 years, respectively) and had haematological, biochemical, coagulation and inflammatory biomarkers more altered than survivors. Mortality predictors were invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV; OR 3.31, p<0.0001), admission to intensive care unit (ICU; OR 2.18, p<0.0001), age (OR 1.02, p<0.0001), Manchester Triage System (urgent OR 1.44, p=0.02; immediate/very urgent OR 2.02, p=0.004), baseline C reactive protein (CRP; OR 1.002, p=0.009) and antecedent of kidney disease (OR 1.58, p=0.04) CONCLUSIONS: Mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in this emerging country centre seemed to be higher than in developed countries. Patients displayed a high frequency of risk factors for poor outcome, but the need for IMV, ICU admission, older age, more severe disease at admission, antecedent of kidney disease and higher CRP levels significantly predicted mortality.

34203268	Emerging Advances of Nanotechnology in Drug and Vaccine Delivery against Viral Associated Respiratory Infectious Diseases (VARID). Viral-associated respiratory infectious diseases are one of the most prominent subsets of respiratory failures, known as viral respiratory infections (VRI). VRIs are proceeded by an infection caused by viruses infecting the respiratory system. For the past 100 years, viral associated respiratory epidemics have been the most common cause of infectious disease worldwide. Due to several drawbacks of the current anti-viral treatments, such as drug resistance generation and non-targeting of viral proteins, the development of novel nanotherapeutic or nano-vaccine strategies can be considered essential. Due to their specific physical and biological properties, nanoparticles hold promising opportunities for both anti-viral treatments and vaccines against viral infections. Besides the specific physiological properties of the respiratory system, there is a significant demand for utilizing nano-designs in the production of vaccines or antiviral agents for airway-localized administration. SARS-CoV-2, as an immediate example of respiratory viruses, is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the coronaviridae family. COVID-19 can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, similarly to other members of the coronaviridae. Hence, reviewing the current and past emerging nanotechnology-based medications on similar respiratory viral diseases can identify pathways towards generating novel SARS-CoV-2 nanotherapeutics and/or nano-vaccines.

34209416	The Impact of a Telehealth Intervention on Activity Profiles in Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Study. BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity during the COVID-19 pandemic is a public health concern for older adults. Telehealth presents a safe platform for conducting health-related interventions that may have additional benefits such as widespread reach. Our pilot study sought to examine how a telehealth intervention changed activity profiles in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: There were n =13 adults aged 70.6 +/- 4.5 years that participated in a 6 week telehealth intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic. The didactic intervention contents were shared online, and participants worked with trained interviewers over the telephone to discuss physical activity. At baseline and post-intervention, the Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adults examined activity profiles, while accelerometry estimated time spent sedentary and in physical activity. RESULTS: Relative to the baseline measures, there was an 88 min/day (95% confidence interval (CI): 39, 137) increase in computer time and 36 min/day (CI: 10, 62) reduction in time spent in active transport at post-intervention. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity participation also increased by an estimated 2 min/day (CI: -21, 26) and 12 min/week (CI: -154, 180), but this trend was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: We recommend that support be provided to older adults transitioning to telehealth, especially as migration to telehealth progresses.	Prevention
34133856	Tofacitinib in Patients Hospitalized with Covid-19 Pneumonia. BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, in patients who are hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia are unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, hospitalized adults with Covid-19 pneumonia to receive either tofacitinib at a dose of 10 mg or placebo twice daily for up to 14 days or until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was the occurrence of death or respiratory failure through day 28 as assessed with the use of an eight-level ordinal scale (with scores ranging from 1 to 8 and higher scores indicating a worse condition). All-cause mortality and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients underwent randomization at 15 sites in Brazil. Overall, 89.3% of the patients received glucocorticoids during hospitalization. The cumulative incidence of death or respiratory failure through day 28 was 18.1% in the tofacitinib group and 29.0% in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.97; P = 0.04). Death from any cause through day 28 occurred in 2.8% of the patients in the tofacitinib group and in 5.5% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.15 to 1.63). The proportional odds of having a worse score on the eight-level ordinal scale with tofacitinib, as compared with placebo, was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.36 to 1.00) at day 14 and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.27 to 1.06) at day 28. Serious adverse events occurred in 20 patients (14.1%) in the tofacitinib group and in 17 (12.0%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia, tofacitinib led to a lower risk of death or respiratory failure through day 28 than placebo.

34206732	Modelling Analysis of COVID-19 Transmission and the State of Emergency in Japan. To assess the effectiveness of the containment strategies proposed in Japan, an SEIAQR (susceptible-exposed-infected-asymptomatic-quarantined-recovered) model was established to simulate the transmission of COVID-19. We divided the spread of COVID-19 in Japan into different stages based on policies. The effective reproduction number Re and the transmission parameters were determined to evaluate the measures conducted by the Japanese Government during these periods. On 7 April 2020, the Japanese authority declared a state of emergency to control the rapid development of the pandemic. Based on the simulation results, the spread of COVID-19 in Japan can be inhibited by containment actions during the state of emergency. The effective reproduction number Re reduced from 1.99 (before the state of emergency) to 0.92 (after the state of emergency). The transmission parameters were fitted and characterized with quantifiable variables including the ratio of untracked cases, the PCR test index and the proportion of COCOA app users (official contact confirming application). The impact of these variables on the control of COVID-19 was investigated in the modelling analysis. On 8 January 2021, the Japanese Government declared another state of emergency. The simulated results demonstrated that the spread could be controlled in May by keeping the same strategies. A higher intensity of PCR testing was suggested, and a larger proportion of COCOA app users should reduce the final number of infections and the time needed to control the spread of COVID-19.

34372581	Dynamic Assay for Profiling Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies and Their ACE2/Spike RBD Neutralization Capacity. Serological assays have been widely employed during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to measure antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to track seroconversion in populations. However, currently available assays do not allow determination of neutralization capacity within the assay protocol. Furthermore, commercial serology assays have a high buy-in cost that is inaccessible for many research groups. We have replicated the serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody isotypes, developed at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York. Additionally, we have modified the protocol to include a neutralization assay with only a minor modification to this protocol. We used this assay to screen local COVID-19 patient sera (n = 91) and pre-COVID-19 control sera (n = 103), and obtained approximate parity with approved commercial anti-nucleoprotein-based assays with these sera. Furthermore, data from our neutralization assay closely aligns with that generated using a spike-based pseudovirus infection model when a subset of patient sera was analyzed.	Diagnosis
34293147	Time and belief in exercise importance predict increased activity during initial COVID-19 restrictions in Ireland. The aim of this work was to investigate physical activity levels and the associated barriers and facilitators to physical activity in Irish adults during initial COVID-19 restrictions. Members of the general population completed an online questionnaire. Responses from 1274 participants (1274/1568, 81% completion rate) indicated that the majority (46.1%, n = 587) of people were more active than usual during the restrictions, however, 28.6% (n = 365) reported being less active. Fifty-five percent (55.3%, n = 702) of participants were meeting public health physical activity guidelines and more than half (53.3%, n = 679) reported finding new ways to be active. Walking (86%, n = 1101), physical activity in the home (47%, n = 593) and online resources (38%, n = 483) were most frequently reported. Having more time to be physically active [OR 2.326 (SD 1.948-2.794)] and a greater belief in the importance of physical activity [OR 1.192 (SD 1.001-1.444)] were predictive of exercising more than usual. Being unable to access their usual means of exercise [OR 1.612 (SD 1.369-1.902)], advised not to go outside the home [OR 1.402 (SD 1.165-1.698)] and working more than usual [OR 1.201 (SD 1.013-1.443)] were predictive of exercising less than usual. There was a positive trend in physical activity engagement by Irish adults during initial COVID-19 restrictions, likely influenced by governmental decisions permitting people to leave their homes to exercise and increased use of home-based and online exercise resources. However, almost one in three people reported being less active than usual, highlighting the need for targeted support during restriction periods.	Prevention
34287390	Knowledge and Perceptions about COVID-19 among Health Care Workers: Evidence from COVID-19 Hospitals during the Second Pandemic Wave. Health care workers (HCWs) face a higher risk of infection, since they work at the front line of COVID-19 patients' management. Misinterpretations of current scientific evidence among HCWs may impact the delivery of appropriate care to COVID-19 patients and increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the hospital setting. Moreover, knowledge may affect HCWs perceptions depending on their broad beliefs and past experiences. The aim of this study was to explore the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs regarding COVID-19 issues during the second wave of the pandemic. A cross-sectional survey, involving a printed questionnaire, was conducted from 21 October 2020 to 31 January 2021 in four tertiary care hospitals located at four distant geographical regions in Greece. In total, 294 HCWs participated in this study. The majority of HCWs provided precise responses regarding general knowledge, perceptions, and practices concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. However, responses on hand hygiene and antimicrobial use in HCWs with COVID-19 were mistaken. This study reveals a certain degree of misconceptions and knowledge gaps in HCWs everyday practice, especially regarding hand hygiene and antimicrobial use in COVID-19 patients.	Prevention
34228187	[COVID-19 outbreak investigation in a geriatric palliative hospital]. BACKGROUND: During the second COVID-19 wave, a large COVID-19 outbreak happened at a 90-bed geriatric palliative care hospital in December 2020, whereby 32% of the healthcare personnel (HCP) and 29 patients became infected within 23 days and 13 patients died. The bed occupancy rate dropped to 20%. Drastically enhanced hygiene measures directly after outbreak detection could stop further nosocomial infections among patients but were less effective among HCP. OBJECTIVE: Outbreak investigation and detection of risk factors for infection in HCP. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Anonymous online survey among HCP from January and February 2021 investigating potential risk factors for PCR positive infections (poorly fitting FFP2 masks, close contacts with positive patients, team meetings with positive HCP). RESULTS: Of 184 HCP, 96 completed the survey (52.2%), including 38 who became infected. Of the HCP 8 remained asymptomatic/oligosymptomatic, 30 HCP became ill for a median of 10 days and in 2 continuously. Factors associated with an infection were close contacts with positive patients in a time-dependent manner despite wearing an FFP2 mask (OR 6.0; 95% CI 1.6-22). Out of 88 HCP 55 described poorly fitting FFP2 masks. An infection was mostly attributed to a longer contact with positive, sometimes restless patients. The overall exhausting working situation was repeatedly mentioned. CONCLUSION: A COVID outbreak within the care-intense geriatric context is challenging to control especially among HCP. Longer patient contacts and limited compliance by patients counteracts strict hygiene measures. Vulnerability of HCP and patients requires additional preventive interventions by rapidly effective vaccinations and has to be a priority for health policy.	Prevention
34219187	Ability and willingness to utilize telemedicine among rheumatology patients-a cross-sectional survey. INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the patients' ability and willingness to utilize telemedicine (TM) along with identifying some of the barriers to a more widespread adoption of TM in rheumatology. METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional study of patients visiting a rheumatology clinic was conducted in 2018. We used a survey to assess patients' attitude on the perceived effectiveness when comparing TM versus in-person visits, as well as patients' access to technology, distance traveled by the patient to attend the clinic visit, and demographic parameters. RESULTS: A total of 214 patients were included. Negative correlations were found between the increase in age and access to technologies (front-facing camera (mean age difference - 12.8), telephone (mean age difference - 14.4), and stable internet connection (mean age difference - 15.1)), as well as believing that their needs could be met through TM (r - .224, p < 0.001) and thinking that TM could be an appropriate alternative method of healthcare (r - .298, p < 0.001). Younger patients reported more conflict between appointments and work hours (mean age difference - 11.73). Follow-up patients were more likely to feel that their visit could have been possible over the phone (mean difference - 1.13) or video conferencing (mean difference - 1.13) compared to new patients. Older patients were less likely to think that the purpose of their rheumatology visits could be achieved over the phone (r - .207, p = 0.003) or video conferencing (r - .331, p = 0.001). The further the distance traveled, the more the patients were willing to utilize TM compared to in-person visits (r 0.167, p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Out of necessity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, rheumatology clinics are increasingly turning to TM. The results of this study suggest that access and familiarity with technology may still be limited in certain demographics, particularly the elderly. Furthermore, this study helps to understand some of the additional barriers to more widespread adoption and patients' perceived limitations of TM. Key Points * This study aimed to assess rheumatology patients' willingness to utilize telemedicine (TM) while determining the factors and barriers that may exist for a more widespread adoption of TM, using a cross-sectional survey in the setting of a rheumatologic clinic. * The age of the patient was the most significant contributing factor in a patient's perception of TM, with older patients being less likely to think that the purpose of their rheumatology visits could be achieved over the phone or via videoconferencing. * The social trend of limited access to technology among the elderly population was reinforced by the results in this study. * Patients who had a greater commute to the clinic were more likely to willing to utilize TM consultations. * The results of this study highlight the elevated difficulty elderly patient populations have in utilizing TM. * With the current outbreak of COVID-19, the importance of utilizing TM specifically among the elderly population could prove vital. Future studies to focus on the elderly population and methods for helping these patients become familiar with TM would be beneficial. * Studies such as this can help to orchestrate future guidelines for TM in the field of rheumatology. Based on our study results, the new-patient encounter should be an in-person face-to-face encounter whenever possible, followed by TM visits for established patients who are able and open to using it, depending on the diagnosis and symptoms of the individual patients.

34227364	"[Applications of separation technology in novel coronavirus research, epidemic prevention and detection]. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has brought to light unprecedented challenges to global public health security. Researchers have devoted their efforts to in-depth research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to bring the epidemic under control as rapidly as possible. Among the many areas of burgeoning SARS-CoV-2 related research, various analytical technologies have been applied to the advancement of virus detection, and development of vaccines and innovative therapies. Separation technologies with the merits of simple operation, high separation efficiency, and high selectivity, have become widely used and are key to progress in life science, medicine, pharmaceutical discovery and development, and other fields. Separation technologies have played an irreplaceable role in the isolation, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this novel coronavirus. In this review, an overview of the relevant literature is presented from ISI Web of Science spanning Jan. 1st, 2020-Dec. 31, 2020, using ""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""COVID-19"" as keywords. The top 20 research directions are summarized, based on papers published in high impact international journals (e. g. Nature, Science, and Cell). Incorporating the impact of published papers, this review summarizes the primary separation technologies applied in these coronavirus studies, and discusses contributions of the following six technologies: affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography, liquid chromatography, magnetic bead separation technology, centrifugal technology, micro/nano-separation technology, and electrophoresis. First, affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography are discussed, which are the most frequently used protein purification techniques in Nature, Science, and Cell. The SARS-CoV-2 related proteins purified by affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography are summarized, and their applications in coronavirus transmission, infection mechanisms, and drug screening are introduced. Subsequently, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is introduced, which is mainly employed for assessing the purity of candidate drugs. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) incorporates the strengths of HPLC and MS, offering both high separation efficiency and structural analysis capabilities with extended applications. LC-MS/MS has been applied to characterization of the binding of SARS-CoV-2 related proteins to potential inhibitors, and to metabolic analyses of candidate drugs. In SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests, magnetic bead separation technology plays a crucial role in the separation of novel coronaviruses. In combination with other analytical techniques, magnetic bead separation technology can be applied to cytological analyses and immunological detection by functionalization of bead surfaces. Centrifugal technology is undoubtedly the most basic separation technology. It has been employed in almost all SARS-CoV-2 related researches. By controlling centrifugation speed, centrifugal technology can rapidly isolate virus particles or cultured cells from complex samples. Micro-nano separation technologies, such as microfluidics, offer advantages including small size, low sample consumption, rapid diffusion, and large surface area. In general, microfluidic technologies are often used in combination with other technologies to realize highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 related proteins. Finally, the applications of electrophoresis are introduced, which commonly engages in the analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. In novel coronavirus studies, the application of electrophoresis has been relatively limited but has potential with further development to contribute significantly to future research. In conclusion, this review summarizes the contributions of six primary separation technologies to novel coronavirus studies, including epidemic detection and prevention, analyzes the main problems facing coronavirus detection efforts, and discusses the role of separation technologies in addressing these problems, with the aim of providing references for broader application of separation technologies."

34366657	SARS-CoV-2 infection: a global outbreak and its implication on public health. Background: A novel corona virus is formally named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which results in causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is the latest prevalent pandemic worldwide when compared to other infectious diseases like Avian flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Main body: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently occurring pandemic over world. It was emerged in Wuhan, China, in the end of December 2019 and spreading across worldwide. As the coronavirus is spreading easily through direct contact with infected people droplets, inhalation, and also air droplets, it hit up a huge amount of population even reported with death. Still, with small amounts of asymptomatic transmission between people it spreads throughout the globe. People need special care to protect from the transmission of disease. However, there are no drugs so far that shows efficacy; there is an immediate need for the development of vaccines. In order to decrease the COVID-19 cases, organizations rapidly involve in the preparation of vaccine and many vaccines have been developed by various countries. The governments took safety measures to control the spread of virus and also to minimize morbidity and mortality rate to least possible. Conclusion: The purpose of this review article is to increase our understanding of COVID-19 and facilitate the people to take a move in facing challenges of the world.	Prevention;Treatment;Mechanism
34354803	"Acute mesenteric ischemia and small bowel imaging findings in COVID-19: A comprehensive review of the literature. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious condition caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread worldwide since its first description in Wuhan in December 2019. Even though respiratory manifestations are the most prevalent and responsible for disease morbidity and mortality, extrapulmonary involvement has progressively gained relevance. In particular, gastrointestinal (GI) signs and symptoms, reported in up to two-thirds of patients with COVID-19, might represent the first and, in some cases, the only disease presentation. Their presence has been associated in some studies with an increased risk of a severe disease course. Proposed pathogenic mechanisms explaining GI tract involvement are either direct viral access to intestinal cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or indirect damage of the intestinal wall through mesenteric ischemia induced by the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 infection. Although not typical of SARS-CoV-2 infection, several small bowel manifestations have been described in infected patients who underwent any form of abdominal imaging. The radiological findings were mainly reported in patients with abdominal symptoms, among which abdominal pain was the most common. AIM: To discuss small bowel radiological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in abdominal imaging studies. METHODS: Bibliographical searches were performed in PubMed, using the following keywords: ""COVID-19"" AND ""imaging"" AND ""gastrointestinal"" OR ""abdominal"" OR ""small bowel"". RESULTS: Of 62 patients with described radiologic small bowel alterations, mesenteric ischemia was diagnosed in 31 cases (50%), small bowel wall thickening in 10 cases (16%), pneumatosis in nine cases (15%), intussusception in eight cases (13%), pneumoperitoneum in two cases (3%) and paralytic ileus in two cases (3%). We also reported mesenteric adipose tissue hypertrophy and lymph nodes enlargement in a young woman. CONCLUSION: So far it is difficult to establish whether these manifestations are the direct consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or collateral findings in infected patients, but their recognition would be pivotal to set a closer follow-up and to reduce missed diagnoses."

34219860	Computer-Aided-Diagnosis as a Service on Decentralized Medical Cloud for Efficient and Rapid Emergency Response Intelligence. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant increase in the workload for the emergency systems and healthcare providers all around the world. The emergency systems are dealing with large number of patients in various stages of deteriorating conditions which require significant medical expertise for accurate and rapid diagnosis and treatment. This issue will become more prominent in places with lack of medical experts and state-of-the-art clinical equipment, especially in developing countries. The machine intelligence aided medical diagnosis systems can provide rapid, dependable, autonomous, and low-cost solutions for medical diagnosis in emergency conditions. In this paper, a privacy-preserving computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) framework, called Decentralized deep Emergency response Intelligence (D-EI), which provides secure machine learning based medical diagnosis on the cloud is proposed. The proposed framework provides a blockchain based decentralized machine learning solution to aid the health providers with medical diagnosis in emergency conditions. The D-EI uses blockchain smart contracts to train the CAD machine learning models using all the data on the medical cloud while preserving the privacy of patients' records. Using the proposed framework, the data of each patient helps to increase the overall accuracy of the CAD model by balancing the diagnosis datasets with minority classes and special cases. As a case study, the D-EI is demonstrated as a solution for COVID-19 diagnosis. The D-EI framework can help in pandemic management by providing rapid and accurate diagnosis in overwhelming medical workload conditions.	Diagnosis
34352474	COVID-19, the first pandemic in the post-genomic era. The scale of the international efforts to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes is unprecedented. Early availability of genomes allowed rapid characterisation of the virus, thus kickstarting many highly successful vaccine development programmes. Worldwide genomic resources have provided a good understanding of the pandemic, supported close monitoring of the emergence of viral genomic diversity and pinpointed those sites to prioritise for functional characterisation. Continued genomic surveillance of global viral populations will be crucial to inform the timing of vaccine updates so as to pre-empt the spread of immune escape lineages. While genome sequencing has provided us with an exceptionally powerful tool to monitor the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, there is room for further improvements in particular in the form of less heterogeneous global surveillance and tools to rapidly identify concerning viral lineages.

34289652	Current Infection Prevention and Control Strategies of COVID-19 in Hospitals. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been appeared first in China since December 2019. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily with droplets through coughing and sneezing, is also occurs through inhalation of aerosolized secretions, which travel, remain suspended in the air longer. Since early in the outbreak, have described COVID-19 cases in healthcare workers (HCWs). In the early stages of the disease, there may be asymptomatic. This may lead to incorrect diagnosis or delayed diagnosis and may lead to the nosocomial spread of the virus. One of the most important causes of transmission among HCWs is an aerosolized virus in a closed environment for a long time. It is possible to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals with outpatient treatment and triage. Infection control measures, including wearing surgical masks, hand hygiene, and social distance, are considered essential in preventing human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2. Immediate response and practices of infection control measures are critical for saving lives during an epidemic inside and outside the hospital. Analyzing current knowledge about the features of SARS-CoV-2 infection, screening, personal protection protocols, triage and psychological support practices for healthcare professionals can be promising in terms of controlling the infection.

34226811	Modeling the spread of COVID-19 in New York City. This paper proposes an ensemble predictor for the weekly increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the city of New York at zip code level. Within a Bayesian model averaging framework, the baseline is a Poisson regression for count data. The set of covariates includes autoregressive terms, spatial effects, and demographic and socioeconomic variables. Our results for the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic show that these regressors are more significant to predict the number of new confirmed cases as the pandemic unfolds. Both pointwise and interval forecasts exhibit strong predictive ability in-sample and out-of-sample.	Epidemic Forecasting
34207263	COVID-19 Changed the Incidence and the Pattern of Pediatric Traumas: A Single-Centre Study in a Pediatric Emergency Department. The first wave of COVID-19 spread worldwide from March to May 2020. Italy was one of the countries in the world where the lockdown period was most prolonged and restrictive. To date, the impact of prolonged lockdown on pediatric traumas has not fully investigated. This paper aimed to analyze, and compare to 2019, the incidence and the fracture pattern in patients admitted to our pediatric hospital during the total lockdown period. A single-center retrospective study was performed. The data were gathered from the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) of the Bambino Gesu Children Hospital of Rome (Palidoro). This PED is the pediatric referral center for Rome and the hub for pediatric traumas of the region. Any admission diagnosis for fracture, trauma, sprains and dislocation during the lockdown period (10 March-4 May) were included. The demographic data, diagnosis, type of treatment, fracture segment, bone involvement and time interval between trauma and presentation to the PED were recorded. In 2020, a reduction of total traumas and fractures, compared to 2019 (p < 0.001), occurred (81%). Superior limb and inferior limb fractures decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 (p < 0.05). The identification of pediatric traumas and fractures trend could be useful to reorganize the PED. Epidemiological data from the previous lockdown could be helpful to prepare the healthcare system for new pandemic waves. Moreover, sharing national statistics and correlating those to other countries' protocols, could be helpful to solve problems in case of worldwide emergency situations.	Prevention
34199138	Has Otitis Media Disappeared during COVID-19 Pandemic? A Fortuitus Effect of Domestic Confinement. BACKGROUND: To measure patient flow at our Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) during the Italian lockdown, with particular care in terms of otolaryngological (ENT)-related diagnoses. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of electronic charts of children admitted to our PED in the City Center of Milan (Italy) for any disease. The outcome was to compare distribution of diagnoses performed at our PED during 21 February-3 May 2019 (period 1) to 21 February-3 May 2020 (period 2). RESULTS: A total of 4538 children were evaluated during period 1 compared to 1310 during period 2. A statistically significant overall effect on diagnosis between the study periods was attested (p-value < 0.001; pseudo R2 = 0.010), ENT-related diagnoses being more frequently documented in period 1 (80.4% vs. 19.5%; p-value < 0.001), as well as those related to middle ear infections (92.8% vs. 7.2%; p-value < 0.001). Non-complicated acute otitis media more frequently occurred in period 1 (92.0% vs. 8.0%; p-value < 0.001); no significant difference in the number of complicated middle ear infections occurred (95.8% vs. 4.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The exceptional circumstances of the Italian lockdown resulted in a significant decrease in patients' attendance to our PED, especially when considering diagnoses related to any ENT disorder, middle ear disease, and non-complicated middle ear infection.

34222852	Roles of existing drug and drug targets for COVID-19 management. In December 2019, a highly transmissible, pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), erupted in China and other countries, resulting in devastation and health crisis worldwide currently. The search and using existing drugs support to curb the current highly contagious viral infection is spirally increasing since the pandemic began. This is based on these drugs had against other related RNA-viruses such as MERS-Cov, and SARS-Cov. Moreover, researchers are scrambling to identify novel drug targets and discover novel therapeutic options to vanquish the current pandemic. Since there is no definitive treatment to control Covid-19 vaccines are remain to be a lifeline. Currently, many vaccine candidates are being developed with most of them are reported to have positive results. Therapeutic targets such as helicases, transmembrane serine protease 2, cathepsin L, cyclin G-associated kinase, adaptor-associated kinase 1, two-pore channel, viral virulence factors, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, suppression of excessive inflammatory response, inhibition of viral membrane, nucleocapsid, envelope, and accessory proteins, and inhibition of endocytosis were identified as a potential target against COVID-19 infection. This review also summarizes plant-based medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 such as saposhnikoviae divaricata, lonicerae japonicae flos, scutellaria baicalensis, lonicera japonicae, and some others. Thus, this review aimed to focus on the most promising therapeutic targets being repurposed against COVID-19 and viral elements that are used in COVID-19 vaccine candidates.	Mechanism;Treatment
34210688	Operationalisation of consensual One Health roadmaps in countries for improved IHR capacities and health security. The COVID-19 pandemic is a devastating reminder that mitigating the threat of emerging zoonotic outbreaks relies on our collective capacity to work across human health, animal health and environment sectors. Despite the critical need for shared approaches, collaborative benchmarks in the International Health Regulations (IHR) Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and more specifically the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) often reveal low levels of performance in collaborative technical areas (TAs), thus identifying a real need to work on the human-animal-environment interface to improve health security. The National Bridging Workshops (NBWs) proposed jointly by the World Organisation of Animal Health and World Health Organization (WHO) provide opportunity for national human health, animal health, environment and other relevant sectors in countries to explore the efficiency and gaps in their coordination for the management of zoonotic diseases. The results, gathered in a prioritised roadmap, support the operationalisation of the recommendations made during JEE for TAs where a multisectoral One Health approach is beneficial. For those collaborative TAs (12 out of 19 in the JEE), more than two-thirds of the recommendations can be implemented through one or multiple activities jointly agreed during NBW. Interestingly, when associated with the WHO Benchmark Tool for IHR, it appears that NBW activities are often associated with lower level of performance than anticipated during the JEE missions, revealing that countries often overestimate their capacities at the human-animal-environment interface. Deeper, more focused and more widely shared discussions between professionals highlight the need for concrete foundations of multisectoral coordination to meet goals for One Health and improved global health security through IHR.

34373729	Immune thrombocytopenia, severe hematological consequence in a patient with COVID-19: A case report. Since the first appearance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), multiple studies have focused on this novel coronavirus. Within a few months, the clinical and paraclinical manifestations and the mechanisms by which these changes are induced were elaborated. Clinically, the virus mainly causes the common cold, but can also result in severe or fatal pneumonia/acute respiratory syndrome. Regarding the biological changes, similar to any other virus, it can lead to a reduced lymphocyte count. The second most common change is represented by a reduced thrombocyte count. Furthermore, most patients have blood clotting abnormalities, inflammatory syndrome, raised D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Detection of immune thrombocytopenia in asymptomatic patients who tested positive for COVID-19 justifies the need to perform differential diagnosis and testing for COVID-19. Typically, patients with severe forms of COVID-19 develop mild thrombocytopenia, while severe thrombocytopenia is rarely reported. The aim of this case report was to present the situation in which one asymptomatic patient who tested positive for COVID-19 developed severe immune thrombocytopenia.	Case Report
34226880	A multi-centre survey reveals variations in the standard treatments and treatment modifications for head and neck cancer patients during Covid-19 pandemic. Background: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid changes to the practice of head and neck oncology in UK. There was a delay between the onset of the pandemic and the release of guidelines from cancer societies and networks, leading to a variable response of individual centres. This survey was conducted to assess the pre-Covid-19 pandemic standard of practice for head and neck oncology patients and the treatment modifications introduced during the first wave of the pandemic in UK. Methodology: The UK National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Head and Neck Clinical Studies Group initiated a multi-centre survey using questionnaire to investigate the effect on feeding tube practice, radiotherapy (RT) fractionation and volumes, use of chemotherapy in the neo-adjuvant, concurrent and palliative setting, the use of immunotherapy in the palliative setting, access to radiology and histopathology services, and availability of surgical procedures. Results: 30 centres were approached across UK; 23 (76.7%) centres responded and were included in the survey. There were differences in the standard practices in feeding tube policy, RT dose and fractionation as well as concurrent chemotherapy use. 21 (91%) participating centres had at least one treatment modification. 15 (65%) centres initiated a change in radical RT; changing to either a hypofractionation or acceleration schedule. For post-operative RT 10 centres (43.5%) changed to a hypofractionation schedule. 12 (52.2%) centres stopped neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for all patients; 13 (56.5%) centres followed selective omission of chemotherapy in concurrent chemo-radiotherapy patients, 17 (73.9%) centres changed first-line chemotherapy treatment to pembrolizumab (following NHS England's interim guidance) and 8 (34.8%) centres stopped the treatment early or offered delays for patients that have been already on systemic treatment. The majority of centres did not have significant changes associated with surgery, radiology, histopathology and dental screening. Conclusion: There are variations in the standard of practice and treatment modifications for head and neck cancer patients during Covid-19 pandemic. A timely initiative is required to form a consensus on head and neck cancer management in the UK and other countries.	Prevention
34219142	Tracking the pipeline: immunoinformatics and the COVID-19 vaccine design. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of data on genomic and proteomic sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) stored in various databases has exponentially grown. A large volume of these data has led to the production of equally immense sets of immunological data, which require rigorous computational approaches to sort through and make sense of. Immunoinformatics has emerged in the recent decades as a field capable of offering this approach by bridging experimental and theoretical immunology with state-of-the-art computational tools. Here, we discuss how immunoinformatics can assist in the development of high-performance vaccines and drug discovery needed to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Immunoinformatics can provide a set of computational tools to extract meaningful connections from the large sets of COVID-19 patient data, which can be implemented in the design of effective vaccines. With this in mind, we represent a pipeline to identify the role of immunoinformatics in COVID-19 treatment and vaccine development. In this process, a number of free databases of protein sequences, structures and mutations are introduced, along with docking web servers for assessing the interaction between antibodies and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein segments as most commonly considered antigens in vaccine design.

34365895	Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DG enhances the lactoferrin anti-SARS-CoV-2 response in Caco-2 cells. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which primarily manifests with respiratory distress and may also lead to symptoms associated with the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics are living microorganisms that have been shown to confer immune benefits. In this study, we investigated the immunomodulatory effects and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of three different Lacticaseibacillus probiotic strains, either alone or in combination with lactoferrin, using the intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cell line. Our results revealed that the Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DG strain significantly induced the expression of genes involved in protective antiviral immunity and prevented the expression of proinflammatory genes triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, L. paracasei DG significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. L. paracasei DG also positively affected the antiviral immune activity of lactoferrin and significantly augmented its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Overall, our work shows that the probiotic strain L. paracasei DG is a promising candidate that exhibits prophylactic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Mechanism;Treatment
34211774	Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients and health professionals of a radiation oncology department at a Spanish tertiary hospital. Background: The sanitary emergency created by the COVID-19 pandemic forced us to take exceptional measures that affect decision-making and administration of treatments with radiotherapy. The aim of the study was to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients and professionals in a radiation oncology department. Materials and methods: We implement a plan with the objectives of maintaining radiotherapy treatment in those patients who need it and, at the same time, reducing the risk of spreading the virus to staff and patients. This plan included measures aimed at limiting the patient's stay in hospital, selecting those patients in whom radiotherapy cannot be delayed and protecting against infection through the use of physical protective measures. Results: Between March 16 and May 31, 2020, 360 patients received radiotherapy in our department. In 14 patients (4.7%) the start of treatment was delayed by an average of 28 days. Four patients had a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR ) (6.6% and 1.1% of tested and all patients, respectively). Among the professionals, two PCR s were positive (16.6% and 4% of tested and all individuals, respectively). In the serology analysis 4 out of 50 department members were IgG positive (8%). Conclusions: Despite the fact that our department is located in a region with a high incidence of COVID-19 infection, the impact of the pandemic on our patients and staff has been moderate. The implementation of measures against infection and an adequate selection of patients for treatment allows radiation oncology departments to maintain clinical activity.	Prevention
34222257	Sphingolipids as Modulators of SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic with severe consequences for afflicted individuals and the society as a whole. The biology and infectivity of the virus has been intensively studied in order to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of virus-host cell interactions during infection. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via its spike protein. Priming of the virus by specific proteases leads to viral entry via endocytosis and to the subsequent steps in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Sphingosine and ceramide belong to the sphingolipid family and are abundantly present in cell membranes. These lipids were recently shown to interfere with the uptake of virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 into epithelial cell lines and primary human nasal cells in culture. The mechanisms of action were partly different, as sphingosine blocked, whilst ceramide facilitated viral entry. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is vital for the generation of ceramide and functional inhibition of ASM by drugs like amitriptyline reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry into the epithelial cells. Recent data indicates that serum level of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a prognostic factor for COVID-2 severity. Further, stimulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) might also constrain the hyper-inflammatory conditions linked to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we review recent exciting findings regarding sphingolipids in the uptake of SARS-CoV-2 and in the course of COVID-19 disease. More studies are required on the mechanisms of action and the potential use of antidepressant drugs and sphingolipid modifiers in SARS-CoV-2 infections and in the treatment of the more serious and fatal consequences of the disease.

34345767	COVID-19 and Aspiration Pneumonia: Similar Pulmonary Findings with Different Diagnoses-a Pitfall in [18F]FDG PET/CT. Since December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide pandemic. Especially in the centers most affected by the pandemic, symptoms (such as fever, cough, myalgia, or fatigue) and/or radiological signs (such as ground-glass opacity) typically related to COVID-19 often diverted clinicians' attention from other diseases. Despite the urgency to recognize and cure SARS-CoV-2 infection, a plethora of differential diagnoses must be considered, and other diseases must be equally and promptly treated, as described in this case report.

34211788	New-Onset Bullous Pemphigoid in a COVID-19 Patient. This manuscript presents a report of bullous pemphigoid rash associated with COVID-19 for the first time. The objective of this manuscript is to present a unique dermatological case in the setting of a COVID-19-positive infection to further recognize the virus symptomatology. A 37-year-old female with a past medical history of class III obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, and hypertension presented to the emergency department in September 2020 with inpatient and outpatient follow-up through to November 2020. The patient denied any personal or family history of skin disorders. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 prior to hospitalization and presented to the hospital with severe, persistent, pruritic rash meeting dermatopathological, serologic, and clinical criteria for bullous pemphigoid diagnosis. Histopathology H&E punch biopsy from her left flexor wrist demonstrated epidermal keratinocyte necrosis, subepidermal vesiculation with eosinophils, gossamer stranding of the papillary dermis, and subepidermal edema. Direct immunofluorescence punch biopsy from her left flexor wrist demonstrated strong linear IgG staining at the dermoepidermal junction, with weaker and focal linear C3 staining. Antigen-specific serology was consistent with bullous pemphigoid. There was no previously reported cutaneous association of COVID-19 infection with bullous pemphigoid making this case an important addition to the body of evidence helping to identify bullous pemphigoid in the setting of viral infection.

34207369	Safety of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccine: Independent Evidence from Two EU States. Recent reports of thrombosis following AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in young females (<55 years-old) led to temporary suspension and urgent investigation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that concluded that vaccine benefits still outweigh its side effects (SEs). Therefore, this study aims to provide early independent evidence on the vaccine SEs' prevalence and their potential risk factors; a cross-sectional survey-based study was carried out between February and March 2021 in Germany and Czech Republic among healthcare workers who recently received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. The study used a validated self-administered questionnaire composed of twenty-eight multiple-choice items covering demographic variables, medical anamneses, and local, systemic, oral, and skin related SEs of the vaccine. Out of the ninety-two included participants, 77.2% were females and 79.3% were from Germany. Their mean age was 35.37 +/- 12.62 (19-64) years-old, 15.2% had chronic illnesses and 22.8% were receiving medical treatments. Overall, 94.6% of the participants reported at least one SE. The most common local SE was injection site pain (72.8%), and the most common systemic SEs were fatigue (73.9%), muscle pain (55.4%), chills (48.9%), feeling unwell (46.7%), nausea (45.7%), and headache (29.3%). The vast majority (91.9%) resolved within 1-3 days, and the below 35 years-old group was the least affected age group. The SEs' frequency was insignificantly higher in females and previously infected participants; the vaccine safety for the elderly was supported by the early findings of this study. Chronic illnesses and medical treatments were not associated with an increased risk of SE incidence and frequency. No blood disorder SEs were reported in our sample. Further independent studies are highly required to evaluate the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine and to explore whether gender or previous infection could be associated with the vaccine SEs.

34376920	"Forecasting the impact of environmental stresses on the frequent waves of COVID19. A novel approach to link the environmental stresses with the COVID-19 cases is adopted during this research. The time-dependent data are extracted from the online repositories that are freely available for knowledge and research. Since the time series data analysis is desired for the COVID-19 time-dependent frequent waves, here in this manuscript, we have developed a time series model with the aid of ""nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX)"" approach. The distribution of infectious agent-containing droplets from an infected person to an uninfected person is a common form of respiratory disease transmission. SARS-CoV-2 has mainly spread via short-range respiratory droplet transmission. Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to have occurred over long distances or times in unusual conditions; SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in PM10 collected in Italy. This research shows that SARS-CoV-2 particles adsorbed to outdoor PM remained viable for a long time, given the epidemiology of COVID-19, outdoor air pollution is unlikely to be a significant route of transmission. In this research, ANN time series is used to analyze the data resulting from the COVID-19 first and second waves and the forecasted results show that air pollution affects people in different areas of Italy and make more people sick with covid-19. The model is developed based on the disease transmission data of Italy."	Transmission
34202471	Perceived Benefits Matter the Most in COVID-19 Preventive Behaviors: Empirical Evidence from Okara District, Pakistan. The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has affected the social determinants of health, worsening health inequities and deteriorating healthcare capacities around the globe. The objective of this study is to investigate the COVID-19 prevention behaviors within the framework of the Health Belief Model in the city of Depalpur in the Okara District of Pakistan in May 2020. Using an observational, cross-sectional, and quantitative study design, a face-to-face field survey was conducted during the epidemic of COVID-19 in district Okara, Pakistan. A sample of 500 adults was selected from the city of Depalpur the in Okara district of Pakistan, using a two-stage sampling design with cluster sampling in stage one and systematic random sampling at stage two. A COVID-19 prevention behavior scale was computed based on twelve dichotomous items. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and negative binomial regression analyses were performed. The most common prevention behavior among study participants was avoiding going for walks in the parks (81.0%), followed by not leaving home during the lockdown (72.6%), and washing hands every day with soap and water for 20 s after going out of their home (64.0%). Fewer people exhibited prevention behaviors such as social distancing (e.g., staying at least six feet away from other people) which in the EU was recommended to be a minimum of 1.5-2 m (44.4%) and following all of the basic protective measures (e.g., hand washing, use of a face covering in public, social distancing) in order to protect against COVID-19 (33.0%). The results from the negative binomial regression analysis showed that after controlling for the other HBM constructs and sociodemographic factors, only the perceived benefits of preventative actions showed significant association with the prevention behavior scale (IRR, 1.16; CI, 1.061-1.276; p < 0.001). The study findings show that public health interventions attempting to control the spread of COVID-19 in Pakistan may want to affect a change in people's perceived benefits of preventative actions through mass awareness-raising campaigns.

34202259	Sub-3 A Cryo-EM Structures of Necrosis Virus Particles via the Use of Multipurpose TEM with Electron Counting Camera. During this global pandemic, cryo-EM has made a great impact on the structure determination of COVID-19 proteins. However, nearly all high-resolution results are based on data acquired on state-of-the-art microscopes where their availability is restricted to a number of centers across the globe with the studies on infectious viruses being further regulated or forbidden. One potential remedy is to employ multipurpose microscopes. Here, we investigated the capability of 200 kV multipurpose microscopes equipped with a direct electron camera in determining the structures of infectious particles. We used 30 nm particles of the grouper nerve necrosis virus as a test sample and obtained the cryo-EM structure with a resolution as high as approximately 2.7 A from a setting that used electron counting. For comparison, we tested a high-end cryo-EM (Talos Arctica) using a similar virus (Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus) to obtain virtually the same resolution. Those results revealed that the resolution is ultimately limited by the depth of field. Our work updates the density maps of these viruses at the sub-3A level to allow for building accurate atomic models from de novo to provide structural insights into the assembly of the capsids. Importantly, this study demonstrated that multipurpose TEMs are capable of the high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination of infectious particles and is thus germane to the research on pandemics.

34215541	Telemedicine and cystic fibrosis: Do we still need face-to-face clinics? There has been growing interest in telemedicine for cystic fibrosis over recent years based largely on convenience for patients and/or increasing the frequency of surveillance and early detection which, it is assumed, could improve treatment outcomes. During 2020, the covid-19 pandemic catalysed the pace of development of this field, as CF patients were presumed to be at high risk of infection. Most clinics adapted to digital platforms with provision of lung function monitoring and sample collection systems. Here, we present the views of multidisciplinary team members at a large paediatric CF centre on what has worked well and what requires further optimisation in the future. In response to the question posed, 'Do we still need face to face clinics?' our answer is 'Yes, but not every time, and not for everyone'.	Prevention
34222849	Effect of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate and Emtricitabine on nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load burden amongst outpatients with COVID-19: A pilot, randomized, open-label phase 2 trial. Background: Tenofovir and emtricitabine interfere with the SARS CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Several cohorts reported that people treated by tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine are less likely to develop SARS CoV-2 infection and related severe COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a pilot randomized, open-label, controlled, phase 2 trial at two hospitals in France. Eligible patients were consecutive outpatients (aged >/=18 years) with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 7 days or less. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (2 pills on day 1 followed by 1 pill per day on days 2-7) or the standard of care. The primary and secondary endpoints were SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance from baseline assessed by cycle threshold (Ct) RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab collected at day 4 and day 7, respectively. A higher Ct corresponds to a lower SARS CoV-2 viral burden. Other endpoints were the time to recovery and the number of adverse events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04685512. Findings: From November, 20(th) 2020 to March, 19(th) 2021, 60 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (30 to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine and 30 to standard of care). The median number of days from symptom onset to inclusion was 4 days (IQR 3-5) in both groups. Amongst patients who received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the difference from standard of care in the increase in Ct RT-PCR from baseline was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [-0.6 to 5.2], p = 0.13) at day 4 and 2.9 (95% CI [0.1 to 5.2], p = 0.044) at day 7. At day 7, 6/30 in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine group and 3/30 in the standard of care group reported no COVID-related symptoms. Adverse events included 11 cases of gastrointestinal side effects (grade </= 2), three of which leaded to drug discontinuation. Three patients had COVID-19 related hospitalisation, no participant died. Interpretation: In this pilot study of outpatients adult with recent non-severe COVID-19, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine appeared to accelerate the natural clearance of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral burden. These findings support the conduct of larger trials of tenofovir-based therapies for the prevention and early treatment of COVID-19. Funding: No external funding.	Treatment
34224555	Impact of Covid-19 restrictions on carers of persons with dementia in the UK: A qualitative study. BACKGROUND: Informal carers provide the majority of the support for persons with dementia living at home. Restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 have had a profound impact on the daily life of the entire population. This study provides insight into the impact of these restrictions on carers of people with dementia living at home. DESIGN: Qualitative semi-structured interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sample of carers who provide at least 10 hours of care a week for the person with dementia living at home. SETTING: United Kingdom. RESULTS: Twenty-three carers were interviewed, and thematic analysis identified three main themes-Changes to daily life, impact on carer health and wellbeing and reduced support from health and social support networks. The results highlight the impact of restrictions imposed on daily life and routines due to the pandemic, wellbeing of carers, reduced social support, lack of access to health and care professionals and respite for carers. The restrictions have had negative consequences on carers' wellbeing, and they have experienced difficulties in accessing formal care services and respite care. CONCLUSION: Carers attempt to continue to provide physical, emotional and practical support for persons with dementia in the community throughout the COVID-19 restrictions. To prevent a future carer crisis, carers need better support systems including formal carer services, telecare solutions that work for them and additional support for respite, as the restrictions from this pandemic continue.

34207863	Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Governmental Containment Policies on the Detection and Therapy of Oral Malignant Lesions-A Retrospective, Multicenter Cohort Study from Germany. (1) Background: In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, governmental measures have been undertaken. The impact of the crisis on the healthcare of patients with cancer is largely unexplored. This multicenter cohort study aimed to investigate a potential screening delay and its consequences in patients with oral cancer (OC) during the pandemic. (2) Material and Methods: Data of patients who were first diagnosed with OC during different periods were collected, especially in terms of OC incidence, tumor stage/entity and time to intervention. The periods lockdown (LD) (13 March-16 June 2020), post-lockdown (PLD) (17 June-1 November 2020), and the corresponding equivalents in 2018/19 were differentiated and compared. (3) Results: There was no obvious trend towards a higher incidence of OC or higher tumor stages, whereas a trend towards a shorter time to intervention during the LD2020 could be observed. Subgroup analyses revealed an increased incidence in OC within the PLD2020 in Mainz, which might be explained by the partial closure of dental practices in this federal state during LD. (4) Conclusions: While there was no overall higher incidence of OC, we found closure of practices during LD to possibly delay cancer diagnosis. Therefore, measures must be taken to identify patients at risk and to ensure basic healthcare, especially in the context of dental screening measures.	Prevention
34224248	A review of neuroradiological abnormalities in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to various neurological manifestations. There is an urgent need for a summary of neuroimaging findings to accelerate diagnosis and treatment plans. We reviewed prospective and retrospective studies to classify neurological abnormalities observed in patients with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The relevant studies published in Scopus, PubMed and Clarivate Analytics databases were analysed. The search was performed for full-text articles published from 23 January 2020 to 23 February 2021. RESULTS: In 23 studies the number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 20,850 and the number of patients with neurological manifestations was 1996 (9.5%). The total number of patients with neuroradiological abnormalities was 602 (2.8%). SARS-CoV-2 has led to various neuroimaging abnormalities which can be categorised by neuroanatomical localisation of lesions and their main probable underlying pathogenesis. Cranial nerve and spinal root abnormalities were cranial neuritis and polyradiculitis. Parenchymal abnormalities fell into four groups of: (a) thrombosis disorders, namely ischaemic stroke and sinus venous thrombosis; (b) endothelial dysfunction and damage disorders manifested as various types of intracranial haemorrhage and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; (c) hypoxia/hypoperfusion disorders of leukoencephalopathy and watershed infarction; and (d) inflammatory disorders encompassing demyelinating disorders, encephalitis, vasculitis-like disorders, vasculopathy and cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum. Leptomeninges disorders included meningitis. Ischaemic stroke was the most frequent abnormality in these studies. CONCLUSION: The review study suggests that an anatomical approach to the classification of heterogeneous neuroimaging findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and neurological manifestations would lend itself well for use by practitioners in diagnosis and treatment planning.

34281489	Leucoefdin a potential inhibitor against SARS CoV-2 M(pro). Leucoefdin an important constituent of various fruits such as banana, raspberry, etc. was explored to target M(Pro) protease of SARS Co-V 2. Ligand was found to bind at active site of M(Pro) with large negative binding energies in molecular docking and simulation study. The docking results showed that Leucoefdin interacted with the M(Pro) by forming hydrogen bonds, at Leu 141, His163, His 164, and Glu 166. Other non-bonded interactions were seen at Met49, Pro52, Tyr54, Phe140, Leu141, Cys145 and Met165. Results of Leucoefdin was in coherence with the recently reported M(Pro) protease-inhibitor complex. It even displayed better binding energies (kcal/mol) in HTVS (-6.28), SP (-7.28), XP (-9.29) and MMGBSA (-44.71) as compared to the reference ligand [HTVS (-4.87), SP (-6.79), XP (-5.75) and MMGBSA (-47.76)]. Leucoefdin-M(Pro) complex on molecular dynamic simulation showed initial fluctuations in RMSD plot for a certain period and attained equilibrium which remained stable during entire simulation for 150 ns. RMSF of protein showed less secondary structure fluctuations and a greater number of H-bond formation with Leucoefdin during 150 ns simulation. Post simulation MMGBSA analysis showed binding energy of -45.98 Kcal/mol. These findings indicated the potential of Leucoefdin as lead compound in R&D for drug discovery and development against SARS CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.	Mechanism;Treatment
34289028	Patient-led Remote IntraCapillary pharmacoKinetic Sampling (fingerPRICKS) for therapeutic drug monitoring in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Because of COVID-19 public health restrictions, telemedicine has replaced conventional outpatient follow up for most patients with chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorders treated with biologic drugs. Innovative solutions to facilitate remote therapeutic drug monitoring are therefore required. Low-volume intracapillary blood sampling can be undertaken by patients at home and samples returned by post to central laboratories. We sought to report the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on requests for therapeutic drug monitoring and the equivalence, acceptability and effectiveness of low volume Patient-led Remote IntraCapillary pharmacoKinetic Sampling (fingerPRICKS) compared to conventional venepuncture. METHODS: We undertook a cross-sectional blood sampling methods comparison study and compared sample types using linear regression models. Drug and antidrug antibody levels were measured using standard ELISAs. Acceptability was assessed using a purpose-designed questionnaire. RESULTS: Therapeutic drug monitoring requests for adalimumab (96.5 [70.5 - 106] per week to 52 [33.5 - 57.0], p < 0.001) but not infliximab (184.5 [161.2 - 214.2] to 161 [135 - 197.5], p = 0.34) reduced during the first UK stay-at-home lockdown compared with the preceding six months.Fingerprick sampling was equivalent to conventional venepuncture for adalimumab, infliximab, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab drug, and anti-adalimumab and -infliximab antibody levels. The median (IQR) volume of serum obtained using intracapillary sampling was 195microL (130-210). More than 87% (90/103) patients agreed that intracapillary testing was easy and 69% (71/103) preferred it to conventional venepuncture.In routine care, 75.3% (58/77) patients returned two blood samples within 14 days to permit remote assessment of biologic therapeutic drug monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic drug monitoring can be undertaken using patient-led remote intracapillary blood sampling and has the potential to be a key adjunct to telemedicine in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

34204549	The Role of Coronavirus RNA-Processing Enzymes in Innate Immune Evasion. Viral RNA sensing triggers innate antiviral responses in humans by stimulating signaling pathways that include crucial antiviral genes such as interferon. RNA viruses have evolved strategies to inhibit or escape these mechanisms. Coronaviruses use multiple enzymes to synthesize, modify, and process their genomic RNA and sub-genomic RNAs. These include Nsp15 and Nsp16, whose respective roles in RNA capping and dsRNA degradation play a crucial role in coronavirus escape from immune surveillance. Evolutionary studies on coronaviruses demonstrate that genome expansion in Nidoviruses was promoted by the emergence of Nsp14-ExoN activity and led to the acquisition of Nsp15- and Nsp16-RNA-processing activities. In this review, we discuss the main RNA-sensing mechanisms in humans as well as recent structural, functional, and evolutionary insights into coronavirus Nsp15 and Nsp16 with a view to potential antiviral strategies.

34291313	Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome and brain haemorrhage as COVID-19 complication: a review of the available literature. BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with various neurological manifestations. Since patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection present coagulation and immune system dysregulation, ischemic or haemorragic stroke is not uncommon, irrespective of respiratory distress. However, the occurrence of focal neurological deficits together with other symptoms like headache, cortical blindness, seizure and altered mental status should prompt the diagnosis of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). Antithrombotic treatment, the alteration of endothelial function, and coagulopathy due to COVID-19 and PRES leading to the breakdown of blood-brain barrier may then contribute to the occurrence of a brain haemorrhage. METHODS: We describe the case of a COVID-19 patient who developed bilateral occipital lobe haemorrhages suggestive of haemorrhagic PRES. We then reviewed the available literature about haemorrhagic evolution of PRES in COVID-19. RESULTS: We describe the clinical and radiological features of five COVID-19 patients who developed haemorrhagic PRES. CONCLUSIONS: Coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction resulting from the massive release of cytokines during the host immune response may be key factors in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related PRES. Antithrombotic therapy and the leakage of the blood-brain barrier can subsequently increase the risk of haemorrhagic transformation of the lesioned brain tissue. A prompt diagnosis of PRES is mandatory, since the timely interruption/reversal of antithrombotic therapy may be a key determinant for a good prognosis.	Case Report
34203806	Infection Prevention Performance among In-Flight Cabin Crew in South Korea. COVID-19 was declared a worldwide pandemic in 2020; thus, preventing in-flight infection transmission is important for stopping global spread via air travel. Infection prevention (IP) performance among aircraft cabin crew is crucial for preventing in-flight transmission. We aimed to identify the level of IP performance and factors affecting IP performance among aircraft cabin crew during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. An online survey was conducted with 177 cabin crew members between August and September 2020. The survey assessed IP performance, and IP awareness, using a five-point Likert scale, and also evaluated simulation-based personal protective equipment (PPE) training experience, and organizational culture. The average IP performance score was 4.56 +/- 0.44. Although the performance level for mask-wearing was high (4.73 +/- 0.35), hand hygiene (HH) performance (4.47 +/- 0.56) was low. Multivariate analysis showed that IP performance was significantly associated with IP awareness (p < 0.05) and simulation-based PPE training experience (p < 0.05). Since HH performance was relatively low, cabin crew and airlines should make efforts to improve HH performance. Furthermore, a high level of IP awareness and PPE training experience can improve IP performance among cabin crew members. Therefore, simulation-based PPE training and strategies to improve IP awareness are essential for preventing in-flight infection transmission.	Prevention
34289910	Clinical characteristics and risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 inpatients in Birjand, Iran: a single-center retrospective study. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) has affected mortality worldwide. The Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model is becoming more popular in time-to-event data analysis. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics in COVID-19 inpatients including (survivor and non-survivor); thus helping clinicians give the right treatment and assess prognosis and guide the treatment. METHODS: This single-center study was conducted at Hospital for COVID-19 patients in Birjand. Inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Patients were classified as the discharged or survivor group and the death or non-survivor group based on their outcome (improvement or death). Clinical, epidemiological characteristics, as well as laboratory parameters, were extracted from electronic medical records. Independent sample T test and the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used to evaluate the association of interested variables. The CPH model was used for survival analysis in the COVID-19 death patients. Significant level was set as 0.05 in all analyses. RESULTS: The results showed that the mortality rate was about (17.4%). So that, 62(17%) patients had died due to COVID-19, and 298 (83.6%) patients had recovered and discharged. Clinical parameters and comorbidities such as oxygen saturation, lymphocyte and platelet counts, hemoglobin levels, C-reactive protein, and liver and kidney function, were statistically significant between both studied groups. The results of the CPH model showed that comorbidities, hypertension, lymphocyte counts, platelet count, and C-reactive protein level, may increase the risk of death due to the COVID-19 as risk factors in inpatients cases. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with, lower lymphocyte counts in hemogram, platelet count and serum albumin, and high C-reactive protein level, and also patients with comorbidities may have more risk for death. So, it should be given more attention to risk management in the progression of COVID-19 disease.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34282839	Prevention of COVID-19 by mRNA-based vaccines within the general population of California. BACKGROUND: Estimates of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness under real-world conditions, and understanding of barriers to uptake, are necessary to inform vaccine rollout. METHODS: We enrolled cases (testing positive) and controls (testing negative) from among the population whose SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic test results from 24 February-29 April 2021 were reported to the California Department of Public Health. Participants were matched on age, sex, and geographic region. We assessed participants' self-reported history of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine receipt (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273). Participants were considered fully vaccinated two weeks after second dose receipt. Among unvaccinated participants, we assessed willingness to receive vaccination. We measured vaccine effectiveness (VE) via the matched odds ratio of prior vaccination, comparing cases with controls. RESULTS: We enrolled 1023 eligible participants aged >/=18 years. Among 525 cases, 71 (13.5%) received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273; 20 (3.8%) were fully vaccinated with either product. Among 498 controls, 185 (37.1%) received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273; 86 (16.3%) were fully vaccinated with either product. Two weeks after second dose receipt, VE was 87.0% (95% confidence interval: 68.6-94.6%) and 86.2% (68.4-93.9%) for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively. Fully vaccinated participants receiving either product experienced 91.3% (79.3-96.3%) and 68.3% (27.9-85.7%) VE against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, respectively. Among unvaccinated participants, 42.4% (159/375) residing in rural regions and 23.8% (67/281) residing in urban regions reported hesitancy to receive COVID-19 vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Authorized mRNA-based vaccines are effective at reducing documented SARS-CoV-2 infections within the general population of California. Vaccine hesitancy presents a barrier to reaching coverage levels needed for herd immunity.	Treatment
34133069	Is home hemodialysis a practical option for older people? An increasing demand for in-center dialysis services has been largely driven by a rapid growth of the older population progressing to end-stage kidney disease. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to encourage home-based dialysis options have increased due to risks of infective transmission for patients receiving hemodialysis in center-based units. There are various practical and clinical advantages for patients receiving hemodialysis at home. However, the lack of caregiver support, cognitive and physical impairment, challenges of vascular access, and preparation and training for home hemodialysis (HHD) initiation may present as barriers to successful implementation of HHD in the older dialysis population. Assessment of an older patient's frailty status may help clinicians guide patients when making decisions about HHD. The development of an assisted HHD care delivery model and advancement of telehealth and technology in provision of HHD care may increase accessibility of HHD services for older patients. This review examines these factors and explores current unmet needs and barriers to increasing access, inclusion, and opportunities of HHD for the older dialysis population.	Prevention
34212322	Translating SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based epidemiology for prioritizing mass vaccination: a strategic overview. The inception of the novel coronavirus has forced the world into despair. Rapid progress has been made in addressing the situation, and various clinical diagnostic methods were developed for early detection of transmission. However, with a rapidly increasing number of infected populations worldwide, the testing of each individual was impractical. The wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been implemented to evaluate disease outbreaks as an early warning system for pandemic preparedness. Numerous studies reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the open drains and STPs across the globe via recovery efficiency of surrogate virus from existing virus concentration protocols. However, the such reported studies did not justify the use of WBE to identify or pinpoint the specific hotspots of transmission which could be prioritized for rapid efforts to contain or accelerate active vaccination efforts. Identifying precise locations of hotspots could be an essential aspect in controlling the outbreak and surge of wave by prioritizing the region for primary outbreak response. This article focuses on the issues relating to the primary focus for WBE that can be adapted, and its suitability for utilization in the mass vaccination program is discussed. Effective use of WBE information in terms of source tracking might be crucial as we move towards mass vaccination to control outbreaks of COVID-19 pandemic.	Prevention
34215642	Rare case of gastrointestinal mucormycosis with colonic perforation in an immunocompetent patient with COVID-19. Primary gastrointestinal mucormycosis is a rare disease associated with an increased mortality and is rarely reported in an immunocompetent host. We report the first case of mucormycosis-associated colonic perforation in a COVID-19 patient with a favourable outcome. A 48-year-old healthy male doctor in home isolation due to COVID-19 was admitted to COVID-19 intensive care unit when his symptoms deteriorated. The patient was put on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) using Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and treatment given as per existing hospital protocol. The patient improved clinically, and was discharged on day 10 of admission. Two days later, he presented with acute gastrointestinal symptoms to the emergency department. A diagnosis of perforation peritonitis was made, the patient was stabilised and sigmoid colectomy with descending colon colostomy was done. A diagnosis of gastrointestinal mucormycosis was made and injectable antifungal was started. The patient was discharged after his general conditions improved.	Case Report
34200122	Acute Myocardial Injury in a Patient with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and History of Substance Abuse: A Multimodality Imaging Point of View. Both cannabis and amphetamine are the most commonly used illegal substances worldwide and are associated with a number of adverse cardiovascular effects including transient coronary vasospasm. Here, we present the case of a 39-year-old male admitted to our institution with a 6-h history of severe chest pain and ST-segment elevation on the ECG. Coronary angiography on admission showed normal coronary arteries. The patient had a 14-year history of substance abuse, primarily amphetamine and cannabis, and was prescribed lisdexamfetamin (Aduvanz((R))) for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for the past 2 years. A cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) the following day showed widely distributed focal lesions of late gadolinium enhancement in mid- and sub-epicardial myocardium in the anterior, lateral and inferior walls, suggestive of chronic fibrotic lesions. There was no sign of acute myocardial edema. No viral cause was identified during a thorough investigation, including negative SARS-COV-2 and endomyocardial biopsy. Substance-abuse-induced coronary vasospasm leading to ST-segment elevation, myocardial damage with a rise and fall of cardiac TnT, as well as a slightly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (48%) and regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography, was the most likely diagnosis.

34132180	Recent Advances in the Discovery of Antiviral Metabolites from Fungi. As the world manages the impact of a global pandemic caused by COVID-19, the discovery of new antiviral agents has become way more relevant and urgent. Viruses are submicroscopic infectious agents that replicate inside the living cells of different organisms. These viruses use nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) for further replication and maturity inside the cells. Some of the viruses responsible for various human and plant diseases belong to the classes of Picornaviridae, Retroviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, Pneumoviridae, Virgaviridae, and Hepadnaviridae, and their treatment options are limited or non-existent. The consistent reemergence and resistance development in the viral strains demands the discovery and development of new antiviral drugs possessing better efficacy. Bio-active compounds isolated from fungi can be the source of new compounds with enhanced potency and new mechanisms of action. Fungi are known to produce a diverse lot of secondary metabolites due to their existence in harsh climates which are often inhabitable for many organisms. Due to these unique environments, fungi produce a variety of secondary metabolites of different chemical classes like alkaloids, quinones, furanone, pyrones, benzopyranoids, xanthones, terpenes, steroids, peptides, and many acyclic compounds. Fungal metabolites are known to display a wide range of bioactive attributes, i.e., anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-Alzheimer's, along with antiviral properties. In this review article, we report over 300 antiviral compounds from fungal sources during the period of 2009 to 2019. The source of these compounds is marine and endophytic fungi and they are arranged based on their antiviral action against different viral families. These compounds are promising in their use and development as future antiviral drugs.	Mechanism;Treatment
34213846	Insufficient type I IFN immunity underlies life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. We established the COVID Human Genetic Effort (www.covidhge.com) to discover the human genetic and immunological bases of the vast interindividual clinical variability between humans infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We found that about 3% of patients with life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia were ill because of inborn errors of genes controlling type I interferon (IFN)-dependent immunity (which controls influenza virus), and at least 10% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia had neutralizing auto-Abs against some of the 17 individual type I IFNs. These findings indicate that impaired type I IFN immunity underlies life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in at least 13% of patients. These discoveries pave the way for further research into unexplained severe cases, and provide a rationale for preventing and treating the disease in individuals at risk, with recombinant type I IFNs.

The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is characterized by the need of the search for curative drugs for treatment. In this paper, we present an update of knowledge about the interest of the functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMAs) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Forty-nine FIASMAs have been suggested in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection using in silico, in vitro or in vivo studies. Further studies using large-sized, randomized and double-blinded controlled clinical trials are needed to evaluate FIASMAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection as off-label therapy.	Mechanism;Treatment
34226862	The initial impact of COVID-19 on Australasian Sonographers Part 1: Changes in scan numbers and sonographer work hours. Introduction: COVID-19 has seen a series of lockdowns and suspension on non-urgent elective surgeries. Subsequently, there was a drop in the number of diagnostic imaging services billed in April, May, 2020. A survey was undertaken from March to June 2020 to determine the initial impact of COVID-19 on Australasian Sonographers. This article, the first in a 3-part series presents and discusses the results of this survey pertaining to changes in the number of scans performed, and changes in the working hours of sonographers. The remaining two articles in this series address other initial COVID-19 impacts on Australasian Sonographers. Methods: An online survey was conducted containing questions regarding changes to work hours and examination numbers. Results: 444 participants answered the survey. Seventy eight percent of sonographers reported a decrease in the number of examinations being performed in their department A decrease in work hours was reported by 68% of sonographers with almost a quarter of these reporting that they had lost all their hours. A higher percentage of work hours changes were seenin private practices. Many reductions in work hours were reported to be voluntary. Conclusion: Scan numbers in ultrasound departments were affected by COVID-19, as were sonographers' work hours.	Prevention
34342536	Catching SARS-CoV-2 by Sequence Hybridization: a Comparative Analysis. Controlling and monitoring the still ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic regarding geographical distribution, evolution, and emergence of new mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is only possible due to continuous next-generation sequencing (NGS) and sharing sequence data worldwide. Efficient sequencing strategies enable the retrieval of increasing numbers of high-quality, full-length genomes and are, hence, indispensable. Two opposed enrichment methods, tiling multiplex PCR and sequence hybridization by bait capture, have been established for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and are both frequently used, depending on the quality of the patient sample and the question at hand. Here, we focused on the evaluation of the sequence hybridization method by studying five commercially available sequence capture bait panels with regard to sensitivity and capture efficiency. We discovered the SARS-CoV-2-specific panel of Twist Bioscience to be the most efficient panel, followed by two respiratory panels from Twist Bioscience and Illumina, respectively. Our results provide on the one hand a decision basis for the sequencing community including a computation for using the full capacity of the flow cell and on the other hand potential improvements for the manufacturers. IMPORTANCE Sequencing the genomes of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains is the only way to monitor the viral spread and evolution of the virus. Two different approaches, namely, tiling multiplex PCR and sequence hybridization by bait capture, are commonly used to fulfill this task. This study describes for the first time a combined approach of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and NGS to evaluate five commercially available sequence capture panels targeting SARS-CoV-2. In doing so, we were able to determine the most sensitive and efficient capture panel, distinguish the mode of action of the various bait panels, and compute the number of read pairs needed to recover a high-quality full-length genome. By calculating the minimum number of read pairs needed, we are providing optimized flow cell loading conditions for all sequencing laboratories worldwide that are striving for maximizing sequencing output and simultaneously minimizing time, costs, and sequencing resources.

34213771	COVID-19-related deaths among women of reproductive age in Brazil: The burden of postpartum. OBJECTIVE: To compare risk of death due to COVID-19 among pregnant, postpartum, and non-pregnant women of reproductive age in Brazil, using the severe acute respiratory syndrome surveillance system (SARS-SS). METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of the Brazilian official SARS-SS, with data retrieved up to August 17, 2020. Cases were stratified by pregnancy status, risk factors or co-morbidities, and outcome (death or recovery). Multiple logistic regression was employed to examine associations between independent variables and risk of death. RESULTS: A total of 24 805 cases were included, with 3129 deaths (12.6%), including 271 maternal deaths. Postpartum was associated with increased risk of death, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and mechanical ventilation. Co-morbidities with higher impact on case fatality rate among non-obstetric cases were cancer and neurological and kidney diseases. Among pregnant women, cancer, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and rheumatology diseases were associated with risk of death. In the postpartum subgroup, age over 35 years and diabetes mellitus were independently associated with higher chance of death. CONCLUSION: Postpartum was associated with worse outcomes among the obstetric population, despite lower risk of dying without accessing ICU care. Non-pregnant women with cancer, neurological diseases, and kidney diseases have a higher risk of death due to COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34204197	Leveraging National Nursing Home Huddles for Rapid COVID-19 Response. A disproportionate number of older adult residents of U.S. nursing homes have died during the COVID-19 pandemic. The novelty of the virus spurred frequently changing guidance as nursing facilities navigated response efforts. In May 2020, the 6-month COVID-19 Rapid Response Network for Nursing Homes (RRN) was launched to leverage the concept of huddles across U.S. nursing homes to reduce COVID-19-related morbidity, mortality, and transmission by identifying best practices to rapidly implement, fostering connections between nursing homes, and refocusing the national narrative on optimism for nursing home care response efforts. Daily 20-min huddles transitioned to twice weekly in the program's final two months. A total of 93 huddles featured 103 speakers with 1960 participants engaging in both live huddles and asynchronous learning. 90.33% of participants said they learned at least two new ideas by participating and 89.17% strongly agreed or agreed that participating improved their ability to lead change in their organization. Qualitative data echoed gratitude for a centralized source of information and best practices and the sense of positivity and community the RRN provided. Leveraging nursing home huddles at the national, regional, local, system, or facility level may serve as a guidepost for future pandemics or work where guidance is new or quickly evolving.	Prevention
34344666	Measuring oxygen access: lessons from health facility assessments in Lagos, Nigeria. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted global oxygen system deficiencies and revealed gaps in how we understand and measure 'oxygen access'. We present a case study on oxygen access from 58 health facilities in Lagos state, Nigeria. We found large differences in oxygen access between facilities (primary vs secondary, government vs private) and describe three key domains to consider when measuring oxygen access: availability, cost, use. Of 58 facilities surveyed, 8 (14%) of facilities had a functional pulse oximeter. Oximeters (N=27) were typically located in outpatient clinics (12/27, 44%), paediatric ward (6/27, 22%) or operating theatre (4/27, 15%). 34/58 (59%) facilities had a functional source of oxygen available on the day of inspection, of which 31 (91%) facilities had it available in a single ward area, typically the operating theatre or maternity ward. Oxygen services were free to patients at primary health centres, when available, but expensive in hospitals and private facilities, with the median cost for 2 days oxygen 13 000 (US$36) and 27 500 (US$77) Naira, respectively. We obtained limited data on the cost of oxygen services to facilities. Pulse oximetry use was low in secondary care facilities (32%, 21/65 patients had SpO2 documented) and negligible in private facilities (2%, 3/177) and primary health centres (<1%, 2/608). We were unable to determine the proportion of hypoxaemic patients who received oxygen therapy with available data. However, triangulation of existing data suggested that no facilities were equipped to meet minimum oxygen demands. We highlight the importance of a multifaceted approach to measuring oxygen access that assesses access at the point-of-care and ideally at the patient-level. We propose standard metrics to report oxygen access and describe how these can be integrated into routine health information systems and existing health facility assessment tools.	Prevention
34205975	Multifaced Roles of HDL in Sepsis and SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Renal Implications. High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are a class of blood particles, principally involved in mediating reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissue to liver. Omics approaches have identified crucial mediators in the HDL proteomic and lipidomic profile, which are involved in distinct pleiotropic functions. Besides their role as cholesterol transporter, HDLs display anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-thrombotic, and anti-infection properties. Experimental and clinical studies have unveiled significant changes in both HDL serum amount and composition that lead to dysregulated host immune response and endothelial dysfunction in the course of sepsis. Most SARS-Coronavirus-2-infected patients admitted to the intensive care unit showed common features of sepsis disease, such as the overwhelmed systemic inflammatory response and the alterations in serum lipid profile. Despite relevant advances, episodes of mild to moderate acute kidney injury (AKI), occurring during systemic inflammatory diseases, are associated with long-term complications, and high risk of mortality. The multi-faceted relationship of kidney dysfunction with dyslipidemia and inflammation encourages to deepen the clarification of the mechanisms connecting these elements. This review analyzes the multifaced roles of HDL in inflammatory diseases, the renal involvement in lipid metabolism, and the novel potential HDL-based therapies.	Mechanism;Treatment
34284101	"COVID-19 and the Future of Clinical Epidemiology. Clinical epidemiology, the ""basic science for clinical medicine""(1), has changed substantially over the last fifty years, moving its focus from clinician driven research and clinical settings to large cohorts and trials, NIH funding, and practice guidelines. The COVID-19 pandemic created major challenges for clinicians who needed to make urgent decisions about the management a new disease and for researchers who needed to understand the clinical syndrome and the questions of greatest importance to the pandemic response. Addressing these challenges reunited clinicians and researchers in collaborative efforts to inform decisions about disease risk, prevention, prognosis and treatment, at least in part because of the shared sense of the need to ration scarce resources, the rapid evolution of understanding of the clinical syndrome, the recognition of widespread uncertainty, and the emphasis on the common good over individual credit. Only time will tell whether the experience during COVID-19 will revive the original practice of clinical epidemiology as ""the application by a physician who provides direct patient care, of epidemiologic and biometric methods to the study of diagnostic and therapeutic process in order to effect an improvement in health.""(2)."

34206540	Deep Learning-Based Stroke Disease Prediction System Using Real-Time Bio Signals. The emergence of an aging society is inevitable due to the continued increases in life expectancy and decreases in birth rate. These social changes require new smart healthcare services for use in daily life, and COVID-19 has also led to a contactless trend necessitating more non-face-to-face health services. Due to the improvements that have been achieved in healthcare technologies, an increasing number of studies have attempted to predict and analyze certain diseases in advance. Research on stroke diseases is actively underway, particularly with the aging population. Stroke, which is fatal to the elderly, is a disease that requires continuous medical observation and monitoring, as its recurrence rate and mortality rate are very high. Most studies examining stroke disease to date have used MRI or CT images for simple classification. This clinical approach (imaging) is expensive and time-consuming while requiring bulky equipment. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using non-invasive measurable EEGs to compensate for these shortcomings. However, the prediction algorithms and processing procedures are both time-consuming because the raw data needs to be separated before the specific attributes can be obtained. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new methodology that allows for the immediate application of deep learning models on raw EEG data without using the frequency properties of EEG. This proposed deep learning-based stroke disease prediction model was developed and trained with data collected from real-time EEG sensors. We implemented and compared different deep-learning models (LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Bidirectional LSTM) that are specialized in time series data classification and prediction. The experimental results confirmed that the raw EEG data, when wielded by the CNN-bidirectional LSTM model, can predict stroke with 94.0% accuracy with low FPR (6.0%) and FNR (5.7%), thus showing high confidence in our system. These experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of non-invasive methods that can easily measure brain waves alone to predict and monitor stroke diseases in real time during daily life. These findings are expected to lead to significant improvements for early stroke detection with reduced cost and discomfort compared to other measuring techniques.	Prevention
34290897	Hip Fractures in the Elderly During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Latin-American Perspective With a Minimum 90-Day Follow-Up. Introduction: Hip fracture patients have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the sub acute effects of a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection and the outcomes in highly exposed developing countries are still unknown. Our objective is to describe the morbidity and mortality of elderly patients admitted for a hip fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile, with a minimum 90-day follow-up. Also, to elucidate predictors for mortality and to compare mortality results with the pre-pandemic era. Material and Methods: Multicentric retrospective review of patients admitted for a fragility hip fracture in 3 hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, and during the same time in 2019. All clinical information and images were recorded, and patients were followed for a minimum of 90-days. Morbidity and mortality were the primary outcomes. Uni/multivariable models were performed to elucidate predictors for mortality utilizing the Weibull's regression. Results: Three hundred ninety-one cases were included. From the 2020 cohort (162 patients), 24 (15%) had a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourteen patients (58%) tested positive after admission. The COVID-19(+) group had a higher risk of in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality (p < 0.001). They also had a prolonged hospital stay and presented with more complications and readmissions (p < 0.05). Only COVID-19(+) status and older age were independent predictors for mortality with a HR = 6.5 (p = < 0.001) and 1.09 (p = 0.001), respectively. The 2020 cohort had twice the risk of mortality with a HR = 2.04 (p = 0.002) compared to the 2019 cohort. However, comparing only the COVID-19 (-) patients, there was no difference in mortality risk, with a HR = 1.30 (p = 0.343). Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected healthcare systems and elderly patients. Conclusions: Hip fracture patients with a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 virus infection were associated with increased morbidity and mortality throughout the first 3 months. COVID-19 status and older age were significant predictors for mortality. Efforts should be directed into nosocomial infection reduction and prompt surgical management. Level of evidence: Level III.

34285261	Syncing sustainable urban mobility with public transit policy trends based on global data analysis. Unforeseeable developments will accompany progressive COVID-19 recovery globally. Similarly, science will inform changes amidst its own progress. Social isolation and distancing imposed by the pandemic are likely to result in changed habits, behavior, and thinking paradigms. Inevitably, this should affect the tremendous confusion inhibiting automated urban mobility's evolution. While mobility often seems magnanimously resistant to change, using international data, this analysis shows road traffic, the largest net contributor to global warming, is responsible for even greater damages. The core claim justifies replacing private cars (PCs) by existing and future public transit (PT) vehicles. In testing 17 major cities globally, 94% of the scenarios proved PT superior or equivalent to PCs for reducing travel time. As a result, a foreseeable, future scenario shows potential reduction in car traffic by approximately two-thirds compared with the current situation. In two arenas, proactive government can promote such sustainable urban mobility: (1) developing autonomous vehicles for PT only; (2) coordinating standardization for seamless urban mobility. These global decisions for improving our lives in the future are likely to be better received and understood subsequent to COVID-19, as the focus of our concerns changes from what preoccupied us under the circumstances prior to the pandemic.

BACKGROUND: The morbidity and long term pulmonary consequences of COVID-19 infection continue to unfold as we learn and follow survivors of this disease. We report radiological evolution and pulmonary function findings in those patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients referred to the post-acute COVID-19 pulmonary clinic after a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The study period was after the initial peak of the pandemic in New York City, from June to December 2020. RESULTS: 111 patients were included. The average interval time between COVID-19 pneumonia and initial clinic evaluation was 12 weeks. 48.2% of patients had moderate and 22.3% had severe infection. Dyspnea and cough was the most common respiratory symptoms post infection. Radiographic abnormalities improved in majority of patients with ground glass opacities been the common residual abnormal finding. Restrictive airway disease and decreased diffusion capacity were the most common findings in pulmonary function test. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests the needs for close and serial monitoring of functional and radiological abnormalities during the post COVID-19 period. Considering that many of the clinical-radiological and functional abnormalities are reversible, we suggest a ""wait and watch""approach to avoid unnecessary invasive work up."	Diagnosis;Treatment
34227078	Side effects after COVID-19 vaccinations among residents of Poland. OBJECTIVE: Side effects of vaccines are common, but people react differently to different vaccines. Manufacturers provide lists of the side effects of their products. Adverse reactions are proof of the effectiveness of vaccines and that the immune system is responding. In this study, we compare the side effects of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines. Our survey results show that the side effects of the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine are more common than after the first and second doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Most respondents in our survey reported at least one side-effect after the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccine, but these reactions were less common after the Pfizer preparation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A survey was distributed via the internet. It was conducted among people vaccinated with Pfizer or AstraZeneca. The respondents were asked about the side effects after the first and second doses of the vaccines, such as injection site pain, arm pain, muscle pain, headache, fever, chills, and fatigue. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 705 people. 196 of them had been vaccinated with Pfizer and 509 with AstraZeneca. Among those vaccinated with the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, 96.5% reported at least one post-vaccination reaction. 17.1% of respondents reported all the side effects listed in the survey. Among those vaccinated with the first Pfizer dose, vaccine reactions were reported by 93.9% of respondents; 2% of respondents experienced all the side effects mentioned in the survey. The second dose of the Pfizer vaccine caused post-vaccinal reactions in most of the subjects: 54.8% of respondents had more adverse reactions, and 15.8% had fewer adverse reactions than after the first dose of this vaccine; 29.4% experienced the same side effects after the first and second doses of the Pfizer vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Side effects as a result of vaccination are not rare and are proof that the immune system is responding. However, severe adverse reactions to vaccines can be dangerous, and they engender fear. Concerns about the side effects and complications of COVID-19 vaccines may eclipse opinions regarding their benefits. This study shows that the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine causes side effects more often than either dose of the Pfizer vaccine.	Treatment
34224110	Antibody Cocktail Exhibits Broad Neutralization Activity Against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 Variants. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has precipitated multiple variants resistant to therapeutic antibodies. In this study, 12 high-affinity antibodies were generated from convalescent donors in early outbreaks using immune antibody phage display libraries. Of them, two RBD-binding antibodies (F61 and H121) showed high-affinity neutralization against SARS-CoV-2, whereas three S2-target antibodies failed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Following structure analysis, F61 identified a linear epitope located in residues G446-S494, which overlapped with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding sites, while H121 recognized a conformational epitope located on the side face of RBD, outside from ACE2 binding domain. Hence the cocktail of the two antibodies achieved better performance of neutralization to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, these two antibodies also showed efficient neutralizing activities to the variants including B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, and reacted with mutations of N501Y, E484K, and L452R, indicated that it may also neutralize the recent India endemic strain B.1.617. The unchanged binding activity of F61 and H121 to RBD with multiple mutations revealed a broad neutralizing activity against variants, which mitigated the risk of viral escape. Our findings revealed the therapeutic basis of cocktail antibodies against constantly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and provided promising candidate antibodies to clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients infected with broad SARS-CoV-2 variants.

34200572	Identification of Lung and Blood Microbiota Implicated in COVID-19 Prognosis. The implications of the microbiome on Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prognosis has not been thoroughly studied. In this study we aimed to characterize the lung and blood microbiome and their implication on COVID-19 prognosis through analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples, lung biopsy samples, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples. In all three tissue types, we found panels of microbes differentially abundant between COVID-19 and normal samples correlated to immune dysregulation and upregulation of inflammatory pathways, including key cytokine pathways such as interleukin (IL)-2, 3, 5-10 and 23 signaling pathways and downregulation of anti-inflammatory pathways including IL-4 signaling. In the PBMC samples, six microbes were correlated with worse COVID-19 severity, and one microbe was correlated with improved COVID-19 severity. Collectively, our findings contribute to the understanding of the human microbiome and suggest interplay between our identified microbes and key inflammatory pathways which may be leveraged in the development of immune therapies for treating COVID-19 patients.

34133724	United States Medicolegal Progress and Innovation in Telemedicine in the Age of COVID-19: A Primer for Neurosurgeons. Telemedicine has received increased attention in recent years as a potential solution to expand clinical capability and patient access to care in many fields, including neurosurgery. Although patient and physician attitudes are rapidly shifting toward greater telemedicine use in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains uncertainty about telemedicine's regulatory future. Despite growing evidence of telemedicine's utility, there remain a number of significant medicolegal barriers to its mass adoption and wider implementation. Herein, we examine recent progress in state and federal regulations in the United States governing telemedicine's implementation in quality of care, finance and billing, privacy and confidentiality, risk and liability, and geography and interstate licensure, with special attention to how these concern teleneurosurgical practice. We also review contemporary topics germane to the future of teleneurosurgery, including the continued expansion of reciprocity in interstate licensure, expanded coverage for homecare services for chronic conditions, expansion of Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimbursements, and protections of store-and-forward technologies. Additionally, we discuss recent successes in teleneurosurgery, stroke care, and rehabilitation as models for teleneurosurgical best practices. As telemedicine technology continues to mature and its expanse grows, neurosurgeons' familiarity with its benefits, limitations, and controversies will best allow for its successful adoption in our field to maximize patient care and outcomes.

This umbrella review of reviews examined the evidence on the work and health impacts of working in an epidemic/pandemic environment, factors associated with these impacts, and risk mitigation or intervention strategies that address these factors. We examined review articles published in MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase between 2000 and 2020. Data extracted from the included reviews were analyzed using a narrative synthesis. The search yielded 1524 unique citations, of which 31 were included. Included studies were focused on health care workers and the risk of infection to COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses, mental health outcomes, and health care workers' willingness to respond during a public health event. Reviews identified a variety of individual, social, and organizational factors associated with these work and health outcomes as well as risk mitigation strategies that addressed study outcomes. Only a few reviews examined intervention strategies in the workplace such as physical distancing and quarantine, and none included long-term outcomes of exposure or work during an epidemic/pandemic. Findings suggest a number of critical research and evidence gaps, including the need for reviews on occupational groups potentially exposed to or impacted by the negative work and health effects of COVID-19 in addition to health care workers, the long-term consequences of transitioning to the post-COVID-19 economy on work and health, and research with an equity or social determinants of health lens.

34199430	Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2 in an Asymptomatic Pediatric Allergic Cohort. Disease-specific COVID-19 pediatric comorbidity has not been studied effectively to date. Atopy and food anaphylaxis disease states require improved characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. To provide the first such characterization, we assessed serum samples of a highly atopic, food anaphylactic, asymptomatic pediatric cohort from across the US during the height of the pandemic. From our biobank, 172 pediatric patient serum samples were characterized specific to atopic, food anaphylactic, and immunologic markers in the US at the beginning of the pandemic, from 1 February to 20 April 2020. Clinical and demographic data were further analyzed in addition to sample analysis for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG ELISA. SARS-CoV-2 antibody results were positive in six patients (4%). Nearly half of the pediatric patients had a history of asthma (49%). Total IgE, total IgG, and IgG1-3 were similar in those positive and negative to SARS-CoV-2. Median total IgG4 in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group was nearly three times (p-value = 0.02) that of the negative group. Atopy controller medications did not confer additional benefit. Our data suggest that food anaphylaxis and highly atopic children are not at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. This specific population appears either at equal or potentially less risk than the general population. Total and specific IgG4 may be a novel predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk specific to the allergic pediatric population.	Diagnosis
34222264	Axonal Regeneration by Glycosaminoglycan. Like other biomolecules including nucleic acid and protein, glycan plays pivotal roles in various cellular processes. For instance, it modulates protein folding and stability, organizes extracellular matrix and tissue elasticity, and regulates membrane trafficking. In addition, cell-surface glycans are often utilized as entry receptors for viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, its roles as ligands to specific surface receptors have not been well understood with a few exceptions such as selectins and siglecs. Recent reports have demonstrated that chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate, both of which are glycosaminoglycans, work as physiological ligands on their shared receptor, protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPsigma). These two glycans differentially determine the fates of neuronal axons after injury in our central nervous system. That is, heparan sulfate promotes axonal regeneration while chondroitin sulfate inhibits it, inducing dystrophic endbulbs at the axon tips. In our recent study, we demonstrated that the chondroitin sulfate (CS)-PTPsigma axis disrupted autophagy flux at the axon tips by dephosphorylating cortactin. In this minireview, we introduce how glycans work as physiological ligands and regulate their intracellular signaling, especially focusing on chondroitin sulfate.	Mechanism;Treatment
34220854	Chronic Immune Activation and CD4(+) T Cell Lymphopenia in Healthy African Individuals: Perspectives for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Efficacy. Chronic immune activation has been considered as the driving force for CD4(+) T cell depletion in people infected with HIV-1. Interestingly, the normal immune profile of adult HIV-negative individuals living in Africa also exhibit chronic immune activation, reminiscent of that observed in HIV-1 infected individuals. It is characterized by increased levels of soluble immune activation markers, such as the cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and cellular activation markers including HLA-DR, CD-38, CCR5, coupled with reduced naive and increased memory cells in CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets. In addition, it is accompanied by low CD4(+) T cell counts when compared to Europeans. There is also evidence that mononuclear cells from African infants secrete less innate cytokines than South and North Americans and Europeans in vitro. Chronic immune activation in Africans is linked to environmental factors such as parasitic infections and could be responsible for previously observed immune hypo-responsiveness to infections and vaccines. It is unclear whether the immunogenicity and effectiveness of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will also be reduced by similar mechanisms. A review of studies investigating this phenomenon is urgently required as they should inform the design and delivery for vaccines to be used in African populations.	Mechanism;Treatment
34206865	Multi-Subunit SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Design Using Evolutionarily Conserved T- and B- Cell Epitopes. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created a public health crisis worldwide. Although vaccines against the virus are efficiently being rolled out, they are proving to be ineffective against certain emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The high degree of sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses (HCoV) presents the opportunity for designing vaccines that may offer protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants, with cross-protection against other HCoVs. In this study, we performed bioinformatics analyses to identify T and B cell epitopes originating from spike, membrane, nucleocapsid, and envelope protein sequences found to be evolutionarily conserved among seven major HCoVs. Evolutionary conservation of these epitopes indicates that they may have critical roles in viral fitness and are, therefore, unlikely to mutate during viral replication thus making such epitopes attractive candidates for a vaccine. Our designed vaccine construct comprises of twelve T and six B cell epitopes that are conserved among HCoVs. The vaccine is predicted to be soluble in water, stable, have a relatively long half-life, and exhibit low allergenicity and toxicity. Our docking results showed that the vaccine forms stable complex with toll-like receptor 4, while the immune simulations predicted that the vaccine may elicit strong IgG, IgM, and cytotoxic T cell responses. Therefore, from multiple perspectives, our multi-subunit vaccine design shows the potential to elicit a strong immune-protective response against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants while carrying minimal risk for causing adverse effects.

34216731	The indirect impact of COVID-19 large-scale containment measures on the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in older people: a region-wide population-based study in Tuscany, Italy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the indirect effect of COVID-19 large-scale containment measures on the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in older people during the first epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Tuscany, Italy. METHODS: A population-based study was carried out on data from the Tuscany healthcare system. The outcome measures were: hospitalization rate for CAP, severity of CAP hospitalizations, and outpatient consumption of antibacterials for CAP in people aged 65 and older. Outcomes were compared between corresponding periods in 2020 (week 1 to 27) and previous years. RESULTS: Compared with the average of the corresponding periods in the previous 3 years, significant reductions in weekly hospitalization rates for CAP were observed from the week in which the national containment measures were imposed (week 10) until the end of the first COVID-19 wave in July (week 27). There was also a significant decrease in outpatient consumption in all antibacterial classes for CAP. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of large-scale COVID-19 containment measures likely reduced the incidence of CAP in older people during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Tuscany, Italy. Considering this indirect impact of pandemic containment measures on respiratory tract infections may improve the planning of health services during a pandemic in the future.	Prevention
34288285	Safety of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in multiple sclerosis (MS): Early experience from a tertiary MS center in Israel. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the COVID-19 vaccines are currently recommended for people with multiple sclerosis (MS), the fact that they were not specifically tested in people with MS raises uncertainty regarding their safety in this population. The purpose of this study was to report real-life safety data of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in a cohort of MS patients. METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed to 425 MS patients. Participants were asked general demographic and disease-related questions and specific questions regarding the safety profile of the COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Of the 425 MS patients, 262 completed the questionnaire. The median (range) participant age was 42 (22-79) years, 199 participants were women (75.9%), and 66 participants (25.2%) had associated comorbidities. A total of 198 participants (75.6%) were treated with disease-modifying therapies. In all, 239 participants (91.2% of the responders) had received the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. Of these, 182 (76.1%) were aged <55 years, and 57 (23.9%) were aged >55 years. Adverse events were reported by 136 participants (56.9%; 52.5% of those aged <55 years and 40.3% of those aged >55 years; p = 0.1517) and 36 participants (15.1%) reported new or worsening neurological symptoms following the vaccination, the most frequent being sensory disturbances (21 participants, 58.3%). Most symptoms occurred within the first 24 h after vaccination and resolved within 3 days. A total of 28 participants (77.8%) did not require any medication to treat their symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This survey indicates an overall favorable safety profile of the BNT162b2 vaccine in people with MS. These data should be confirmed in further prospective, large-scale studies.	Treatment
34206722	Airway-On-A-Chip: Designs and Applications for Lung Repair and Disease. The lungs are affected by illnesses including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and infections such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Physiologically relevant models for respiratory conditions will be essential for new drug development. The composition and structure of the lung extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a major role in the function of the lung tissue and cells. Lung-on-chip models have been developed to address some of the limitations of current two-dimensional in vitro models. In this review, we describe various ECM substitutes utilized for modeling the respiratory system. We explore the application of lung-on-chip models to the study of cigarette smoke and electronic cigarette vapor. We discuss the challenges and opportunities related to model characterization with an emphasis on in situ characterization methods, both established and emerging. We discuss how further advancements in the field, through the incorporation of interstitial cells and ECM, have the potential to provide an effective tool for interrogating lung biology and disease, especially the mechanisms that involve the interstitial elements.

34287052	Porcine Haemagglutinating Encephalomyelitis Virus Triggers Neural Autophagy Independent of ULK1. Uncoordinated 51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) is a well-characterized initiator of canonical autophagy under basal or pathological conditions. Porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a neurotropic betacoronavirus (beta-CoV), impairs ULK1 kinase but hijacks autophagy to facilitate viral proliferation. However, the machinery of PHEV-induced autophagy initiation upon ULK1 kinase deficiency remains unclear. Here, the time course of PHEV infection showed a significant accumulation of autophagosomes (APs) in nerve cells in vivo and in vitro. Utilizing the ULK1-knockout neuroblastoma cells, we have identified that ULK1 was not essential for productive AP formation induced by PHEV. In vitro phosphorylation studies discovered that mTORC1-regulated ULK1 activation stalls during PHEV infection, whereas the AP biogenesis was controlled by AMPK-driven BECN1 phosphorylation. A lack of BECN1 is sufficient to block LC3 lipidation and disrupt recruitment of the LC3-ATG14 complex. Moreover, BECN1 acts as a bona fide substrate for ULK1-independent neural autophagy, and ectopic expression of BECN1 somewhat enhances PHEV replication. These findings highlight a novel machinery of non-canonical autophagy independent of ULK1 that bypasses the conserved initiation circuit of AMPK-mTORC1-ULK1, providing new insights into the interplay between neurotropic beta-CoV and the host. IMPORTANCE The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic alongside the outbreaks of SARS and MERS pose betacoronavirus (beta-CoV) as a global public health challenge. Coronaviruses subvert, haijack, or utilize autophagy to promote proliferation, thus exploring the cross-talk between beta-CoV and autophagy of great significance in confronting future beta-CoV outbreaks. Porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a highly neurotropic beta-CoV and invades the central nervous system (CNS) in pigs, but understanding of the pathogenesis for PHEV-induced neurological dysfunction yet limited. Here, we discovered a novel regulatory principle of neural autophagy initiation during PHEV infection, where productive autophagosome (AP) biogenesis bypassing the multifaceted regulation of ULK1 kinase. The PHEV-triggered non-canonical autophagy underscores the complex interactions of virus-host, and will help in the development of therapeutic strategies targeting non-canonical autophagy to treat beta-CoV disease.

34214519	Abdominal wall blocks for emergency ileostomy operation in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia: a case report. The anesthesia method to be administered during emergency surgical procedures for COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pneumonia patients carries great importance for both patient and surgical team. Regional blocks are generally used to ensure postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery with general anesthesia. In this case, involving a patient receiving anticoagulant treatment due to COVID-19 pneumonia with planned emergency operation, the aim was to present the anesthesia management with rectus sheath and transversus abdominis plane block combination for the ileostomy operation. Due to the administered blocks, the patient was not given general anesthesia. Hence, transmission was reduced by minimizing aerosol formation in terms of protecting health personnel and worsening of the patient's pneumonia was prevented. The case is discussed in terms of regional anesthesia techniques offering a good alternative in appropriate cases for both employee and patient safety in the present day, when the whole world is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

34281612	Prehospital characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Helsinki - experience of the first wave of the pandemic. BACKGROUND: There is a lack of knowledge how patients with COVID-19 disease differ from patients with similar signs or symptoms (but who will have a diagnosis other than COVID-19) in the prehospital setting. The aim of this study was to compare the characteristics of these two patient groups met by the emergency medical services. METHODS: All prehospital patients after the World Health Organisation (WHO) pandemic declaration 11.3.2020 until 30.6.2020 were recruited for the study. The patients were screened using modified WHO criteria for suspected COVID-19. Data from the electronic prehospital patient reporting system were linked with hospital laboratory results to check the laboratory confirmation for COVID-19. For comparison, we divided the patients into two groups: screening- and laboratory-positive patients with a hospital diagnosis of COVID-19 and screening-positive but laboratory-negative patients who eventually received a different diagnosis in hospital. RESULTS: A total of 4157 prehospital patients fulfilled the criteria for suspected COVID-19 infection during the study period. Five-hundred-thirty-six (12.9%) of the suspected cases received a laboratory confirmation for COVID-19. The proportion of positive cases in relation to suspected ones peaked during the first 2 weeks after the declaration of the pandemic. In the comparison of laboratory-positive and laboratory-negative cases, there were clinically insignificant differences between the groups in age, tympanic temperature, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, on-scene time, urgency category of the call and mode of transportation. Foreign-language-speakers were overrepresented amongst the positive cases over native language speakers (26,6% vs. 7,4%, p < 0,001). The number of cases in which no signs or symptoms of COVID-19 disease were reported, but patients turned out to have a positive test result was 125 (0,3% of the whole EMS patient population and 11,9% of all verified COVID-19 patients encountered by the EMS). CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of suspected COVID-19 patients, the laboratory-positive and laboratory-negative patients were clinically indistinguishable from each other during the prehospital assessment. Foreign-language-speakers had a high likelihood of having Covid-19. The modified WHO criteria still form the basis of screening of suspected COVID-19 patients in the prehospital setting.	Diagnosis
34281045	Telemedicine as a Therapeutic Option in Sports Medicine: Results of a Nationwide Cross-Sectional Study among Physicians and Patients in Germany. BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the number of treatments in the field of sports medicine is increasing. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed everyday life. Many consultations had to be cancelled, postponed, or converted to a virtual format. Telemedicine in sports medicine could support physicians. This study analyzes the use and perception of telemedicine applications among physicians and patients in the field of sports medicine in Germany. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study was based on a survey of sports medicine physicians and patients in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: We analyzed the responses of 729 patients and 702 sports medicine physicians. Most believed that telemedicine is useful. Both physicians and patients rated their knowledge of telemedicine as unsatisfactory. The majority of respondents said they do not currently use telemedicine but would like to do so. Patients and physicians reported that their attitude had changed positively towards telemedicine and that their usage had increased due to COVID-19. The majority in both groups agreed on implementing virtual visits in stable disease conditions. Telemedicine was considered helpful for follow-up monitoring and prevention by both groups. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine in sports medicine has seen limited use but is highly accepted among physicians and patients alike. The absence of a structured framework is an obstacle to effective implementation. Training courses should be introduced to improve the limited knowledge regarding the use of telemedicine. More research in telemedicine in sports medicine is needed. This includes large-scale randomized controlled trials, economic analyses and explorations of user preferences.	Prevention
34344634	Staff to staff transmission as a driver of healthcare worker infections with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: High rates of healthcare worker (HCW) infections due to COVID-19 have been attributed to several factors, including inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE), exposure to a high density of patients with COVID-19, and poor building ventilation. We investigated an increase in the number of staff COVID-19 infections at our hospital to determine the factors contributing to infection and to implement the interventions required to prevent subsequent infections. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study of staff working at a tertiary referral hospital who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 25 January 2020 and 25 November 2020. The primary outcome was the source of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Of 45 staff who returned a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, 19 were determined to be acquired at our hospital. Fifteen (15/19; 79% [95% CI: 54-94%]) of these were identified through contact tracing and testing following exposures to other infected staff and were presumed to be staff-to-staff transmission, including an outbreak in 10 healthcare workers (HCWs) linked to a single ward that cared for COVID-19 patients. The staff tearoom was identified as the likely location for transmission, with subsequent reduction in HCW infections and resolution of the outbreak following implementation of enhanced control measures in tearoom facilities. No HCW contacts (0/204; 0% [95% CI: 0-2%]) developed COVID-19 infection following exposure to unrecognised patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Unrecognised infections among staff may be a significant driver of HCW infections in healthcare settings. Control measures should be implemented to prevent acquisition from other staff as well as patient-staff transmission.	Prevention;Transmission
34208484	Current State of Knowledge about Role of Pets in Zoonotic Transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Pets play a crucial role in the development of human feelings, social life, and care. However, in the era of the prevailing global pandemic of COVID-19 disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), many questions addressing the routes of the virus spread and transmission to humans are dramatically emerging. Although cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been found in pets including dogs, cats, and ferrets, to date there is no strong evidence for pet-to-human transmission or sustained pet-to-pet transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, an increasing number of studies reporting detection of SARS-CoV-2 in farmed minks raises suspicion of potential viral transmission from these animals to humans. Furthermore, due to the high susceptibility of cats, ferrets, minks and hamsters to COVID-19 infection under natural and/or experimental conditions, these animals have been extensively explored as animal models to study the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and transmission. In this review, we present the latest reports focusing on SARS-CoV-2 detection, isolation, and characterization in pets. Moreover, based on the current literature, we document studies aiming to broaden the knowledge about pathogenicity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the development of viral therapeutics, drugs and vaccines. Lastly, considering the high rate of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and replication, we also suggest routes of protection against the virus.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Transmission;Treatment;Prevention
34199029	Levels of Produced Antibodies after Vaccination with mRNA Vaccine; Effect of Previous Infection with SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to estimate the immunogenic effect of mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This study included 510 participants who received mRNA vaccine. The measurement of anti-COVID-19 antibodies was performed using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG quantitative assay (Abbott). Overall, mean titer of anti-Spike antibodies was 19,319.2 +/- 1787.5 AU/mL. Vaccination induced a robust immunogenic response in those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared with non-infected subjects. Additionally, individuals that were asymptomatic after vaccination produced lower levels of antibodies compared to feverish individuals. In conclusion, remarkably high levels of anti-Spike COVID-19 antibodies were observed after vaccination.	Treatment
34207305	Studying SARS-CoV-2 with Fluorescence Microscopy. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus deeply affected the world community. It gave a strong impetus to the development of not only approaches to diagnostics and therapy, but also fundamental research of the molecular biology of this virus. Fluorescence microscopy is a powerful technology enabling detailed investigation of virus-cell interactions in fixed and live samples with high specificity. While spatial resolution of conventional fluorescence microscopy is not sufficient to resolve all virus-related structures, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy can solve this problem. In this paper, we review the use of fluorescence microscopy to study SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. The prospects for the application of the recently developed advanced methods of fluorescence labeling and microscopy-which in our opinion can provide important information about the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2-are discussed.

34374635	Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the incidences of vaccine-preventable diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic in the eastern of China. BACKGROUND: In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many countries have implemented mitigating non-pharmaceutical interventions. We investigated the impact of these interventions and changes in public behavior on the incidences of selected vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the eastern of China. METHODS: From routine monitoring data collected in the capital of eastern China's Jiangsu Province, we extracted and analyzed the incidences of influenza; hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD); varicella; mumps; pertussis; and hepatitis B. We also investigated the changes in public behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic through telephone interviews and questionnaire surveys. RESULTS: Compared with the baseline (2017-2019), the incidences of all VPDs except influenza declined significantly in 2020 (HFMD decreased by 79.92%, varicella decreased by 7.71%, mumps decreased by 2.03%, pertussis decreased by 78.91%, and hepatitis B decreased by 0.31%). The reduction in reported cases in children (0-14 years) was greater than that in adults, and pertussis had the largest reduction (approximately 80%) in children. Influenza peaks in winter; in the three years before the COVID-19 pandemic, Influenza rates took an average of 10 weeks to recede to their lowest levels after the Spring Festival, while in 2020, this took only 1 week. A total of 366 outbreaks with 20,205 cases were reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the participants in the study, 94.2% of the interviewees avoided going to high-risk areas, 82.4% avoided going to crowded places, 92.9% wore masks when going out,88.4% washed their hands frequently, and 67.9% maintained social distance. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed significant reductions in the incidences of VPDs after the implementation of a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic.	Prevention
34355175	A review of the latest research on M(pro) targeting SARS-COV inhibitors. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is still spreading at an alarming rate and has caused huge loss of life and economic damage worldwide. Although more than one year has passed, effective treatments for COVID-19 and other pathogenic coronaviruses have not yet been developed. Therefore, the development of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors is an urgent priority. Given that the M(pro) sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 are 100% identical in the catalytic domain for protein cleavage, the viral main protease (M(pro)) is one of the most extensive drug targets in all the drug targets being investigated for SARS-CoV-2. To provide scientific researchers with timely anti-SARS-CoV drug development information for M(pro), we focus on the past and current drug design and development strategies for M(Pro) in this review. We believe that this review will provide meaningful guidance for the design and development of innovative drugs against COVID-19 and other pathogenic coronaviruses in the future.	Mechanism;Treatment
34225674	Reach, engagement and effectiveness of in-person and online lifestyle change programs to prevent diabetes. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has accelerated interest in and need for online delivery of healthcare. We examined the reach, engagement and effectiveness of online delivery of lifestyle change programs (LCP) modelled after the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in a multistate, real-world setting. METHODS: Longitudinal, non-randomized study comparing online and in-person LCP in a large multistate sample delivered over 1 year. Sample included at-risk adults (n = 26,743) referred to online (n = 9) and in-person (n = 11) CDC-recognized LCP from a multi-state registry (California, Florida and Colorado) between 2015 and 2018. The main outcome was effectiveness (proportion achieving > 5% weight loss) at one-year. Our secondary outcomes included reach (proportion enrolled among referred) and engagement (proportion >/= 9 sessions by week 26). We used logistic regression modelling to assess the association between participant- and setting -level characteristics with meaningful weight loss. RESULTS: Online LCP effectiveness was lower, with 23% of online participants achieving > 5% weight loss, compared with 35% of in-person participants (p < 0.001). More adults referred to online programs enrolled (56% vs 51%, p < 0.001), but fewer engaged at 6-months (attendance at >/=9 sessions 46% vs 66%, p < 0.001) compared to in-person participants. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to adults referred to in-person LCP, those referred to online LCP were more likely to enroll and less likely to engage. Online participants achieved modest meaningful weight loss. Online delivery of LCP is an attractive strategy to deliver and scale DPP, particularly with social distancing measures currently in place. However, it is unclear how to optimize delivery models for maximal impact given trade-offs in reach and effectiveness.	Prevention

34287905	Correlations Between Olfactory Psychophysical Scores and SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load in COVID-19 Patients. OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between the severity and duration of olfactory dysfunctions (OD), assessed with psychophysical tests, and the viral load on the rhino-pharyngeal swab determined with a direct method, in patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Patients underwent psychophysical olfactory assessment with Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center test and determination of the normalized viral load on nasopharyngeal swab within 10 days of the clinical onset of COVID-19. RESULTS: Sixty COVID-19 patients were included in this study. On psychophysical testing, 12 patients (20% of the cohort) presented with anosmia, 11 (18.3%) severe hyposmia, 13 (18.3%) moderate hyposmia, and 10 (16.7%) mild hyposmia with an overall prevalence of OD of 76.7%. The overall median olfactory score was 50 (interquartile range [IQR] 30-72.5) with no significant differences between clinical severity subgroups. The median normalized viral load detected in the series was 2.56E+06 viral copies/10(6) copies of human beta-2microglobulin mRNA present in the sample (IQR 3.17E+04-1.58E+07) without any significant correlations with COVID-19 severity. The correlation between viral load and olfactory scores at baseline (R(2) = 0.0007; P = .844) and 60-day follow-up (R(2) = 0.0077; P = .519) was weak and not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of OD does not seem to be useful in identifying subjects at risk for being super-spreaders or who is at risk of developing long-term OD. Similarly, the pathogenesis of OD is probably related to individual factors rather than to viral load and activity. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 2021.	Diagnosis
34226887	Drive-up INR testing and phone-based consultations service during COVID-19 pandemic in a pharmacist-lead anticoagulation clinic in Qatar: Monitoring, clinical, resource utilization, and patient- oriented outcomes. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in unprecedented pressure on healthcare systems and led to widespread utilization of telemedicine or telehealth services. Combined with teleclinics, using drive-up fingerstick International normalized ratio (INR) testing was recommended to decrease exposure risk of anticoagulation patients. Objective: To evaluate the impact of transitioning from clinic-based anticoagulation management services to drive-up and phone-based services during COVID-19 pandemic in Qatar. Methods: The study comprised of two components: a retrospective cohort study of all eligible patients who attended anticoagulation clinic over 1-year period (6 months before and 6 months after service transition) and a cross-sectional survey of eligible patients who agreed to provide data about their satisfaction with the new service. Monitoring parameters, clinical outcomes, and resource utilization related to warfarin therapy were compared before and after service transition. Patients' experience was explored through a structured survey. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between clinic-based and phone-based anticoagulation services in mean time and number of visits within therapeutic range (P = .67; P = .06 respectively); mean number of extreme subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic INR values (P = .32 and P = .34, respectively); incidence of thromboembolic complications and warfarin related hospitalization. There was one reported bleeding and one emergency visit (0.9%) in the phone-based group vs none in the clinic-based group. Frequency of INR testing and compliance to attending clinics appointments declined significantly (P = .002; P = .001, respectively). Overall, patients were highly satisfied with the new service. The majority of patients found it better (51.6%) or just as good as the traditional service (44.5%). Patients who preferred the new service were significantly younger than their counterparts (P = .005). Conclusion: The service of drive-up INR testing and phone-based consultations was shown to be comparable to traditional anticoagulation service, a finding that supports maintaining such services as part of the new normal after the pandemic is over.

34202324	"Vaccine Effects on Susceptibility and Symptomatology Can Change the Optimal Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccines: South Korea as an Example. The approved coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines reduce the risk of disease by 70-95%; however, their efficacy in preventing COVID-19 is unclear. Moreover, the limited vaccine supply raises questions on how they can be used effectively. To examine the optimal allocation of COVID-19 vaccines in South Korea, we constructed an age-structured mathematical model, calibrated using country-specific demographic and epidemiological data. The optimal control problem was formulated with the aim of finding time-dependent age-specific optimal vaccination strategies to minimize costs related to COVID-19 infections and vaccination, considering a limited vaccine supply and various vaccine effects on susceptibility and symptomatology. Our results suggest that ""susceptibility-reducing"" vaccines should be relatively evenly distributed among all age groups, resulting in more than 40% of eligible age groups being vaccinated. In contrast, ""symptom-reducing"" vaccines should be administered mainly to individuals aged 20-29 and >/=60 years. Thus, our study suggests that the vaccine profile should determine the optimal vaccination strategy. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding vaccine's effects on susceptibility and symptomatology for effective public health interventions."	Treatment
34224870	Prevalence of, and factors associated with, long-term COVID-19 sick leave in working-age patients followed in general practices in Germany. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of, and the factors associated with, long-term sick leave in working-age patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in general practices in Germany. METHODS: Patients aged 18-65 years diagnosed with COVID-19 in any of 1255 general practices in Germany between March 2020 and February 2021 were included in the study. Long-term sick leave was defined as sick leave of at least 4 weeks. The association between predefined independent variables and long-term sick leave was studied using an adjusted logistic regression model. RESULTS: This study included 30 950 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (51.7% women, mean (standard deviation) age 41.5 (+/-13.0) years). The prevalence of long-term sick leave was 5.8%. Female sex, older age, and several conditions (noninfective enteritis and colitis; reaction to severe stress, and adjustment disorders; atopic dermatitis; mononeuropathies; reflux diseases; diabetes mellitus; and hypertension) were positively and significantly associated with long-term sick leave. CONCLUSION: Long-term sick leave was relatively rare in COVID-19 patients followed in general practices in Germany. These results should be confirmed or invalidated in other settings and countries.

34210785	"CD8(+) T cells specific for conserved coronavirus epitopes correlate with milder disease in COVID-19 patients. A central feature of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is that some individuals become severely ill or die, whereas others have only a mild disease course or are asymptomatic. Here we report development of an improved multimeric alphabeta T cell staining reagent platform, with each maxi-ferritin ""spheromer"" displaying 12 peptide-MHC complexes. Spheromers stain specific T cells more efficiently than peptide-MHC tetramers and capture a broader portion of the sequence repertoire for a given peptide-MHC. Analyzing the response in unexposed individuals, we find that T cells recognizing peptides conserved amongst coronaviruses are more abundant and tend to have a ""memory"" phenotype, compared to those unique to SARS-CoV-2. Significantly, CD8(+) T cells with these conserved specificities are much more abundant in COVID-19 patients with mild disease versus those with a more severe illness, suggesting a protective role."

34284227	The impact of social distancing, contact tracing, and case isolation interventions to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic: A modeling study. INTRODUCTION: Most countries are dependent on nonpharmaceutical public health interventions such as social distancing, contact tracing, and case isolation to mitigate COVID-19 spread until medicines or vaccines widely available. Minimal research has been performed on the independent and combined impact of each of these interventions based on empirical case data. METHODS: We obtained data from all confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 7th to February 22nd 2020 in Zhejiang Province, China, to fit an age-stratified compartmental model using human contact information before and during the outbreak. The effectiveness of social distancing, contact tracing, and case isolation was studied and compared in simulation. We also simulated a two-phase reopening scenario to assess whether various strategies combining nonpharmaceutical interventions are likely to achieve population-level control of a second-wave epidemic. RESULTS: Our study sample included 1,218 symptomatic cases with COVID-19, of which 664 had no inter-province travel history. Results suggest that 36.5 % (95 % CI, 12.8-57.1) of contacts were quarantined, and approximately five days (95 % CI, 2.2-11.0) were needed to detect and isolate a case. As contact networks would increase after societal and economic reopening, avoiding a second wave without strengthening nonpharmaceutical interventions compared to the first wave it would be exceedingly difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous attention and further improvement of nonpharmaceutical interventions are needed in second-wave prevention. Specifically, contact tracing merits further attention.	Prevention
34222708	Implementation of documented and written informed consent for clinical trials of communicable diseases: Lessons learned, barriers, solutions, future directions identified during the conduct of a COVID-19 clinical trial. Background and objective: The communicable nature of many infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, creates challenges for implementing and obtaining regulatory-compliant written informed consent. The goal of this project was to identify and evaluate processes that address these barriers while maintaining clinical and research staff safety. Methods: We reviewed Federal Drug Administration (FDA), World Health Organization (WHO), and VA Office of Research and Development (ORD) guidance about informed consent during the COVID-19 pandemic, and identified and pilot-tested several mechanisms for obtaining regulatory-compliant consent during our COVID-19 therapeutics clinical trial. Results: Several processes were identified. These included a standard face-to-face consent with a plan for maintaining a paper copy of the signed consent form, a phone or video chat consent process that included taking a picture of the signed consent form or a screen shot of the signed document during a video chat, integration of the consent forms into software embedded within the electronic health record, and secure software programs with electronic signature. These processes are FDA-compliant but time-intensive, often requiring four or more hours of coordination between the clinical team, research staff, patients, and legally authorized representatives. Conclusions: Future studies could evaluate how to improve efficiency, and whether some elements of the consenting process, such as the requirement for documented written signed consent, rather than a witnessed oral consent, is an acceptable standard for research participants with communicable diseases.

34199912	The Cost-Effectiveness of Expanding Vaccination with a Cell-Based Influenza Vaccine to Low Risk Adults Aged 50 to 64 Years in the United Kingdom. BACKGROUND: In response to COVID-19, the UK National Health Service (NHS) extended influenza vaccination in 50- to 64-year-olds from at-risk only to all in this age group for the 2020/21 season. The objective of this research is to determine the cost-effectiveness of continuing to vaccinate all with a quadrivalent cell-based vaccine (QIVc) compared to returning to an at-risk only policy after the pandemic resolves. METHODS: A dynamic transmission model, calibrated to match infection data from the UK, was used to estimate the clinical and economic impact of vaccination across 10 influenza seasons. The base case effectiveness of QIVc was 63.9% and the list price was GBP 9.94. RESULTS: Vaccinating 50% of all 50- to 64-year-olds with QIVc reduced the average annual number of clinical infections (-682,000), hospitalizations (-5800) and deaths (-740) in the UK. The base case incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (ICER) of all compared to at-risk only was GBP6000 (NHS perspective). When the cost of lost productivity was considered, vaccinating all 50- to 64-year-olds with QIVc became cost-saving. CONCLUSION: Vaccinating all 50- to 64-year-olds with QIVc is likely to be cost-effective. The NHS should consider continuing this policy in future seasons.	Treatment
34200331	Nucleic Acid Testing of SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a large global outbreak. It is accordingly important to develop accurate and rapid diagnostic methods. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method including reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most widely used assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Along with the RT-PCR method, digital PCR has emerged as a powerful tool to quantify nucleic acid of the virus with high accuracy and sensitivity. Non-PCR based techniques such as reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) are considered to be rapid and simple nucleic acid detection methods and were reviewed in this paper. Non-conventional molecular diagnostic methods including next-generation sequencing (NGS), CRISPR-based assays and nanotechnology are improving the accuracy and sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnosis. In this review, we also focus on standardization of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing and the activity of the National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and highlight resources such as reference materials (RM) that provide the values of specified properties. Finally, we summarize the useful resources for convenient COVID-19 molecular diagnostics.	Diagnosis
34375647	SARS-CoV-2 testing disparities across geographical regions from a large metropolitan area in Brazil: Results from a web-based survey among individuals interested in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines. After more than a year since the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 or COVID-19 has reached the status of a global pandemic, the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in Brazil. As no effective treatment been approved yet, only mass vaccination can stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and end the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple COVID-19 vaccine candidates are under development and some are currently in use. This study aims to describe the characteristics of individuals who have registered in an online platform to participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, participants' characteristics according to age and presence of comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and differences of SARS-CoV-2 testing across different geographical areas/neighborhoods are provided. This was a cross-sectional web-based study conducted between September and December/2020, aiming to reach individuals aged >/=18 years who live in Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, Brazil. Among 21,210 individuals who completed the survey, 20,587(97.1%) were willing to participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines. Among those willing to participate, 57.8% individuals were aged 18-59 years and had no comorbidity, 33.7% were aged 18-59 years and had at least one comorbidity, and 8.6% were aged >/=60 years regardless the presence of any comorbidity. Almost half (42.6%) reported ever testing for COVID-19, and this proportion was lower among those aged >/=60 years (p < 0.001). Prevalence of positive PCR results was 16.0%, higher among those aged 18-59 years(p < 0.009). Prevalence of positive antibody result was 10.0%, with no difference across age and comorbidity groups. Participants from areas/neighborhoods with higher Human Development Index (HDI) reported ever testing for SARS-CoV-2 more frequently than those from lower HDI areas. Interest to participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines candidates in Rio de Janeiro was significantly high. The online registry successfully reached out a large number of individuals with diverse sociodemographic, economic and clinical backgrounds.	Treatment;Diagnosis
34199158	Revisiting the Effects of High-Speed Railway Transfers in the Early COVID-19 Cross-Province Transmission in Mainland China. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic that was reported at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and was rapidly disseminated to all provinces in around one month. The study aims to assess the changes in intercity railway passenger transport on the early spatial transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China. Examining the role of railway transport properties in disease transmission could help quantify the spatial spillover effects of large-scale travel restriction interventions. This study used daily high-speed railway schedule data to compare the differences in city-level network properties (destination arrival and transfer service) before and after the Wuhan city lockdown in the early stages of the spatial transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China. Bayesian multivariate regression was used to examine the association between structural changes in the railway origin-destination network and the incidence of COVID-19 cases. Our results show that the provinces with rising transfer activities after the Wuhan city lockdown had more confirmed COVID-19 cases, but changes in destination arrival did not have significant effects. The regions with increasing transfer activities were located in provinces neighboring Hubei in the widthwise and longitudinal directions. These results indicate that transfer activities enhance interpersonal transmission probability and could be a crucial risk factor for increasing epidemic severity after the Wuhan city lockdown. The destinations of railway passengers might not be affected by the Wuhan city lockdown, but their itinerary routes could be changed due to the replacement of an important transfer hub (Wuhan city) in the Chinese railway transportation network. As a result, transfer services in the high-speed rail network could explain why the provinces surrounded by Hubei had a higher number of confirmed COVID-19 cases than other provinces.

34219674	Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) through infant feeding and early care practices: A systematic review. BACKGROUND: Perinatal practices such as breast-feeding, kangaroo mother care, rooming-in, and delayed cord clamping have varied by institution during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the success of different practices in preventing viral transmission between SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and their infants. METHODS: Electronic searches were performed in the Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Library, EBSCOhost CINAHL Plus, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Studies involving pregnant or breastfeeding patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR were included. Infants tested within 48 hours of birth who had two tests before hospital discharge were included. Infants older than one week with a single test were also included. RESULTS: Twenty eight studies were included. In the aggregated data, among 190 breastfeeding infants, 22 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (11.5%), while 4 of 152 (2.63%) among bottle-fed (Fisher's exact test p = 0.0006). The positivity rates for roomed in infants (20/103, 19.4%) were significantly higher than those isolated (5/300, 1.67%) (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in positivity rate among infants who received kangaroo care (25%vs 9%, p = 0.2170), or delayed cord clamping (3.62%vs 0.9%, p = 0.1116). CONCLUSIONS: Lack of robust studies involving large patient population does not allow meaningful conclusions from this systematic review. Aggregated data showed increased positivity rates of SARS-CoV-2 among infants who were breast fed and roomed-in. There were no differences in SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates in infants received skin to skin care or delayed cord clamping.	Diagnosis;Prevention;Transmission
34287509	Peripheral neuropathy in COVID-19 is due to immune-mechanisms, pre-existing risk factors, anti-viral drugs, or bedding in the Intensive Care Unit. BACKGROUND: This mini-review aims to summarize and discuss previous and recent advances in the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2-associated peripheral neuropathies. METHODS: Literature review. RESULTS: Altogether, 105 articles about SARS-CoV-2-associated neuropathy describing 261 patients were retrieved. Peripheral neuropathy in patients with COVID-19 is frequent and predominantly due to immune mechanisms or neurotoxic side effects of drugs used to treat the symptoms of COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, due to the compression of peripheral nerves resulting from prolonged bedding in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and pre-existing risk factors such as diabetes. SARS-CoV-2 does not cause viral neuropathy. Neurotoxic drugs such as daptomycin, linezolid, lopinavir, ritonavir, hydro-chloroquine, cisatracurium, clindamycin, and glucocorticoids should be administered with caution and patients should be appropriately bedded in the ICU to prevent SARS-CoV-2-associated neuropathy. Patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) benefit from immunoglobulins, plasma exchange, and steroids. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropathies of peripheral nerves in patients with COVID-19 are frequent and mostly result from immune mechanisms or neurotoxic side effects of drugs used to treat the symptoms of COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, from the compression of peripheral nerves due to prolonged bedding on the ICU. SARS-CoV-2 does not cause infectious neuropathy.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Treatment
34360751	"Mechanics Insights of Alpha-Lipoic Acid against Cardiovascular Diseases during COVID-19 Infection. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019. Since then, COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide and was declared a global pandemic on 20 March 2020. Cardiovascular complications are rapidly emerging as a major peril in COVID-19 in addition to respiratory disease. The mechanisms underlying the excessive effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on patients with cardiovascular comorbidities remain only partly understood. SARS-CoV-2 infection is caused by binding of the viral surface spike (S) protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), followed by the activation of the S protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). ACE2 is expressed in the lung (mainly in type II alveolar cells), heart, blood vessels, small intestine, etc., and appears to be the predominant portal to the cellular entry of the virus. Based on current information, most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus have a good prognosis, while a few patients reach critical condition, especially the elderly and those with chronic underlying diseases. The ""cytokine storm"" observed in patients with severe COVID-19 contributes to the destruction of the endothelium, leading to ""acute respiratory distress syndrome"" (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and death. At the origin of the general proinflammatory state may be the SARS-CoV-2-mediated redox status in endothelial cells via the upregulation of ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptors pathway or the increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production. Furthermore, this vicious circle between oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation induces endothelial dysfunction, endothelial senescence, high risk of thrombosis and coagulopathy. The microvascular dysfunction and the formation of microthrombi in a way differentiate the SARS-CoV-2 infection from the other respiratory diseases and bring it closer to cardiovascular diseases like myocardial infarction and stroke. Due the role played by OS in the evolution of viral infection and in the development of COVID-19 complications, the use of antioxidants as adjuvant therapy seems appropriate in this new pathology. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) could be a promising candidate that, through its wide tissue distribution and versatile antioxidant properties, interferes with several signaling pathways. Thus, ALA improves endothelial function by restoring the endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and presents an anti-inflammatory effect dependent or independent of its antioxidant properties. By improving mitochondrial function, it can sustain the tissues' homeostasis in critical situation and by enhancing the reduced glutathione it could indirectly strengthen the immune system. This complex analysis could open a new therapeutic perspective for ALA in COVID-19 infection."	Mechanism;Treatment
34225791	Safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. BACKGROUND: Various modalities of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), based on different platforms and immunization procedures, have been successively approved for marketing worldwide. A comprehensive review for clinical trials assessing the safety of COVID-19 vaccines is urgently needed to make an accurate judgment for mass vaccination. MAIN TEXT: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the safety of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, Scopus, Web of Science, and MedRxiv. Included articles were limited to RCTs on COVID-19 vaccines. A total of 73,633 subjects from 14 articles were included to compare the risks of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) after vaccinating different COVID-19 vaccines. Pooled risk ratios (RR) of total AEFI for inactivated vaccine, viral-vectored vaccine, and mRNA vaccine were 1.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.61, P < 0.001], 1.65 (95% CI 1.31-2.07, P < 0.001), and 2.01 (95% CI 1.78-2.26, P < 0.001), respectively. No significant differences on local and systemic AEFI were found between the first dose and second dose. In addition, people aged </= 55 years were at significantly higher risk of AEFI than people aged >/= 56 years, with a pooled RR of 1.25 (95% CI 1.15-1.35, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The safety and tolerance of current COVID-19 vaccine candidates are acceptable for mass vaccination, with inactivated COVID-19 vaccines candidates having the lowest reported AEFI. Long-term surveillance of vaccine safety is required, especially among elderly people with underlying medical conditions.	Treatment
34293501	Penicillin Allergy Label Increases Risk of Worse Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) ranges from asymptomatic to severe. Several comorbidities are associated with worse clinical outcomes. Antibiotic use is common in COVID-19 and penicillin (PCN) allergy can affect antibiotic choice and may influence COVID-19 outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of PCN allergy label on COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: For this retrospective, cohort study, a Web-based tool for population cohort research, TriNetX, was used to identify adult COVID-19 patients with and without PCN allergy label. The two cohorts were matched using 1:1 propensity score matching for baseline demographics and conditions associated with risk for severe COVID-19. The 30-day risks for hospitalization, acute respiratory failure, intensive care unit requirement, mechanical ventilation requirement, and mortality were then compared between groups. Because bacterial infection can drive alternative antibiotic regimens, additional analyses focused on patients without bacterial infection. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, each cohort consisted of 13,183 patients. COVID-19 patients with PCN allergy had higher risks for hospitalization (risk ratio [RR] = 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-1.52) acute respiratory failure (RR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.19-1.31), intensive care unit requirement (RR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08-1.34), and mechanical ventilation (RR = 1.17; 95% CI 1.03-1.32) compared with patients without PCN allergy; however, there was no mortality difference (RR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.96-1.23). Although the bacterial infection risk was higher in PCN allergic COVID-19 patients, exclusion of patients with bacterial infections yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillin allergic patients have higher risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes and should be considered for risk mitigation strategies.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34361174	Recent Progress in Nanotechnology for COVID-19 Prevention, Diagnostics and Treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic is currently an unprecedented public health threat. The rapid spread of infections has led to calls for alternative approaches to combat the virus. Nanotechnology is taking root against SARS-CoV-2 through prevention, diagnostics and treatment of infections. In light of the escalating demand for managing the pandemic, a comprehensive review that highlights the role of nanomaterials in the response to the pandemic is highly desirable. This review article comprehensively discusses the use of nanotechnology for COVID-19 based on three main categories: prevention, diagnostics and treatment. We first highlight the use of various nanomaterials including metal nanoparticles, carbon-based nanoparticles and magnetic nanoparticles for COVID-19. We critically review the benefits of nanomaterials along with their applications in personal protective equipment, vaccine development, diagnostic device fabrication and therapeutic approaches. The remaining key challenges and future directions of nanomaterials for COVID-19 are briefly discussed. This review is very informative and helpful in providing guidance for developing nanomaterial-based products to fight against COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment;Prevention
34227132	Did rest breaks help with acute fatigue among nursing staff on 12-h shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic? A cross-sectional study. AIM: This study aimed to explore whether 30-min rest breaks were as effective at lowering acute fatigue among 12-h shift hospital nursing staff who cared for patients with COVID-19 as among those who did not. DESIGN: The study was cross-sectional in design. METHODS: Data from the SAFE-CARE study collected online between May and June 2020 were used. A subsample (N = 338) comprised of nursing staff who reported working 12-h shifts, and providing direct patient care in hospitals was used in this study. Data on socio-demographics, work and rest breaks, and subjective measures of fatigue, psychological distress, sleep and health were used. Hierarchical multiple linear regression followed by stratified analyses was conducted to explore the relationships between rest breaks and acute fatigue among nursing staff groups with and without COVID-19 patient care. RESULTS: The sample, on average, had high acute fatigue. Around 72% reported providing care to patients with COVID-19, and 71% reported taking rest breaks 'sometimes', 'often' or 'always'. In the group that cared for patients with COVID-19, there was no significant relationship between rest breaks and acute fatigue (p = .507). In the group that cared for patients hospitalized for other reasons, rest breaks were associated with lower acute fatigue (p = .010). CONCLUSION: Our findings showed both the importance and inadequacy of rest breaks in reducing acute fatigue. The process of within-work recovery is complex, and routine rest breaks should be facilitated by nursing management on hospital units during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPACT: Rest breaks may present an effective strategy in lowering fatigue. Although rest breaks were not associated with less fatigue among staff caring for patients with COVID-19, other co-workers experienced some fatigue recovery. For frontline nursing staff, routine rest breaks are encouraged, and a systematic evaluation pertaining the sufficiency of rest breaks during high work demands in future research is needed.

34215080	A one-step, one-pot CRISPR nucleic acid detection platform (CRISPR-top): Application for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The existing CRISPR-mediated diagnostic tests require a two-step procedure (DNA or RNA amplification followed by CRISPR-mediated sequence-specific detection) for nucleic acid detection, which increases complexity and the risk of sample cross-contamination. Here, we report a new CRISPR-mediated test, called CRISPR-top (CRISPR-mediated testing in one-pot), which integrates simultaneous target pre-amplification with CRISPR/cas12b-mediated detection into a one-pot reaction mixture, performed at a constant temperature. The novel CRISPR-top assay was applied to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). COVID-19 CRISPR-top targets the ORF1ab (opening reading frame 1a/b) and NP (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2, and operates at 59 degrees C for 40 min with minimal instrument. The COVID-19 CRISPR-top assay can return results within 60-min and is easily interpreted by visual fluorescence or lateral flow readouts. The analytical limit of detection (LoD) for COVID-19 CRISPR-top is 10 copies (for each detection target) per reaction with no cross-reactivity observed from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically collected non-COVID-19 samples, the assay's specificity was 100% (80/80 oropharynx swab samples). Among 52 COVID-19 positive clinical samples collected, the COVID-19 CRISPR-top assay yielded 38 (73.1%) positive results using fluorescence readout and 35 (67.3%) positive results with lateral-flow readout. These diagnostic results were similar to those obtained using RT-PCR (34 positive (65.4%)). These data indicate that COVID-19 CRISPR-top is a simple, rapid, accurate and highly sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 detection which can be used in the clinic, field laboratories and primary care facilities in resource-challenged settings.

34201722	Use of Ceftaroline in Hospitalized Patients with and without COVID-19: A Descriptive Cross-Sectional Study. A single-center cross-sectional study was conducted to describe the use of ceftaroline in a large teaching hospital in Northern Italy, during a period also including the first months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The primary objective was to describe the use of ceftaroline in terms of indications and characteristics of patients. A secondary objective was to describe the rate of favorable clinical response in patients with bloodstream infections (BSI) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-BSI) receiving ceftaroline. Overall, 200 patients were included in the study. Most of them had COVID-19 (83%, 165/200) and were hospitalized in medical wards (78%, 155/200). Included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were given empirical ceftaroline in the suspicion of bacterial co-infection or superinfection. Among patients with MRSA-BSI, ceftaroline was used as a first-line therapy and salvage therapy in 25% (3/12) and 75% (9/12) of cases, respectively, and as a monotherapy or in combination with daptomycin in 58% (7/12) and 42% (5/12) of patients, respectively. A favorable response was registered in 67% (8/12) of patients. Improving etiological diagnosis of bacterial infections is essential to optimize the use of ceftaroline in COVID-19 patients. The use of ceftaroline for MRSA-BSI, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-MRSA agents, showed promising rates of favorable response.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34212913	COVID-19 pandemic in an Italian obstetric department: sharing our experience. BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (or SARS-CoV 2) has significantly struck the healthcare system worldwide. Over the course of a few weeks, hospitals reorganized their internal structure entirely at any level of care, from the Emergency rooms to Departments, including all the medical specialties. METHODS: In order to cope with the contingent state of emergency, the Gynecology and Obstetrics Unit of the University Hospital in Udine introduced new protocols and guidance for the usual standard of care, ensuring a safe environment for both healthcare providers and patients. RESULTS: By a continuous update of scientific evidence, the department was able to increase capacity as well as maintain flexibility when a higher number of admissions was required. CONCLUSION: We aimed to share our experience, which provided a relevant lesson about what to expect and how to prepare a referral center for high-risk pregnancy in response to a pandemic such as COVID-19.

34292458	The presentations/physician ratio predicts door-to-physician time but not global length of stay in the emergency department: an Italian multicenter study during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To investigate the effects of the dramatic reduction in presentations to Italian Emergency Departments (EDs) on the main indicators of ED performance during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. From February to June 2020 we retrospectively measured the number of daily presentations normalized for the number of emergency physicians on duty (presentations/physician ratio), door-to-physician and door-to-final disposition (length-of-stay) times of seven EDs in the central area of Tuscany. Using the multivariate regression analysis we investigated the relationship between the aforesaid variables and patient-level (triage codes, age, admissions) or hospital-level factors (number of physician on duty, working surface area, academic vs. community hospital). We analyzed data from 105,271 patients. Over ten consecutive 14-day periods, the number of presentations dropped from 18,239 to 6132 (- 67%) and the proportion of patients visited in less than 60 min rose from 56 to 86%. The proportion of patients with a length-of-stay under 4 h decreased from 59 to 52%. The presentations/physician ratio was inversely related to the proportion of patients with a door-to-physician time under 60 min (slope - 2.91, 95% CI - 4.23 to - 1.59, R(2) = 0.39). The proportion of patients with high-priority codes but not the presentations/physician ratio, was inversely related to the proportion of patients with a length-of-stay under 4 h (slope - 0.40, 95% CI - 0.24 to - 0.27, R(2) = 0.36). The variability of door-to-physician time and global length-of-stay are predicted by different factors. For appropriate benchmarking among EDs, the use of performance indicators should consider specific, hospital-level and patient-level factors.	Prevention
34205440	Antimicrobial Use in COVID-19 Patients in the First Phase of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: A Scoping Review. This scoping review provides new evidence on the prevalence and patterns of global antimicrobial use in the treatment of COVID-19 patients; identifies the most commonly used antibiotics and clinical scenarios associated with antibiotic prescribing in the first phase of the pandemic; and explores the impact of documented antibiotic prescribing on treatment outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The review complies with PRISMA guidelines for Scoping Reviews and the protocol is registered with the Open Science Framework. In the first six months of the pandemic, there was a similar mean antibiotic prescribing rate between patients with severe or critical illness (75.4%) and patients with mild or moderate illness (75.1%). The proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics without clinical justification was 51.5% vs. 41.9% for patients with mild or moderate illness and those with severe or critical illness. Comparison of patients who were provided antibiotics with a clinical justification with those who were given antibiotics without clinical justification showed lower mortality rates (9.5% vs. 13.1%), higher discharge rates (80.9% vs. 69.3%), and shorter length of hospital stay (9.3 days vs. 12.2 days). In the first 6 months of the pandemic, antibiotics were prescribed for COVID-19 patients regardless of severity of illness. A large proportion of antibiotic prescribing for mild and moderate COVID-19 patients did not have clinical evidence of a bacterial co-infection. Antibiotics may not be beneficial to COVID-19 patients without clinical evidence of a bacterial co-infection.	Treatment
34204759	"Is the Right to Abortion at Risk in Times of COVID-19? The Italian State of Affairs within the European Context. The COVID-19 health emergency has thrown the health systems of most European countries into a deep crisis, forcing them to call off and postpone all interventions deemed not essential or life-saving in order to focus most resources on the treatment of COVID-19 patients. To facilitate women who are experiencing difficulties in terminating their pregnancies in Italy, the Ministry of Health has adapted to the regulations in force in most European countries and issued new guidelines that allow medical abortion up to 63 days, i.e., 9 weeks of gestational age, without mandatory hospitalization. This decision was met with some controversy, based on the assumption that the abortion pill could ""incentivize"" women to resort to abortion more easily. In fact, statistical data show that in countries that have been using medical abortion for some time, the number of abortions has not increased. The authors expect that even in Italy, as is the case in other European countries, the use of telemedicine is likely to gradually increase as a safe and valuable option in the third phase of the health emergency. The authors argue that there is a need to favor pharmacological abortion by setting up adequately equipped counseling centers, as is the case in other European countries, limiting hospitalization to only a few particularly complex cases."

34229144	Choquet fuzzy integral-based classifier ensemble technique for COVID-19 detection. The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in a global pandemic and led to more than a million deaths to date. COVID-19 early detection is essential for its mitigation by controlling its spread from infected patients in communities through quarantine. Although vaccination has started, it will take time to reach everyone, especially in developing nations, and computer scientists are striving to come up with competent methods using image analysis. In this work, a classifier ensemble technique is proposed, utilizing Choquet fuzzy integral, wherein convolutional neural network (CNN) based models are used as base classifiers. It classifies chest X-ray images from patients with common Pneumonia, confirmed COVID-19, and healthy lungs. Since there are few samples of COVID-19 cases for training on a standard CNN model from scratch, we use the transfer learning scheme to train the base classifiers, which are InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and VGG19. We utilize the pre-trained CNN models to extract features and classify the chest X-ray images using two dense layers and one softmax layer. After that, we combine the prediction scores of the data from individual models using Choquet fuzzy integral to get the final predicted labels, which is more accurate than the prediction by the individual models. To determine the fuzzy-membership values of each classifier for the application of Choquet fuzzy integral, we use the validation accuracy of each classifier. The proposed method is evaluated on chest X-ray images in publicly available repositories (IEEE and Kaggle datasets). It provides 99.00%, 99.00%, 99.00%, and 99.02% average recall, precision, F-score, and accuracy, respectively. We have also evaluated the performance of the proposed model on an inter-dataset experimental setup, where chest X-ray images from another dataset (CMSC-678-ML-Project GitHub dataset) are fed to our trained model and we have achieved 99.05% test accuracy on this dataset. The results are better than commonly used classifier ensemble methods as well as many state-of-the-art methods.	Diagnosis
34291813	Interventions for the treatment of persistent post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction. BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is an early and sensitive marker of COVID-19 infection. Although self-limiting in the majority of cases, when hyposmia or anosmia persists it can have a profound effect on quality of life. Little guidance exists on the treatment of post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction, however several strategies have been proposed from the evidence relating to the treatment of post-viral anosmia (such as medication or olfactory training). OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions that have been used, or proposed, to treat persisting olfactory dysfunction due to COVID-19 infection. A secondary objective is to keep the evidence up-to-date, using a living systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register; Cochrane ENT Register; CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished studies. The date of the search was 16 December 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials including participants who had symptoms of olfactory disturbance following COVID-19 infection. Only individuals who had symptoms for at least four weeks were included in this review. Studies compared any intervention with no treatment or placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Primary outcomes were the recovery of sense of smell, disease-related quality of life and serious adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were the change in sense of smell, general quality of life, prevalence of parosmia and other adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included one study with 18 participants, which compared the use of a 15-day course of oral steroids combined with nasal irrigation (consisting of an intranasal steroid/mucolytic/decongestant solution) with no intervention. Psychophysical testing was used to assess olfactory function at baseline, 20 and 40 days. Systemic corticosteroids plus intranasal steroid/mucolytic/decongestant compared to no intervention Recovery of sense of smell was assessed after 40 days (25 days after cessation of treatment) using the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) score. This tool has a range of 0 to 100, and a score of >/= 90 represents normal olfactory function. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of this intervention on recovery of the sense of smell at one to three months (5/9 participants in the intervention group scored >/= 90 compared to 0/9 in the control group; risk ratio (RR) 11.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 173.66; 1 study; 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Change in sense of smell was assessed using the CCCRC score at 40 days. This study reported an improvement in sense of smell in the intervention group from baseline (median improvement in CCCRC score 60, interquartile range (IQR) 40) compared to the control group (median improvement in CCCRC score 30, IQR 25) (1 study; 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events andother adverse events were not identified in any participants of this study; however, it is unclear how these outcomes were assessed and recorded (1 study; 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very limited evidence available on the efficacy and harms of treatments for persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID-19 infection. However, we have identified other ongoing trials in this area. As this is a living systematic review we will update the data regularly, as new results become available. For this (first) version of the living review we identified only one study with a small sample size, which assessed systemic steroids and nasal irrigation (intranasal steroid/mucolytic/decongestant). However, the evidence regarding the benefits and harms from this intervention to treat persistent post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction is very uncertain.	Treatment
34208391	The Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Patients with Obesity after Intensive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-A Case-Control Study. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 lockdown may have negatively impacted the treatment of obesity. This study aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19 lockdown in patients with obesity treated with intensive residential cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-OB). METHODS: This retrospective case-control study analyzed 129 patients with severe obesity who experienced COVID-19 lockdown in the 6 months after discharge from intensive residential CBT-OB, comparing their outcomes on weight loss, binge-eating episodes, and general health status with those in a sample of patients matched by gender, age, and body mass index given the same treatment before the COVID-19 outbreak as control. Patients were assessed at baseline and by phone interview 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Both groups had lost more than 9% of their baseline bodyweight and reported a significant decrease in binge-eating episodes and similar general health status at 6-month follow-up. However, control patients achieved a significantly greater weight loss than those who experienced lockdown, although half of lockdown patients reported persisting with CBT-OB procedures after their discharge. CONCLUSION: Patients with obesity treated with CBT-OB and exposed to COVID-19 lockdown, despite achieving lower weight loss than non-exposed patients, had a healthy weight loss at 6-month follow-up and comparable reduction in binge-eating behaviors.

34375715	A tetrameric ACE2 protein broadly neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 spike variants of concern with elevated potency. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was previously engineered into a high affinity tetravalent format (ACE2-Fc-TD) that is a potential decoy protein in SARS-CoV-2 infection.We report that this protein shows greatly enhanced binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern B.1.1.7 (alpha variant, originally isolated in the United Kingdom) and B.1.351 (beta variant, originally isolated in South Africa) with picomolar compared with nanomolar Kd values. In addition, ACE2-Fc-TD displays greater neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype viruses compared to a dimeric ACE2-Fc, with enhanced activity on variant B.1.351. This tetrameric decoy protein would be a valuable addition to SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic approaches, especially where vaccination cannot be used but also should there be any future coronavirus pandemics.

34364072	A case of secondary sclerosing cholangitis due to COVID-19. COVID-19 was first recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in December 2019 and declared a global pandemic in March 2020. Although COVID-19 primarily results in pulmonary symptoms, it is becoming apparent that it can lead to multisystemic manifestations. Liver damage with elevated AST and ALT is seen in patients with COVID-19. Although the etiology of liver damage is still debated, biliary damage is rarely seen. This case demonstrates a potential complication of COVID-19 in a previously healthy patient. The patient contracted COVID-19 in March 2020 and endured a complicated course including intubation, multiple readmissions, and chronic abdominal pain. He is now awaiting a liver transplant. Our case portrays biliary damage as an additional possible complication of COVID-19 and the importance of imaging in its diagnosis.	Case Report
34211984	Clinical Profile, Pharmacological Treatment, and Predictors of Death Among Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients With Acute Kidney Injury: A Population-Based Registry Analysis. Introduction: One of the worst clinical outcomes of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods: This manuscript presents results from a population-based registry study assessing treatment, comorbidities, and predictors of hospital death among COVID-19 patients with AKI from March 1st to May 31th, 2020. Death, oxygen delivery and ventilation, acute dialysis need, use of medications, and various clinical outcomes, in addition to the length of stay in the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU), were evaluated. Results: In Castile and Leon, the largest region of Spain, 10.87% of the patients admitted for COVID-19 (n = 7,307) developed AKI. These patients were known by having hypertension (57.93%), cardiovascular disease (48.99%), diabetes (26.7%) and chronic kidney disease (14.36%), and they used antibiotics (90.43%), antimalarials (60.45%), steroids (48.61%), antivirals (33.38%), anti-systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) drugs (9.45%), and tocilizumab (8.31%). Mortality among patients with AKI doubled that observed in patients without AKI (46.1 vs. 21.79%). Predictors of hospital death in COVID-19 patients with AKI were ventilation needs (OR = 5.9), treatment with steroids (OR = 1.7) or anti-SIRS (OR = 2.4), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurrence (OR = 2.8), and SIRS occurrence (OR = 2.5). Conclusions: Acute kidney injury is a frequent and serious complication among COVID-19 patients, with a very high mortality, that requires more attention by treating physicians, when prescribing medications, by looking for manifestations particular to the disease, such as SARS or SIRS.

34335326	Maintenance Electroconvulsive Therapy Is an Essential Medical Treatment for Patients With Catatonia: A COVID-19 Related Experience. Aim: Describe naturalistic clinical course over 14 weeks in a mixed adolescent and a young-adult patient group diagnosed with developmental delays and catatonia, when the frequency of maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (M-ECT) was reduced secondary to 2020 COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Methods: Participants were diagnosed with catatonia, and were receiving care in a specialized clinic. They (n = 9), F = 5, and M = 4, ranged in age from 16 to 21 years; ECT frequency was reduced at end of March 2020 due to institutional restrictions. Two parents/caregivers elected to discontinue ECT due to concern for COVID-19 transmission. Majority (n = 8) were developmentally delayed with some degree of intellectual disability (ID). Observable symptoms were rated on a three point scale during virtual visits. Results: All cases experienced clinically significant decline. Worsening of motor symptoms (agitation, aggression, slowness, repetitive self-injury, stereotypies, speech deficits) emerged within the first 3 weeks, persisted over the 14 week observation period and were more frequent than neurovegetative symptoms (appetite, incontinence, sleep). Four participants deteriorated requiring rehospitalization, and 2 among these 4 needed a gastrostomy feeding tube. Conclusion: Moderate and severe symptoms became apparent in all 9 cases during the observation period; medication adjustments were ineffective; resuming M-ECT at each participant's baseline schedule, usually by week 7, resulted in progressive improvement in some cases but the improvement was insufficient to prevent re-hospitalization in 4 cases. In summary, rapid deterioration was noted when M-ECT was acutely reduced in the setting of COVID-19 related restrictions.	Prevention
34223473	Cultural Responsiveness and Palliative Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, much has changed in the delivery of palliative care (PC). However, cultural responsiveness remains critical to our mission. It is essential to our aims of identifying individual goals of care and providing relief of suffering for our patients. Cultural responsiveness may also enhance trust and could be a mitigating factor in the staggering health care disparities unmasked during this pandemic. In this study, the authors outline the rationale for renewed focus on this issue, and offer some initial suggestions for how culturally responsive PC can be provided even in this extraordinary time.

34292867	Evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on the adoption of virtual care in general practice in 20 countries (inSIGHT): rationale and study protocol. BACKGROUND: In recent decades, virtual care has emerged as a promising option to support primary care delivery. However, despite the potential, adoption rates remained low. With the outbreak of COVID-19, it has suddenly been pushed to the forefront of care delivery. As we progress into the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need and opportunity to review the impact remote care had in primary care settings and reassess its potential future role. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the perspectives of General Practitioners (GPs) / Family Doctors on a.) use of virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic; b.) perceived impact on quality and safety of care; c.) essential factors for high-quality and sustainable use of virtual care in the future. METHODS: Online cross-sectional questionnaire of GPs, distributed across 20 countries. The survey was hosted in Qualtrics and distributed using email, social media, and the researchers' personal contact networks. General Practitioners were eligible for the survey if they were working mainly in primary care during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistical analysis will be performed for quantitative variables, and relationships between the use of virtual care and perceptions on impact on quality and safety of care, and participants' characteristics, may be explored. Qualitative data (free-text responses) will be analysed using framework analysis. RESULTS: Data collection took place from June to September 2020. As of this manuscript's submission, a total of 1,605 GP respondents participated in the questionnaire. Further data analysis is currently ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: The study will provide a comprehensive overview of the availability of virtual care technologies, perceived impact on quality and safety of care and essential factors for high-quality future use. In addition, a description of the underlying factors that influence this adoption and perceptions, in both individual GP/FD characteristics, and the context in which they work, will be provided. While the COVID-19 pandemic may prove the first great stress test of the capabilities, capacity, and robustness of digital systems currently in use, remote care will likely remain an increasingly common approach in the future. There is an imperative to identify the main lessons from this unexpected transformation and use them to inform policy decisions and health service design.

34132419	Evaluation of automated molecular tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pooled nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens. BACKGROUND: Pooling of samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing in low-prevalence settings has been used as an effective strategy to expand testing capacity and mitigate challenges with the shortage of supplies. We evaluated two automated molecular test systems for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in pooled specimens. METHODS: Pooled nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were tested by Qiagen QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel (QIAstat) or Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert), and the results were compared to that of standard RT-qPCR tests without pooling. RESULTS: In nasopharyngeal specimens, the sensitivity/specificity of the pool testing approach, with 5 and 10 specimens per pool, were 77%/100% (n = 105) and 74.1%/100% (n = 260) by QIAstat, and 97.1%/100% (n = 250) and 100%/99.5% (n = 200) by Xpert, respectively. Pool testing of saliva (10 specimens per pool; n = 150) by Xpert resulted in 87.5% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity compared to individual tests. Pool size of 5 or 10 specimens did not significantly affect the difference of RT-qPCR cycle threshold (CT ) from standard testing. RT-qPCR CT values obtained with pool testing by both QIAstat and Xpert were positively correlated with that of individual testing (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.85 to 0.99, p < 0.05). However, the CT values from Xpert were significantly stronger (p < 0.01, paired t test) than that of QIAstat in a subset of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens, with mean differences of -4.3 +/- 2.43 and -4.6 +/- 2 for individual and pooled tests, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Xpert SARS-CoV-2 can be utilized for pooled sample testing for COVID-19 screening in low-prevalence settings providing significant cost savings and improving throughput without affecting test quality.

34225003	Risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) from hospital admission and the impact of protection efforts on acute stroke treatment. BACKGROUND: It is unclear how interventions designed to restrict community and in-hospital exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus influenced stroke care for patients seeking acute treatment. Therefore, we aimed to determine how these COVID-19 interventions impacted acute stroke treatment times and to assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their stay in our medical center. METHODS: Retrospective, single center, two-phase study evaluating hospital and community trends from 12/2019 - 04/2020 compared to the previous year and pre/post (n = 156/93) intervention implementation. Phase I assessed stroke treatment times, delay to hospital arrival, and witnessed stroke volume. Phase II, a post-implementation telephone survey, assessed risk of developing symptoms or testing positive for COVID-19. RESULTS: Stroke volume declined by 29% (p < .05) from April to March compared to the previous year. However, no significant delays in seeking medical care (pre Mdn=112, post Mdn=95, p = .34) was observed. Witnessed stroke volume decreased 11% (p < .001) compared to the pre-implementation group, but no significant delay in IV alteplase (pre Mdn=22 mins; post Mdn=26 mins, p = .08) nor endovascular treatment (pre Mdn=60 mins; post Mdn=80 mins, p = .45) was observed. In Phase II, 63 patients participated, two tested (3%) COVID-19 positive during admission and four (6%) within two weeks of discharge. COVID-19 contraction risk during and after hospitalization remained similar to the general population (RR=1.75, 95%CI: 0.79-3.63). Overall results indicated a marked decrease in stroke volume, no significant delays to either seek or provide acute stroke care were evident, and COVID-19 contraction risk was low. CONCLUSIONS: Seeking acute stroke medical care outweighs the risk of COVID-19 exposure.	Prevention

34283537	[Endothelial dysfunction in COVID- 19 and cognitive impairment]. Endothelial dysfunction is an important mechanism underlying multiple organ and systems failure in COVID-19. The development of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 can disrupt organ perfusion and cause a procoagulant state, leading to both macro- and microvascular thrombotic events. Cognitive impairment is a common complication of COVID-19 that develop in acute and delayed periods and is not directly related to the severity of the underlying disease. Treatment of endothelial dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 should take into account the leading pathogenetic factors of its development and with the development of neurological, including cognitive, disorders should include neuroprotective drugs. One of these drugs is actovegin, which has been shown to be effective in improving endothelial function, microcirculation and cognition.	Treatment;Mechanism
34208912	Use of Lateral Flow Immunoassay to Characterize SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Specific Antibodies and Their Ability to React with the UK, SA and BR P.1 Variant RBDs. Identifying anti-spike antibodies that exhibit strong neutralizing activity against current dominant circulating variants, and antibodies that are escaped by these variants, has important implications in the development of therapeutic and diagnostic solutions and in improving understanding of the humoral response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We characterized seven anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies for binding activity, pairing capability, and neutralization activity to SARS-CoV-2 and three variant RBDs via lateral flow immunoassays. The results allowed us to group these antibodies into three distinct epitope bins. Our studies showed that two antibodies had broadly potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and these variant RBDs and that one antibody did not neutralize the South African (SA) and Brazilian P.1 (BR P.1) RBDs. The antibody escaped by the SA and BR P.1 RBDs retained binding activity to SA and BR P.1 RBDs but was unable to induce neutralization. We demonstrated that lateral flow immunoassay could be a rapid and effective tool for antibody characterization, including epitope classification and antibody neutralization kinetics. The potential contributions of the mutations (N501Y, E484K, and K417N/T) contained in these variants' RBDs to the antibody pairing capability, neutralization activity, and therapeutic antibody targeting strategy are discussed.

34224783	Mechanisms underlying genetic susceptibility to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a pediatric complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection that is characterized by multiorgan inflammation and frequently by cardiovascular dysfunction. It occurs predominantly in otherwise healthy children. We previously reported haploinsufficiency of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), a negative regulator of type I and II interferons, as a genetic risk factor for MIS-C. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify additional genetic mechanisms underlying susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-associated MIS-C. METHODS: In a single-center, prospective cohort study, whole exome sequencing was performed on patients with MIS-C. The impact of candidate variants was tested by using patients' PBMCs obtained at least 7 months after recovery. RESULTS: We enrolled 18 patients with MIS-C (median age = 8 years; interquartile range = 5-12.25 years), of whom 89% had no conditions other than obesity. In 2 boys with no significant infection history, we identified and validated hemizygous deleterious defects in XIAP, encoding X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, and CYBB, encoding cytochrome b-245, beta subunit. Including the previously reported SOCS1 haploinsufficiency, a genetic diagnosis was identified in 3 of 18 patients (17%). In contrast to patients with mild COVID-19, patients with defects in SOCS1, XIAP, or CYBB exhibit an inflammatory immune cell transcriptome with enrichment of differentially expressed genes in pathways downstream of IL-18, oncostatin M, and nuclear factor kappaB, even after recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Although inflammatory disorders are rare in the general population, our cohort of patients with MIS-C was enriched for monogenic susceptibility to inflammation. Our results support the use of next-generation sequencing in previously healthy children who develop MIS-C.	Mechanism;Treatment

34213713	Could urinary kidney injury molecule-1 be a good marker in subclinical acute kidney injury in mild to moderate COVID-19 infection? PURPOSE: To evaluate urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (uKIM-1), which is a proximal tubule injury biomarker in subclinical acute kidney injury (AKI) that may occur in COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The study included proteinuric (n = 30) and non-proteinuric (n = 30) patients diagnosed with mild/moderate COVID-19 infection between March and September 2020 and healthy individuals as a control group (n = 20). The uKIM-1, serum creatinine, cystatin C, spot urine protein, creatinine, and albumin levels of the patients were evaluated again after an average of 21 days. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) uKIM-1 level at the time of presentation was 246 (141-347) pg/mL in the proteinuric group, 83 (29-217) pg/mL in the non-proteinuric group, and 55 (21-123) pg/mL in the control group and significantly high in the proteinuric group than the others (p < 0.001). Creatinine and cystatin C were significantly higher in the proteinuric group than in the group without proteinuria, but none of the patients met the KDIGO-AKI criteria. uKIM-1 had a positive correlation with PCR, non-albumin proteinuria, creatinine, cystatin C, CRP, fibrinogen, LDH, and ferritin, and a negative correlation with eGFR and albumin (p < 0.05). In the multivariate regression analysis, non-albumin proteinuria (p = 0.048) and BUN (p = 0.034) were identified as independent factors predicting a high uKIM-1 level. After 21 +/- 4 days, proteinuria regressed to normal levels in 20 (67%) patients in the proteinuric group. In addition, the uKIM-1 level, albuminuria, non-albumin proteinuria, and CRP significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support that the kidney is one of the target organs of the COVID-19 and it may cause proximal tubule injury even in patients that do not present with AKI or critical/severe COVID-19 infection.

34363439	[How long must be an elective surgery delayed after SARS-COV-2 diagnosis? (Multiple-center regional research)]. OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal postponement period for elective surgery in patients with SARS-COV-2 infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multiple-center regional prospective cohort research included patients who underwent elective surgeries in November, 2020. We compared the outcomes in patients with preoperative COVID-19 and those without infection. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality rate. This parameter was stratified depending on period after COVID-19 diagnosis using logistic regression. RESULTS: Preoperative COVID-19 was diagnosed in 32 (4.6%) out of 682 patients. Thirty-day mortality rate in patients without infection was 1.5%. Preoperative coronavirus infection increased mortality rate (odds ratio 20%, 25%, 18.1% and 8.3% for surgery within 0-2, 3-4, 5-6 and 7-8 weeks after infection, respectively). Surgeries after 7-8 weeks ensured the same result as in patients without infection (odds ratio 1.5%). After 7-8-week postponement of elective surgery, patients with COVID-19 and active symptoms had higher mortality rate compared to those without or resolved symptoms (50 vs. 13 vs 6.5%, respectively). CONCLUSION: If possible, elective surgery should be delayed for at least 7-8 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. In patients with active symptoms in 7-8 weeks after diagnosis of infection, further postponement of surgery is recommended.	Diagnosis;Prevention

Alcohol sales and consumption have increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, but their downstream effects on alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) are unclear. We analyzed inter-hospital escalation-of-care referrals to our tertiary care inpatient liver unit across 18 months through December 2020. There was a significant rise in severe ALD with recent unhealthy drinking in our regional community during the pandemic.	Prevention
34217399	Widespread implementation of a low-cost telehealth service in the delivery of antenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic: an interrupted time-series analysis. BACKGROUND: Little evidence is available on the use of telehealth for antenatal care. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and implemented a new antenatal care schedule integrating telehealth across all models of pregnancy care. To inform this clinical initiative, we aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of telehealth in antenatal care. METHODS: We analysed routinely collected health data on all women giving birth at Monash Health, a large health service in Victoria (Australia), using an interrupted time-series design. We assessed the impact of telehealth integration into antenatal care from March 23, 2020, across low-risk and high-risk care models. Allowing a 1-month implementation period from March 23, 2020, we compared the first 3 months of telehealth integrated care delivered between April 20 and July 26, 2020, with conventional care delivered between Jan 1, 2018, and March 22, 2020. The primary outcomes were detection and outcomes of fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes. Secondary outcomes were stillbirth, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks' gestation). FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2018, and March 22, 2020, 20 031 women gave birth at Monash Health during the conventional care period and 2292 women gave birth during the telehealth integrated care period. Of 20 154 antenatal consultations provided in the integrated care period, 10 731 (53%) were delivered via telehealth. Overall, compared with the conventional care period, no significant differences were identified in the integrated care period with regard to the number of babies with fetal growth restriction (birthweight below the 3rd percentile; 2% in the integrated care period vs 2% in the conventional care period, p=0.72, for low-risk care models; 5% in the integrated care period vs 5% in the conventional care period, p=0.50 for high-risk care models), number of stillbirths (1% vs 1%, p=0.79; 2% vs 2%, p=0.70), or pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia (3% vs 3%, p=0.70; 9% vs 7%, p=0.15), or gestational diabetes (22% vs 22%, p=0.89; 30% vs 26%, p=0.06). Interrupted time-series analysis showed a significant reduction in preterm birth among women in high-risk models (-0.68% change in incidence per week [95% CI -1.37 to -0.002]; p=0.049), but no significant differences were identified in other outcome measures for low-risk or high-risk care models after telehealth integration compared with conventional care. INTERPRETATION: Telehealth integrated antenatal care enabled the reduction of in-person consultations by 50% without compromising pregnancy outcomes. This care model can help to minimise in-person interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic, but should also be considered in post-pandemic health-care models. FUNDING: None.	Prevention
34215520	A case of psoriasis successfully treated by extracorporeal photopheresis during COVID-19 pandemic. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by well-demarcated erythematous plaques with a silver scale. Although many new and emerging therapeutic agents are often sufficient to control the disease, there is still a need for alternative treatment options in challenging cases. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) has been applied to many T-cell-mediated diseases to restore immune homeostasis and treat psoriasis effectively. In this paper, we present a psoriasis patient who did not respond to methotrexate, narrowband ultraviolet B, or acitretin. Because of a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the patient had contraindications for cyclosporine, fumaric acid esters, and biologics but achieved remission with a total of 12 sessions of ECP in two and a half months. Although exacerbation was recorded after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease infection at the end of the first month, scores from the psoriasis area severity index (PASI) and dermatological life quality index (DLQI) were regressed significantly within two and a half months. ECP seems to provide an effective and rapid response for psoriasis and should be considered for psoriasis patients who fail to respond or have contraindications to existing treatments.	Case Report
34209380	Apneic Tracheostomy in COVID-19 Patients on Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation. COVID-19 creates an impressive burden for intensive care units in terms of need for advanced respiratory care, with a huge number of acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS) requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. In some cases, this proves to be insufficient, with a refractory respiratory failure calling for an extracorporeal approach (veno-venous ECMO). In this scenario, most of these patients need an early tracheostomy procedure to be carried out, which creates the risk of distribution of aerosol particles, possibly leading to personnel infection. The use of apneic tracheostomy has been proposed for COVID-19 patients, but in case of ECMO it may produce lung derecruitment, severe hypoxemia, and sudden worsening of respiratory mechanics. We developed an apneic tracheostomy technique and applied it in over 32 patients supported by veno-venous ECMO. We present data showing the safety and feasibility of this technique in terms of patient care and personnel protection. Gas exchange and pH did not show statistically significant changes after the tracheostomy, nor did respiratory mechanics data or the need for inspiratory pressure and FiO2. The use of apneic tracheostomy was a safe option for patient care during ECMO and reduced the possibility of virus spreading.	Treatment
34207902	KI and WU Polyomavirus in Respiratory Samples of SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a global pandemic. Our goal was to determine whether co-infections with respiratory polyomaviruses, such as Karolinska Institutet polyomavirus (KIPyV) and Washington University polyomavirus (WUPyV) occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Oropharyngeal swabs from 150 individuals, 112 symptomatic COVID-19 patients and 38 healthcare workers not infected by SARS-CoV-2, were collected from March 2020 through May 2020 and tested for KIPyV and WUPyV DNA presence. Of the 112 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 27 (24.1%) were co-infected with KIPyV, 5 (4.5%) were positive for WUPyV, and 3 (2.7%) were infected simultaneously by KIPyV and WUPyV. Neither KIPyV nor WUPyV DNA was detected in samples of healthcare workers. Significant correlations were found in patients co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and KIPyV (p < 0.05) and between SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold values and KIPyV, WUPyV and KIPyV and WUPyV concurrently detected (p < 0.05). These results suggest that KIPyV and WUPyV may behave as opportunistic respiratory pathogens. Additional investigations are needed to understand the epidemiology and the prevalence of respiratory polyomavirus in COVID-19 patients and whether KIPyV and WUPyV could potentially drive viral interference or influence disease outcomes by upregulating SARS-CoV-2 replicative potential.

34212350	First envenomation report of the Cnidarian Physalia physalis in Indonesia. Despite the high number of victims every year, Physalia physalis's envenomations in Indonesia are scientifically unsounded. This annual event occurred mainly in Java's southern beaches and the Eastern Bali Islands, which are the most tourist destinations. The lack of scientific reports can lead to unaware and uneducated beachgoers resulting in a high number of victims, which in turn may ruin the economic sectors. Thus, this study aimed to report P. physalis's envenomation and its treatments in the southern beaches of the Special Region of Yogyakarta Province. It was based on the 15 beach lifeguards' and the primary health care units' reports in 2019-2020. The envenomation cases varied among beaches and years, whereas the highest number of cases were reported in the most popular beach (Parangtritis beach). The partial beach closing due to the pandemic COVID-19 caused the number of cases in 2020 was slightly lower than that in 2019. The envenomations' general symptoms were oedema and local pain that were treated with 5% food vinegar and hot water, if available. The severe cases (dyspnoea, nausea, vomiting, and cephalgia) were only reported twice in 2019. They were hospitalised in primary health care units; however, many people still practise the traditional non-scientific treatments, particularly in a chaotic situation.	Prevention
34287089	Pandemic Use of Telehealth by Oncology at a Rural Academic Medical Center. Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an exponential increase in telehealth. In response to the pandemic, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health (D-HH) and its Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) closed non-essential in-person services on March 17, 2020 and began reopening on April 27, 2020. We examined outpatient telehealth utilization at D-HH and NCCC in the peri-pandemic period and compared utilization to the Academic Medical Center (AMC) overall and to other service lines. Methods: Weekly outpatient volumes, percentage telehealth, percentage video versus audio-only, and percentage of new patients were examined for D-HH, for the AMC, and for selected AMC-based service lines from January 1 to October 31, 2020. Results: Compared with the AMC overall and with five other primarily non-surgical specialties, oncology was lower in the (1) proportion of outpatient visits performed via telehealth (example week 7/12/20: oncology = 11%; AMC = 21%; mean of 5 other specialties = 38%) and (2) percentage of telehealth involving video versus audio-only (7/12/20: oncology = 19%; AMC = 58%; mean of 5 others = 60%). Oncology more closely resembled the surgical specialty of orthopedics (7/12/20: 2% telehealth; 10% of telehealth involved video). Oncology also demonstrated (1) a high proportion of outpatient visits involving procedures (oncology = 22%; orthopedics = 12%) and (2) no difference between telehealth and in-person visits in terms of the percentage involving new patients. Conclusions: During the peri-pandemic period, our oncology service demonstrated a lower than average incorporation of telehealth overall into their outpatient practice and a lower proportion of telehealth performed by video. Further understanding these results and the drivers behind them will be integral for redesigning outpatient oncology care with optimal integration of telehealth.	Prevention
34220430	COVID-19: Sleep, Circadian Rhythms and Immunity - Repurposing Drugs and Chronotherapeutics for SARS-CoV-2. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has affected nearly 28 million people in the United States and has caused more than five hundred thousand deaths as of February 21, 2021. As the novel coronavirus continues to take its toll in the United States and all across the globe, particularly among the elderly (>65 years), clinicians and translational researchers are taking a closer look at the nexus of sleep, circadian rhythms and immunity that may contribute toward a more severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2-induced multi-organ failure affects both central and peripheral organs, causing increased mortality in the elderly. However, whether differences in sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity between older and younger individuals contribute to the age-related differences in systemic dysregulation of target organs observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unknown. Current literature demonstrates the emerging role of sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity in the development of chronic pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections in human and mouse models. The exact mechanism underlying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other cardiopulmonary complications in elderly patients in combination with associated comorbidities remain unclear. Nevertheless, understanding the critical role of sleep, circadian clock dysfunction in target organs, and immune status of patients with SARS-CoV-2 may provide novel insights into possible therapies. Chronotherapy is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in sleep medicine. Accumulating evidence suggests that nearly half of all physiological functions follow a strict daily rhythm. However, healthcare professionals rarely take implementing timed-administration of drugs into consideration. In this review, we summarize recent findings directly relating to the contributing roles of sleep, circadian rhythms and immune response in modulating infectious disease processes, and integrate chronotherapy in the discussion of the potential drugs that can be repurposed to improve the treatment and management of COVID-19.

34213803	The Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay enables high ratio pooling saving reagents and improving turnaround time. BACKGROUND: The Hologic Aptima TMA SARS-CoV-2 assay was employed to test pooled nasopharyngeal (NP) samples to evaluate the performance of pooled sample testing and characterize variables influencing results. METHODS: Results on 1033 previously tested NP samples were retrieved to characterize the relative light units (RLU) of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples in the tested population. The pooling strategy of combining 10 SARS-CoV-2 samples into one pool (10/1) was used in this study. The results were compared with neat sample testing using the same Aptima TMA SARS-CoV-2 assay and also the CDC RT-PCR and the Cepheid SARS-CoV-2 assays. RESULTS: The Aptima assay compares favorably with both CDC RT-PCR and the Cepheid SARS-CoV-2 assays. Once samples are pooled 10 to 1 as in our experiments, the resulting signal strength of the assay suffers. A divide opens between pools assembled from strong-positive versus only weak-positive samples. Pools of the former can be reliably detected with positive percent agreement (PPA) of 95.2%, while pools of the latter are frequently misclassified as negative with PPA of 40%. When the weak-positive samples with kRLU value lower than 1012 constitute 3.4% of the total sample profile, the assay PPA approaches 93.4% suggesting that 10/1 pooled sample testing by the Aptima assay is an effective screening tool for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Performing pooled testing, one should monitor the weak positives with kRLU lower than 1012 or quantification cycle (Cq) value higher than 35 on an ongoing basis and adjust pooling approaches to avoid reporting false negatives.

34281598	Differing susceptibility of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice-parents of the murine BXD family, to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection. The ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is closely related to SARS-CoV, poses a grave threat to global health and has devastated societies worldwide. One puzzling aspect of COVID-19 is the impressive variation in disease manifestations among infected individuals, from a majority who are asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms to a smaller, largely age-dependent fraction who develop life-threatening conditions. Some of these differences are likely the consequence of host genetic factors. Systems genetics using diverse and replicable cohorts of isogenic mice represents a powerful way to dissect those host genetic differences that modulate microbial infections. Here we report that the two founders of the large BXD family of mice-C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, differ substantially in their susceptibility to a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, MA15. Following intranasal viral challenge, DBA/2J develops a more severe disease than C57BL/6J as evidenced by more pronounced and sustained weight loss. Disease was accompanied by high levels of pulmonary viral replication in both strains early after infection but substantially delayed viral clearance in DBA/2J. Our data reveal that the parents of the BXD family are segregated by clear phenotypic differences during MA15 infection and support the feasibility of using this family to systemically dissect the complex virus-host interactions that modulate disease progression and outcome of infection with SARS-CoV, and provisionally also with SARS-CoV-2.

34289816	A cross-sectional survey assessing the influence of theoretically informed behavioural factors on hand hygiene across seven countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: Human hygiene behaviours influence the transmission of infectious diseases. Changing maladaptive hygiene habits has the potential to improve public health. Parents and teachers can play an important role in disinfecting surface areas and in helping children develop healthful handwashing habits. The current study aims to inform a future intervention that will help parents and teachers take up this role using a theoretically and empirically informed behaviour change model called the Capabilities-Opportunities-Motivations-Behaviour (COM-B) model. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was designed to measure participants' capabilities, opportunities, and motivations to [1] increase their children's handwashing with soap and [2] increase their cleaning of surface areas. Additional items captured how often participants believed their children washed their hands. The final survey was administered early in the coronavirus pandemic (May and June 2020) to 3975 participants from Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Participants self-identified as mums, dads, or teachers of children 5 to 10 years old. ANOVAs analyses were used to compare participant capabilities, opportunities, and motivations across countries for handwashing and surface disinfecting. Multiple regressions analyses were conducted for each country to assess the predictive relationship between the COM-B components and children's handwashing. RESULTS: The ANOVA analyses revealed that India had the lowest levels of capability, opportunity, and motivation, for both hand hygiene and surface cleaning. The regression analyses revealed that for Australia, Indonesia, and South Africa, the capability component was the only significant predictor of children's handwashing. For India, capability and opportunity were significant. For the United Kingdom, capability and motivation were significant. Lastly, for Saudi Arabia all components were significant. CONCLUSIONS: The discussion explores how the Behaviour Change Wheel methodology could be used to guide further intervention development with community stakeholders in each country. Of the countries assessed, India offers the greatest room for improvement, and behaviour change techniques that influence people's capability and opportunities should be prioritised there.	Prevention
34211530	Severe COVID-19: understanding the role of immunity, endothelium, and coagulation in clinical practice. SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The immune system is a determinant factor in defense against viral infections. Thus, when it acts in a balanced and effective manner the disease is self-limited and benign. Nevertheless, in a significant proportion of the population, the immune response is exaggerated. When infected, patients with diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular disease are more likely to progress to severe forms. These diseases are related to chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Toll-like receptors are expressed on immune cells and play an important role in the physiopathology of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. When activated, they can induce release of inflammatory cytokines. Hypercoagulability, hyperinflammation, platelet hyperresponsiveness, and endothelial dysfunction occur in immune system hyperactivity caused by viral activity, thereby increasing the risk of arterial and venous thrombosis. We discuss the interactions between COVID-19, immunity, the endothelium, and coagulation, as well as why cardiometabolic diseases have a negative impact on COVID-19 prognosis.

34200043	Respiratory Failure in an Extremely Premature Neonate with COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a condition associated with SARS-CoV-2, typically results in mild infection in infants and children. However, children with risk factors such as chronic lung disease and immunosuppression have higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. We report a case of a 27-week-gestation extremely premature infant born to a mother with COVID-19 infection. The infant, initially treated for surfactant deficiency, developed worsening hypoxic respiratory failure on the fifth day of life requiring escalating ventilatory support, an elevated level of C-reactive protein, thrombocytopenia, and an elevated level of d-dimer. The infant was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from Day 1 to Day 42 of his life. The infant responded to a seven-day course of dexamethasone with a gradually decreasing oxygen requirement and could be extubated to non-invasive ventilation by the end of the fifth week after birth. The infant is currently on home oxygen by nasal cannula. Prolonged shedding of the virus may be a unique feature of the disease in premature infants. Extreme prematurity, immature lungs, and an immunocompromised status may predispose these infants to severe respiratory failure and a prolonged clinical course. Instituting appropriate COVID-19 protocols to prevent the spread of the disease in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is of utmost importance. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may have implications in the management of extremely premature infants in the NICU.	Case Report
34200288	Viruses Like Sugars: How to Assess Glycan Involvement in Viral Attachment. The first step of viral infection requires interaction with the host cell. Before finding the specific receptor that triggers entry, the majority of viruses interact with the glycocalyx. Identifying the carbohydrates that are specifically recognized by different viruses is important both for assessing the cellular tropism and for identifying new antiviral targets. Advances in the tools available for studying glycan-protein interactions have made it possible to identify them more rapidly; however, it is important to recognize the limitations of these methods in order to draw relevant conclusions. Here, we review different techniques: genetic screening, glycan arrays, enzymatic and pharmacological approaches, and surface plasmon resonance. We then detail the glycan interactions of enterovirus D68 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), highlighting the aspects that need further clarification.

34216818	Behavioral responses of pregnant women to the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in the network Era in China: online questionnaire study. PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to examine the behavioral responses of pregnant women during the early stage of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. METHODS: We recruited 1,099 women to complete an online questionnaire survey from February 10 to February 25, 2020. The subjects were divided into two groups (the pregnant women group and the control group). RESULTS: Concerns about infection: most of the participants watched the COVID-19 news at least once a day. Protective behaviors: the utilization rate of pregnant women (often using various measures) was higher than that of non-pregnant women. Exercise: 30.6% of the pregnant women continued to exercise at home, while in the control group, this percentage was 8.4%. Spouse relationship: 38.8% of the subjects' relationship improved, while only 2.3% thought the relationship was getting worse. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women had some unique behavioral responses different form that of non-pregnant women. It is important to understand the behavioral responses of pregnant women in this network Era.	Prevention
34289054	Comparison of Six SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Methods and Correlation with the Cycle Threshold Distribution in Clinical Specimens. BACKGROUND: The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples is of critical importance in the management of patients and monitoring transmission in the population. However, data on the analytical performance characteristics for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens between individual targets within the same platform, and among different analytical platforms are limited. METHODS: Here we evaluated the performance of six different sample-to-answer SARS-CoV-2 detection methods -Roche cobas 6800, Cepheid GeneXpert, Diasorin Simplexa, Luminex Aries EUA, Luminex Aries RUO, and bioMerieux BioFire in clinical specimens with a range of viral loads. RESULTS: The positive percent agreement (PPA) between the Roche cobas 6800 and GeneXpert was 100%, Diasorin 95%, Aries EUA 74%, Aries RUO 83%, and BioFire 97%. Notably, in samples with cycle threshold (Ct) values below 30 for the E gene on the Roche cobas 6800 platform, we found 100% positive percent agreement among all platforms. Given these results, we examined the distribution of over 10,000 Ct values of all positive specimens from individuals at our institution on the Roche cobas platform. Nearly 60% of specimens from asymptomatic individuals had a PCR Ct value >30 as measured using the cobas 6800 assay E gene. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate performance characteristics between different platforms by Ct value, and provide data regarding the distribution of viral RNA present in positive specimens.

34336436	Bell's Palsy After 24 Hours of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the fastest-spreading pandemic of the 21st century. Various vaccines have been made available via emergency use authorization. Currently, two mRNA vaccines are being offered internationally, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. In randomized trials of these vaccines, the incidence of Bell's palsy in the vaccinated group does not statistically exceed the placebo group. The FDA recommends increased surveillance for Bell's palsy as a potential side effect with the administration of the vaccines among larger populations globally. There have been a few case reports of Bell's palsy associated with mRNA vaccines. Type I interferons have been proposed as the potential mechanism linking mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to Bell's palsy. Here, we report the case of a 36-year-old previously healthy patient who developed symptoms of Bell's palsy along with left-arm numbness, tingling, and subjective weakness masquerading as a subacute stroke after receiving the second dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. CT and MRI of the brain were unremarkable. He was discharged home with a diagnosis of Bell's palsy and improved on follow-up. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may be considered a risk factor for Bell's palsy.

34368228	The Potential Role of Extracellular Vesicles in COVID-19 Treatment: Opportunity and Challenge. SARS-CoV-2 infection has become an urgent public health concern worldwide, severely affecting our society and economy due to the long incubation time and high prevalence. People spare no effort on the rapid development of vaccine and treatment all over the world. Amongst the numerous ways of tackling this pandemic, some approaches using extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging. In this review, we summarize current prevalence and pathogenesis of COVID-19, involving the combination of SARS-CoV-2 and virus receptor ACE2, endothelial dysfunction and micro thrombosis, together with cytokine storm. We also discuss the ongoing EVs-based strategies for the treatment of COVID-19, including mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-EVs, drug-EVs, vaccine-EVs, platelet-EVs, and others. This manuscript provides the foundation for the development of targeted drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 infections.	Mechanism;Treatment
34282626	The use of prone positioning in severe COVID-19 outside the intensive care unit. OBJECTIVES: It was aimed to demonstrate the applicability of the prone position with high-flow oxygen to COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure in the service in September when the number of cases and the need for intensive care were increased. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The prone position was applied for a minimum of 30-minute periods for at least four hours a day. The patients' oxygen saturation levels and respiration rates were monitored before and 30 minutes after prone positioning. RESULTS: Ten patients, nine males (9/1, M/F), were included in the study. Mean oxygen saturation at baseline was 75.8+/-12.14 (min: 50 %; max: 90 %) and all patients had high oxygen demand. The oxygen saturation of the patients differed significantly before and after (83.4+/-6.38 %; 90+/-5.31 %, p <0.001) prone positioning. Similarly, respiration rates differed significantly before and after (23.9+/-6; 21.4+/-4.97, p <0.001) prone positioning. Two patients died during treatment. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the promise of prone positioning performed in ward conditions for improving oxygenation in COVID-19. While the study contains a small group, it may provide guidance for the clinical management of COVID-19 patients to prevent the need for intensive care in the challenging course of therapy (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 15).

34205262	The Role of Th17 Response in COVID-19. COVID-19 is an acute infectious disease of the respiratory system caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2). Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections occurs through droplets and contaminated objects. A rapid and well-coordinated immune system response is the first line of defense in a viral infection. However, a disturbed and over-activated immune response may be counterproductive, causing damage to the body. Severely ill patients hospitalised with COVID-19 exhibit increased levels of many cytokines, including Interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Increasing evidence suggests that Th17 cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, not only by activating cytokine cascade but also by inducing Th2 responses, inhibiting Th1 differentiation and suppressing Treg cells. This review focuses on a Th17 pathway in the course of the immune response in COVID-19, and explores plausible targets for therapeutic intervention.	Mechanism;Treatment
34356384	The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Key Emphasis on Melatonin Safety and Therapeutic Efficacy. Viral infections constitute a tectonic convulsion in the normophysiology of the hosts. The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is not an exception, and therefore the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, like any other invading microbe, enacts a generalized immune response once the virus contacts the body. Melatonin is a systemic dealer that does not overlook any homeostasis disturbance, which consequently brings into play its cooperative triad, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-stimulant backbone, to stop the infective cycle of SARS-CoV-2 or any other endogenous or exogenous threat. In COVID-19, the corporal propagation of SARS-CoV-2 involves an exacerbated oxidative activity and therefore the overproduction of great amounts of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). The endorsement of melatonin as a possible protective agent against the current pandemic is indirectly supported by its widely demonstrated beneficial role in preclinical and clinical studies of other respiratory diseases. In addition, focusing the therapeutic action on strengthening the host protection responses in critical phases of the infective cycle makes it likely that multi-tasking melatonin will provide multi-protection, maintaining its efficacy against the virus variants that are already emerging and will emerge as long as SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate among us.

34287040	Characterisation of a novel ACE2-based therapeutic with enhanced rather than reduced activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants. The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 acts as the host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and the other members of the Coronaviridae family SARS-CoV-1 and HCoV-NL63. Here we report the biophysical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 spike variants D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 with affinities to the ACE2 receptor and infectivity capacity, revealing weaknesses in the developed neutralising antibody approaches. Furthermore, we report a pre-clinical characterisation package for a soluble receptor decoy engineered to be catalytically inactive and immunologically inert, with broad neutralisation capacity, that represents an attractive therapeutic alternative in light of the mutational landscape of COVID-19. This construct efficiently neutralised four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The decoy also displays antibody-like biophysical properties and manufacturability, strengthening its suitability as a first-line treatment option in prophylaxis or therapeutic regimens for COVID-19 and related viral infections. IMPORTANCE Mutational drift of SARS-CoV-2 risks rendering both therapeutics and vaccines less effective. Receptor decoy strategies utilising soluble human ACE2 may overcome the risk of viral mutational escape since mutations disrupting viral interaction with the ACE2 decoy will by necessity decrease virulence thereby preventing meaningful escape. The solution described here of a soluble ACE2 receptor decoy is significant for the following reasons: While previous ACE2-based therapeutics have been described, ours has novel features including (1) mutations within ACE2 to remove catalytical activity and systemic interference with the renin/angiotensin system; (2) abrogated FcgammaR engagement, reduced risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection and reduced risk of hyperinflammation, and (3) streamlined antibody-like purification process and scale-up manufacturability indicating that this receptor decoy could be produced quickly and easily at scale. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2-based therapeutics confer a broad-spectrum neutralisation potency for ACE2-tropic viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in contrast to therapeutic mAb.

34226537	Monocyte-driven atypical cytokine storm and aberrant neutrophil activation as key mediators of COVID-19 disease severity. Epidemiological and clinical reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 virulence hinges upon the triggering of an aberrant host immune response, more so than on direct virus-induced cellular damage. To elucidate the immunopathology underlying COVID-19 severity, we perform cytokine and multiplex immune profiling in COVID-19 patients. We show that hypercytokinemia in COVID-19 differs from the interferon-gamma-driven cytokine storm in macrophage activation syndrome, and is more pronounced in critical versus mild-moderate COVID-19. Systems modelling of cytokine levels paired with deep-immune profiling shows that classical monocytes drive this hyper-inflammatory phenotype and that a reduction in T-lymphocytes correlates with disease severity, with CD8+ cells being disproportionately affected. Antigen presenting machinery expression is also reduced in critical disease. Furthermore, we report that neutrophils contribute to disease severity and local tissue damage by amplification of hypercytokinemia and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Together our findings suggest a myeloid-driven immunopathology, in which hyperactivated neutrophils and an ineffective adaptive immune system act as mediators of COVID-19 disease severity.

34285653	Filtering Facepiece Respirators for Healthcare Workers Protection in the Time of COVID-19 Pandemic. Protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) who are in the frontline during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic is paramount. The filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) or N95 respirator is one of the personal protective equipment (PPE) used to protect HCWs exposed to airborne pathogens in clinical practice or when performing aerosol generating procedures. The FFRs should be able to serve the intended purpose without causing additional health and safety hazards for the HCWs. The following commentary will provide some basic information on selecting correct FFRs and conducting fitness test.	Prevention
34224523	Trends in nationally notifiable sexually transmitted disease case reports during the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic, January-December 2020. BACKGROUND: To describe changes in reported sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during the U.S. coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, we compared the weekly number of reported nationally notifiable STDs in 2020 to 2019. METHODS: We reviewed cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and primary & secondary (P&S) syphilis reported to the U.S. National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System in 2020. For each STD, we compare the number of 2020 cases reported for a given Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) week to the number of 2019 cases reported in the same week, expressing 2020 cases as a percentage of 2019 cases. We also calculated the percent difference between 2020 and 2019 cumulative case totals as of MMWR week 50 (week of December 9). RESULTS: During MMWR weeks 1-11 (week of December 29, 2019-March 11, 2020), the weekly number of cases of STDs reported in 2020 as a percentage of the cases in the same week in 2019 were similar. However, 2020 numbers were much lower than 2019 numbers in week 15 (week of April 8; chlamydia, 49.8%; gonorrhea, 71.2%; and P&S syphilis, 63.7%). As of week 50, the 2020 cumulative totals compared to 2019 were 14.0% lower for chlamydia, 7.1% higher for gonorrhea, and 0.9% lower for P&S syphilis. CONCLUSION: During March-April 2020, national case reporting for STDs dramatically decreased compared to 2019. However, resurgence in reported gonorrhea and syphilis cases later in the year suggest STD reporting may have increased during 2020, underscoring the importance of continued STD prevention and care activities.

34217421	The national FIT-based colorectal cancer screening program in the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many healthcare services worldwide. Like many other nations, the Netherlands experienced large numbers of individuals affected by COVID-19 in 2020, leading to increased demands on hospitals and intensive care units. The Dutch Ministry of Health decided to suspend the Dutch biennial fecal immunochemical test (FIT) based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening program from March 16, 2020. FIT invitations were resumed on June 3. In this study, we describe the short-term effects of this suspension on a myriad of relevant screening outcomes. As a result of the suspension, a quarter of the individuals due for screening between March and November 2020 had not received their invitation for FIT screening by November 30, 2020. Furthermore, 57.8% of those who received a consecutive FIT between the restart and November 30, 2020, received it outside the upper limit of the standard screening interval (26 months). Median time between positive FIT and colonoscopy did not change as a result of the pandemic. Participation rates of FIT screening and follow-up colonoscopy in the months just before and during the suspension were significantly lower than expected, but returned to normal levels after the suspension. Based on the anticipated 2020 cohort size, we estimate that the number of individuals with advanced neoplasia currently detected up until November 2020 was 31.2% lower compared to what would have been expected without a pandemic. Future studies should monitor the impact on long-term screening outcomes as a result of the pandemic.	Prevention
34281357	Myocarditis With COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines. Myocarditis has been recognized as a rare complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccinations, especially in young adult and adolescent males. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, myocarditis/pericarditis rates are approximately 12.6 cases per million doses of second-dose mRNA vaccine among individuals 12 to 39 years of age. In reported cases, patients with myocarditis invariably presented with chest pain, usually 2 to 3 days after a second dose of mRNA vaccination, and had elevated cardiac troponin levels. ECG was abnormal with ST elevations in most, and cardiac MRI was suggestive of myocarditis in all tested patients. There was no evidence of acute COVID-19 or other viral infections. In 1 case, a cardiomyopathy gene panel was negative, but autoantibody levels against certain self-antigens and frequency of natural killer cells were increased. Although the mechanisms for development of myocarditis are not clear, molecular mimicry between the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and self-antigens, trigger of preexisting dysregulated immune pathways in certain individuals, immune response to mRNA, and activation of immunologic pathways, and dysregulated cytokine expression have been proposed. The reasons for male predominance in myocarditis cases are unknown, but possible explanations relate to sex hormone differences in immune response and myocarditis, and also underdiagnosis of cardiac disease in women. Almost all patients had resolution of symptoms and signs and improvement in diagnostic markers and imaging with or without treatment. Despite rare cases of myocarditis, the benefit-risk assessment for COVID-19 vaccination shows a favorable balance for all age and sex groups; therefore, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone >/=12 years of age.

34220639	Risk-Aversion for Negative Health Outcomes May Promote Individual Compliance to Containment Measures in Covid-19 Pandemic. First-person experience of stressful life events can change individuals' risk attitudes, driving to increased or decreased risk perception. This shift to more risk-averse or risk-loving behaviors may find a correlate in the individual psycho-socio-emotional profile. To this purpose, we aimed to estimate the relationship between differences in risk-taking attitudes toward possible negative health outcomes and psycho-socio-emotional dimensions modulating the experience of life-threatening situations, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. In March 2020, we launched the PsyCovid Study (https://wprn.org/item/428452) to assess psycho-socio-emotional changes due to Covid-19 pandemic in the Italian population. Additionally, we distributed to 130 participants the Covid-19 Risk Task, including monetary and health-related stimuli, estimating a measure of risk-aversion toward health and classifying participants on the basis of their risk-attitude profiles. The set of psycho-socio-emotional variables was reduced to three PCA components: Proactivity, Isolation, Inactivity. The individual degree of risk-aversion toward negative health outcomes was directly related to Proactivity, encasing empathic, social support and positive coping strategies, which may prompt individuals to put in place self-protection strategies toward possible negative health consequences. These findings indicate that a risk-averse profile toward possible negative health outcomes may be associated to higher levels of individual prosocial and proactive dispositions, possibly making individuals' more compliant with the social and hygienic guidelines and, thus, reducing their exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

34198562	Impacts of Side Effects to BNT162b2 and the First Dose of ChAdOx1 Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination on Work Productivity, the Need for Medical Attention, and Vaccine Acceptance: A Multicenter Survey on Healthcare Workers in Referral Teaching Hospitals in the Republic of Korea. To establish a successful anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategy, it is necessary to take possible tradeoffs into account. We conducted a survey on vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs) inthree referral teaching hospitals in the Republic of Korea. We investigated the frequency of vaccination side effects (SEs), the impact on their work productivity, the need for medical attention, and vaccine acceptance. Three groups of HCWs were surveyed: 1406 who had received the first dose of BNT162b2 (BNT162b2#1), 1168 who had received the second dose of BNT162b2 (BNT162b2#2), and 1679 who had received the first dose of ChAdOx1 (ChAdOx1#1). More SEs and impact on work productivity were reported in ChAdOx1#1 than in the other two groups. However, among individuals aged >/=40 years, no significant difference of absence from work was found between ChAdOx1#1 and BN162b2#2 (4.4%, 31/699 vs. 3.0%, 12/405; p = 0.26), and none were hospitalized. Older HCWs in ChAdOx1#1 showed intention to receive the second dose of the vaccine. Although the incidence of SEs and their impacts were greater after the first dose of ChAdOx1 than BNT162b2 in young people, significant impact of SEs seemed to be rare in individuals aged >/=40 years, regardless of the vaccine they received.

34208807	Effects of COVID-19 Lockdown on Physical Activity and Dietary Behaviors in Kuwait: A Cross-Sectional Study. The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought about drastic measures that have significantly altered the norms of daily living. These measures have affected human behaviors in disparate ways. This study seeks to understand the impact of the pandemic on physical activity and dietary behavior among adults living in Kuwait. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between 18 June and 15 July 2020, using a questionnaire disseminated through social media, including WhatsApp and Facebook. The target population was individuals aged 21 years or older living in the State of Kuwait. The study included 679 respondents; 57.9% were females, and 67.7% were Kuwaiti nationals. Both genders reported an increased consumption of vegetables, fruits, and carbohydrates, and a decreased consumption of fish and sugary drinks. Compared to males, females reported eating more during the outbreak than their pre-pandemic eating behaviors (32.3% vs. 35.9%, p < 0.05). Approximately one-third of respondents (33.1%) reported performing less than 30 min of physical activity or exercise in a week, and 36.4% of respondents rated their quality of sleep as 'poor' or 'very poor'. The rate of smoking cigarettes among males was significantly higher than in females (40.6% vs. 5.3%, p < 0.001). Physical activity was positively correlated with vegetable consumption and quality of sleep. Quality of sleep was negatively correlated with the consumption of sweets and snacks, just as the consumption of vegetables was negatively correlated with the consumption of sugary drinks. The overall negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait necessitates the development of health promotion interventions to support positive physical activity and dietary behaviors using alternative coping strategies among the residents of Kuwait.

34284821	Preventive behaviours and family inequalities during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in China. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an international public health threat, and people's participation in disease-related preventive behaviours is the key to controlling infectious diseases. This study aimed to assess the differences in adopting preventive behaviours among populations to explore potential individual and household factors and inequalities within families. METHODS: This online survey was conducted in April 2020. The directional stratified convenient sampling method was used to select 4704 participants from eight provinces in eastern, central, and western China. The questionnaire included demographic information, household variables, and five target prevention behaviours. The chi-squared test, binary multilevel model, and Mantel-Haenszel hierarchical analysis were used for data analysis in the study. RESULTS: Approximately 71.2% of the participants had appropriate outdoor prevention, and 32.9% of the participants had indoor protection in place. Sharing behaviours (P < 0.001) and education level (P < 0.001) were positively associated with adopting preventive measures. The inhibiting effect of household crowding and stimulating effect of high household income on preventive behaviours were determined in this study. Household size was negatively associated with living area (beta = -0.057, P < 0.05) and living style (beta = -0.077, P < 0.05). Household income was positively associated with age (beta = 0.023, P < 0.05), and relationship with friends (beta = 0.053, P < 0.05). Vulnerable groups, such as older adults or women, are more likely to have inadequate preventive behaviours. Older adults (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.09-2.15), women (OR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.15-1.64), and those with more than 2 suspected symptoms (OR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.07-3.19) were more likely to be affected by the inhibiting effect of household crowding, while the stimulating effect of high household income was limited in these groups. CONCLUSIONS: Inequalities in COVID-19 prevention behaviours exist between families and inadequate adoption of prevention by vulnerable groups are noteworthy. This study expands the research perspective by emphasizing the role of household factors in preventive behaviours and by focusing on family inequalities. The government should use traditional media as a platform to enhance residents' public health knowledge. Targeted additional wage subsidies, investments in affordable housing, financial support for multigenerational households, and temporary relocation policies may deserve more attention. Communities could play a critical role in COVID-19 prevention.	Prevention
34202018	Changes in Domestic Energy and Water Usage during the UK COVID-19 Lockdown Using High-Resolution Temporal Data. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the UK Government provided public health advice to stay at home from 16 March 2020, followed by instruction to stay at home (full lockdown) from 24 March 2020. We use data with high temporal resolution from utility sensors installed in 280 homes across social housing in Cornwall, UK, to test for changes in domestic electricity, gas and water usage in response to government guidance. Gas usage increased by 20% following advice to stay at home, the week before full lockdown, although no difference was seen during full lockdown itself. During full lockdown, morning electricity usage shifted to later in the day, decreasing at 6 a.m. and increasing at midday. These changes in energy were echoed in water usage, with a 17% increase and a one-hour delay in peak morning usage. Changes were consistent with people getting up later, spending more time at home and washing more during full lockdown. Evidence for these changes was also observed in later lockdowns, but not between lockdowns. Our findings suggest more compliance with an enforced stay-at-home message than with advice. We discuss implications for socioeconomically disadvantaged households given the indication of inability to achieve increased energy needs during the pandemic.	Prevention
34199143	Real-World Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccines among Healthcare Workers in Perinatal Medicine in China. Surveys showed that vaccine hesitancy may influence the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in healthcare workers (HCWs) and the general population. Currently, the actual acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in HCWs has rarely been reported. In the present survey, we investigated the real-world acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in HCWs in perinatal medicine during the first three-month period of vaccination in China and to identify the main reason for the decline of vaccination. HCWs (1087) who participated in a Chinese national symposium on perinatal medicine during 16-18 April 2021 were invited to answer a 27-question questionnaire online. A total of 1051 HCWs completed the questionnaire. Of them, 86.2% (906/1051) accepted the COVID-19 vaccination and 13.8% (145/1051) declined the vaccination. Because of the vaccine hesitancy, one-fourth of the vaccinated participants did not accept the vaccination until consulted with others or requested by employers. The main reason for the decline of vaccination in 145 unvaccinated HCWs was the concern about vaccine safety. The results indicate that vaccination request by employers may promote vaccine acceptance. More convincing data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines appears to be important to increase the acceptance of vaccination.	Prevention
34337584	Genomic surveillance to combat COVID-19: challenges and opportunities. Although the development and increasingly widespread availability of effective and safe vaccines provides the greatest hope for the future recovery from the increasingly devastating COVID-19 pandemic, there are other preventive efforts that offer an immediate route to decreasing morbidity and mortality. Genomic surveillance is emerging as a vital necessity to achieve effective mitigation and containment. Since SARS-CoV-2 variants have already been detected, it is crucial to obtain reliable evidence about whether they are more contagious, virulent, or more resistant to the available COVID-19 vaccines well before they spread throughout the world. Genomic surveillance leverages applications of next-generation sequencing, creates the availability of whole genome data, and advances phylogenetic methods. These methods offer novel means to detect variants that are phenotypically or antigenically different. Genomic surveillance will facilitate greater early anticipation as well as initiation of effective strategies to mitigate and contain outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 variants and other novel viruses.

34222129	Inside the story about the research and development of COVID-19 vaccines. The ongoing coronavirus threat from China has spread rapidly to other nations and has been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). The pandemic has resulted in over half of the world's population living under conditions of lockdown. Several academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies that are in different stages of development have plunged into the vaccine development race against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The demand for immediate therapy and potential prevention of COVID-19 is growing with the increase in the number of individuals affected due to the seriousness of the disease, global dissemination, lack of prophylactics, and therapeutics. The challenging part is a need for vigorous testing for immunogenicity, safety, efficacy, and level of protection conferred in the hosts for the vaccines. As the world responds to the COVID-19 pandemic, we face the challenge of an overabundance of information related to the virus. Inaccurate information and myths spread widely and at speed, making it more difficult for the public to identify verified facts and advice from trusted sources, such as their local health authority or WHO. This review focuses on types of vaccine candidates against COVID-19 in clinical as well as in the preclinical development platform.	Treatment
34226825	Testosterone Deficiency Is a Risk Factor for Severe COVID-19. Background: Male sex is related to increased COVID-19 severity and fatality although confirmed infections are similarly distributed between men and women. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to investigate the impact of sex hormones on disease progression and immune activation in men with COVID-19. Patients and Methods: We studied for effects of sex hormones on disease severity and immune activation in 377 patients (230 men, 147 women) with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections hospitalized at the Innsbruck University Hospital between February and December 2020. Results: Men had more severe COVID-19 with concomitant higher immune system activation upon hospital admission when compared to women. Men with a severe course of infection had lower serum total testosterone (tT) levels whereas luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol (E2) levels were within the normal range. tT deficiency was associated with elevated CRP (rs = - 0.567, p < 0.001), IL-6 levels (rs = - 0.563, p < 0.001), lower cholesterol levels (rs = 0.407, p < 0.001) and an increased morbidity and mortality. Men with tT levels < 100 ng/dL had a more than eighteen-fold higher in-hospital mortality risk (OR 18.243 [95%CI 2.301 - 144.639], p = 0.006) compared to men with tT levels > 230 ng/dL. Moreover, while morbidity and mortality showed a positive correlation with E2 levels at admission, we detected a negative correlation with the tT/E2 ratio upon hospital admission. Conclusion: Hospitalized men with COVID-19 present with rather low testosterone levels linked to more advanced immune activation, severe clinical manifestations translating into an increased risk for ICU admission or death. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive but may include infection driven hypogonadism as well as inflammation mediated cholesterol reduction causing gonadotropin suppression and impaired androgen formation. Finally, in elderly late onset hypogonadism might also contribute to lower testosterone levels.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Treatment
34203729	A Comprehensive Overview on the Production of Vaccines in Plant-Based Expression Systems and the Scope of Plant Biotechnology to Combat against SARS-CoV-2 Virus Pandemics. Many pathogenic viral pandemics have caused threats to global health; the COVID-19 pandemic is the latest. Its transmission is growing exponentially all around the globe, putting constraints on the health system worldwide. A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes this pandemic. Many candidate vaccines are available at this time for COVID-19, and there is a massive international race underway to procure as many vaccines as possible for each country. However, due to heavy global demand, there are strains in global vaccine production. The use of a plant biotechnology-based expression system for vaccine production also represents one part of this international effort, which is to develop plant-based heterologous expression systems, virus-like particles (VLPs)-vaccines, antiviral drugs, and a rapid supply of antigen-antibodies for detecting kits and plant origin bioactive compounds that boost the immunity and provide tolerance to fight against the virus infection. This review will look at the plant biotechnology platform that can provide the best fight against this global pandemic.	Treatment
34292868	User Experiences of the New Zealand COVID Tracer App: Thematic Analysis of Interviews. BACKGROUND: For mobile app based COVID-19 contact tracing to be fully effective, a large majority of the population needs to be using the app on an on-going basis. However, there is a paucity of studies of users (as opposite to potential adopters) of mobile contact tracing apps and of their experiences. New Zealand, a high-income country with western political culture, was successful in managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and its experience is valuable for informing policy responses in similar contexts. OBJECTIVE: This study pursues the following research questions: (1) How do the users experience the app in their everyday contexts? (2) What drives the use of the app? METHODS: Residents of New Zealand's Auckland region, which encompasses the country's largest city, were approached via Facebook, and 34 COVID Tracer app users were interviewed. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Interviews ranged in duration from 15 to 50 minutes. Participants ranged from those in late teens to those in early sixties. Even though about half of the participants identified as white New Zealanders of European origin, different ethnicities were represented, including New Zealanders of South Pacific, Indian, Mid-Eastern, South-American, and South-East Asian descent. Two of the participants identified as Maori (Indigenous New Zealanders). A broad range of careers was represented, from top-middle management to health support work and charity work. Likewise, educational backgrounds ranged broadly, from high school completion to Master's degrees. Two of the participants were unemployed, having recently lost their jobs because of the pandemic. The thematic analysis resulted in five major themes: perceived benefits, patterns of use, privacy, social influence, and need for collective action. Benefits of using the app to society in general were more salient to the participants than immediate health benefits to the individual. Use, however, depended on alert level, and tended to decline for many participants at low alert levels. Privacy considerations played little role in shaping adoption and use, even though the participants were highly aware of privacy discourse around the app. Participants were aware of the need for high levels of adoption and use of the app to control the pandemic. Attempts to encourage others to use the app were common, although not always successful. CONCLUSIONS: Appeals to civic responsibility are likely to drive the use of a mobile contact tracing app under the conditions of high threat. Under the likely scenario of COVID-19 remaining endemic and requiring on-going vigilance over the long term, other mechanisms promoting the use of mobile contact tracing apps may be needed, such as offering incentives. As privacy is not an important concern for many users, flexible privacy settings in mobile contact tracing apps allowing users to set their optimal levels of privacy may be appropriate.	Prevention
34225760	Community-based surveillance in internally displaced people's camps and urban settings during a complex emergency in Yemen in 2020. BACKGROUND: The need for early identification of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in communities was high in Yemen during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic because most cases presenting to health facilities were severe. Early detection of cases would allow early interventions to interrupt the transmission chains. This study aimed to describe the implementation of community-based surveillance (CBS) in in internally displaced people (IDP) camps and urban settings in Yemen from 15 April 2020 to 30 September 2020. METHODS: Following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for evaluation of surveillance systems, we assessed the usefulness and acceptability of CBS. For acceptability, we calculated the proportion of trained volunteers who reported disease alerts. To assess the usefulness, we compared the alerts reported through the electronic diseases early warning system (eDEWS) with the alerts reported through CBS and described the response activities implemented. RESULTS: In Al-Mukalla City, 18% (14/78) of the volunteers reported at least one alert. In IDP camps, 58% (18/31) of volunteers reported at least one alert. In Al-Mukalla City, CBS detected 49 alerts of influenza-like illness, whereas health facilities detected 561 cases of COVID-19. In IDP camps, CBS detected 91 alerts of influenza-like illness, compared to 10 alerts detected through eDEWS. In IDP camps, CBS detected three other syndromes besides influenza-like illness (febrile illness outbreak suspicion, acute diarrhoea, and skin disease). In IDP camps, public health actions were implemented for each disease detected and no further cases were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In Yemen, CBS was useful for detecting suspected outbreaks in IDP camps. CBS implementation did not yield expected results in general communities in urban areas in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic when little was known about the disease. In the urban setting, the system failed to detect suspected COVID-19 cases and other diseases despite the ongoing outbreaks reported through eDEWS. In Yemen, as in other countries, feasibility and acceptability studies should be conducted few months before CBS expansion in urban communities. The project should be expanded in IDP camps, by creating COVID-19 and other disease outbreak reporting sites.	Prevention
34202168	Geographical Detector-Based Spatial Modeling of the COVID-19 Mortality Rate in the Continental United States. Investigating the spatial distribution patterns of disease and suspected determinants could help one to understand health risks. This study investigated the potential risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in the continental United States. We collected death cases of COVID-19 from 3108 counties from 23 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. Twelve variables, including demographic (the population density, percentage of 65 years and over, percentage of non-Hispanic White, percentage of Hispanic, percentage of non-Hispanic Black, and percentage of Asian individuals), air toxins (PM2.5), climate (precipitation, humidity, temperature), behavior and comorbidity (smoking rate, cardiovascular death rate) were gathered and considered as potential risk factors. Based on four geographical detectors (risk detector, factor detector, ecological detector, and interaction detector) provided by the novel Geographical Detector technique, we assessed the spatial risk patterns of COVID-19 mortality and identified the effects of these factors. This study found that population density and percentage of non-Hispanic Black individuals were the two most important factors responsible for the COVID-19 mortality rate. Additionally, the interactive effects between any pairs of factors were even more significant than their individual effects. Most existing research examined the roles of risk factors independently, as traditional models are usually unable to account for the interaction effects between different factors. Based on the Geographical Detector technique, this study's findings showed that causes of COVID-19 mortality were complex. The joint influence of two factors was more substantial than the effects of two separate factors. As the COVID-19 epidemic status is still severe, the results of this study are supposed to be beneficial for providing instructions and recommendations for the government on epidemic risk responses to COVID-19.

34366646	The COVID-19 Pandemic: New Knowledge on the Impact of Air Quality on the Spread of Coronavirus Infection in Cities. Suspended substances in the air form clusters with coronavirus particles and spread up to 10 m from the source of infection. The importance of taking air pollution into account when simulating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is due to the similarity in the health impacts made by the coronavirus and the respirable fraction of suspended solids. In Europe, up to 6.6% of deaths and in China up to 11% of deaths from COVID-19 are due to ambient air pollution. In epidemiological models, this factor must be considered along with other reasons for the development of coronavirus infection. In Russian cities, increased air pollution can be one of the risk factors for the development of an epidemic.	Prevention

The studies presented at the virtual American College of Cardiology Scientific Session 2021 represent remarkable contributions in the field of cardiovascular disease and prevention.	Treatment
34288702	Heat-treated virus inactivation rate depends strongly on treatment procedure: illustration with SARS-CoV-2. Decontamination helps limit environmental transmission of infectious agents. It is required for the safe re-use of contaminated medical, laboratory and personal protective equipment, and for the safe handling of biological samples. Heat treatment is a common decontamination method, notably used for viruses. We show that for liquid specimens (here, solution of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture medium), virus inactivation rate under heat treatment at 70 degrees C can vary by almost two orders of magnitude depending on the treatment procedure, from a half-life of 0.86 min (95% credible interval: [0.09, 1.77]) in closed vials in a heat block to 37.00 min ([12.65, 869.82]) in uncovered plates in a dry oven. These findings suggest a critical role of evaporation in virus inactivation via dry heat. Placing samples in open or uncovered containers may dramatically reduce the speed and efficacy of heat treatment for virus inactivation. Given these findings, we reviewed the literature temperature-dependent coronavirus stability and found that specimen containers, and whether they are closed, covered, or uncovered, are rarely reported in the scientific literature. Heat-treatment procedures must be fully specified when reporting experimental studies to facilitate result interpretation and reproducibility, and must be carefully considered when developing decontamination guidelines. Importance Heat is a powerful weapon against most infectious agents. It is widely used for decontamination of medical, laboratory and personal protective equipment, and for biological samples. There are many methods of heat treatment, and methodological details can affect speed and efficacy of decontamination. We applied four different heat-treatment procedures to liquid specimens containing SARS-CoV-2. Our results show that the container used to store specimens during decontamination can substantially affect inactivation rate: for a given initial level of contamination, decontamination time can vary from a few minutes in closed vials to several hours in uncovered plates. Reviewing the literature, we found that container choices and heat treatment methods are only rarely reported explicitly in methods sections. Our study shows that careful consideration of heat-treatment procedure - in particular the choice of specimen container, and whether it is covered - can make results more consistent across studies, improve decontamination practice, and provide insight into the mechanisms of virus inactivation.

BACKGROUND: The epidemiological situation generated by COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of applying non-pharmacological measures in the management of the epidemic. Mass screening of the asymptomatic general population has been established as a priority strategy by carrying out diagnostic tests to detect possible cases, isolate contacts, cut transmission chains and thus limit the spread of the virus. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the economic impact of mass COVID-19 screenings of an asymptomatic population during the first and second wave of the epidemic in Catalonia, Spain. METHODOLOGY: Cost-Benefit Analysis based on the estimated total costs of mass screening versus health gains and associated health costs avoided. RESULTS: Excluding the value of monetized health, the Benefit-Cost ratio was estimated at 0.45, a low value that would seem to advise against mass screening policies. However, if monetized health is included, the ratio is close to 1.20, reversing the interpretation. In other words, the monetization of health is the critical element that tips the scales in favour of the desirability of screening. Results show that the interventions with the highest return are those that maximize the percentage of positives detected. CONCLUSION: Efficient management of resources for the policy of mass screening in asymptomatic populations can generate high social returns. The positivity rate critically determines its desirability. Likewise, precocity in the detection of cases will cut more transmissions in the chain of contagion and increase the economic return of these interventions. Maximizing the value of resources depends on screening strategies being accompanied by contact-tracing and specific in their focus, targeting, for example, high-risk subpopulations with the highest rate of expected positives.

34218284	Long-Term Persistence of Spike Antibody and Predictive Modeling of Antibody Dynamics Following Infection with SARS-CoV-2. BACKGROUND: Antibodies to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been shown to neutralize the virus in-vitro and prevent disease in animal challenge models upon re-exposure. However, current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 humoral dynamics and longevity is conflicting. METHODS: The Co-Stars study prospectively enrolled 3679 healthcare workers to comprehensively characterize the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), receptor-binding-domain (RBD) and nucleoprotein (N) antibodies in parallel. Participants screening seropositive had serial monthly serological testing for a maximum of 7 months with the Mesoscale Discovery Assay. Survival analysis determined the proportion of sero-reversion while two hierarchical Gamma models predicted the upper- and lower-bounds of long-term antibody trajectory. RESULTS: A total of 1163 monthly samples were provided from 349 seropositive participants. At 200 days post-symptoms, >95% of participants had detectable S-antibodies compared to 75% with detectable N-antibodies. S-antibody was predicted to remain detectable in 95% of participants until 465 days [95%CI 370-575] using a 'continuous-decay' model and indefinitely using a 'decay-to-plateau' model to account for antibody secretion by long-lived plasma cells. S-antibody titers correlated strongly with surrogate neutralization in-vitro (R 2=0.72). N-antibodies, however, decayed rapidly with a half-life of 60 days [95%CI 52-68]. CONCLUSIONS: The Co-STAR's study data presented here provides evidence for long-term persistence of neutralizing S-antibodies. This has important implications for the duration of functional immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, the rapid decay of N-antibodies must be considered in future seroprevalence studies and public health decision-making. This is the first study to establish a mathematical framework capable of predicting long-term humoral dynamics following SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
34340714	Addressing vaccine hesitancy and access barriers to achieve persistent progress in Israel's COVID-19 vaccination program. As of March 31, 2021, Israel had administered 116 doses of vaccine for COVID-19 per 100 population (of any age) - far more than any other OECD country. It was also ahead of other OECD countries in terms of the share of the population that had received at least one vaccination (61%) and the share that had been fully vaccinated (55%). Among Israelis aged 16 and over, the comparable figures were 81 and 74%, respectively. In light of this, the objectives of this article are: 1. To describe and analyze the vaccination uptake through the end of March 2021 2. To identify behavioral and other barriers that likely affected desire or ability to be vaccinated 3. To describe the efforts undertaken to overcome those barriers Israel's vaccination campaign was launched on December 20, and within 2.5 weeks, 20% of Israelis had received their first dose. Afterwards, the pace slowed. It took an additional 4 weeks to increase from 20 to 40% and yet another 6 weeks to increase from 40 to 60%. Initially, uptake was low among young adults, and two religious/cultural minority groups - ultra-Orthodox Jews and Israeli Arabs, but their uptake increased markedly over time.In the first quarter of 2021, Israel had to enhance access to the vaccine, address a moderate amount of vaccine hesitancy in its general population, and also address more intense pockets of vaccine hesitancy among young adults and religious/cultural minority groups. A continued high rate of infection during the months of February and March, despite broad vaccination coverage at the time, created confusion about vaccine effectiveness, which in turn contributed to vaccine hesitancy. Among Israeli Arabs, some residents of smaller villages encountered difficulties in reaching vaccination sites, and that also slowed the rate of vaccination.The challenges were addressed via a mix of messaging, incentives, extensions to the initial vaccine delivery system, and other measures. Many of the measures addressed the general population, while others were targeted at subgroups with below-average vaccination rates. Once the early adopters had been vaccinated, it took hard, creative work to increase population coverage from 40 to 60% and beyond.Significantly, some of the capacities and strategies that helped Israel address vaccine hesitancy and geographic access barriers are different from those that enabled it to procure, distribute and administer the vaccines. Some of these strategies are likely to be relevant to other countries as they progress from the challenges of securing an adequate vaccine supply and streamlining distribution to the challenge of encouraging vaccine uptake.

34225251	Auto-immune hepatitis following COVID vaccination. Unprecedented loss of life due to the COVID pandemic has necessitated the development of several vaccines in record time. Most of these vaccines have received approval without being extensively whetted for their adverse effect and efficacy profiles. Most adverse effects have been mild, nonetheless, more serious thromboembolic events have also been reported. Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) can occur in predisposed individuals where an immune mediated reaction against hepatocytes is triggered by environmental factors. Vaccines are a very rare cause of AIH. We report two such cases of AIH triggered by COVID (Covishield) vaccination. While one patient made an uneventful recovery, another succumbed to the liver disease. Ours is the first report of Covishield vaccination related AIH and second ever after any form of COVID vaccination. We hope that our report does not deter COVID vaccination drives. However, we also hope to raise awareness of its potential side effects and the increased role of pharmacovigilance in guiding treatment.	Case Report
34360686	Perspective of the Relationship between the Susceptibility to Initial SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity and Optimal Nasal Conditioning of Inhaled Air. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as with the influenza virus, has been shown to spread more rapidly during winter. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which can follow SARS-CoV-2 infection, disproportionately affects older persons and males as well as people living in temperate zone countries with a tropical ancestry. Recent evidence on the importance of adequately warming and humidifying (conditioning) inhaled air in the nasal cavity for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in the upper respiratory tract (URT) is discussed, with particular reference to: (i) the relevance of air-borne SARS-CoV-2 transmission, (ii) the nasal epithelium as the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection, (iii) the roles of type 1 and 3 interferons for preventing viral infection of URT epithelial cells, (iv) weaker innate immune responses to respiratory viral infections in URT epithelial cells at suboptimal temperature and humidity, and (v) early innate immune responses in the URT for limiting and eliminating SARS-CoV-2 infections. The available data are consistent with optimal nasal air conditioning reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of the URT and, as a consequence, severe COVID-19. Further studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and viral loads in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in relation to inhaled air temperature, humidity, age, gender, and genetic background are needed in this context. Face masks used for reducing air-borne virus transmission can also promote better nasal air conditioning in cold weather. Masks can, thereby, minimise SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and are particularly relevant for protecting more vulnerable persons from severe COVID-19.	Prevention;Transmission
34378235	A statistical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 infections and their case detection ratio in 2020. The case detection ratio of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections varies over time due to changing testing capacities, different testing strategies, and the evolving underlying number of infections itself. This note shows a way of quantifying these dynamics by jointly modeling the reported number of detected COVID-19 infections with nonfatal and fatal outcomes. The proposed methodology also allows to explore the temporal development of the actual number of infections, both detected and undetected, thereby shedding light on the infection dynamics. We exemplify our approach by analyzing German data from 2020, making only use of data available since the beginning of the pandemic. Our modeling approach can be used to quantify the effect of different testing strategies, visualize the dynamics in the case detection ratio over time, and obtain information about the underlying true infection numbers, thus enabling us to get a clearer picture of the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

34281515	Changes in prevalence of nosocomial infection pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic from a tertiary Hospital in China. BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections (NIs) are an important cause of mortality, and increasing evidence reveals that the prevalence of NIs can be reduced through effective prevention and control measures. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the prevention and control measures for the COVID-19 pandemic on NIs. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the prevalence of NIs before and after COVID-19 pandemic for 6 months in the Children's Hospital of Soochow University. RESULTS: A total of 39,914 patients in 2019 and 34,645 patients in 2020 were admitted to the hospital during the study. There were 1.39% (481/34645) of patients with NIs in 2020, which was significantly lower than the 2.56% (1021/39914) of patients in 2019. The rate of critical and fatal cases was also decreased. In addition, the rate of appropriate handwashing, the number of protective gloves and aprons used per person and the number of healthcare staff per patients were significantly increased. Except for the ICU, the prevalence of nosocomial infection in most departments decreased from 2019 to 2020. Regarding the source of infections, a significant reduction was mainly observed in respiratory (0.99% vs 0.42%, p = 0.000) and digestive tract (0.63% vs 0.14%, p = 0.000). The microorganism analysis of respiratory infections indicated an obvious decline in acinetobacters and fungi. The most significant decline of pathogens in gastrointestinal infections was observed for rotavirus. The comparison of catheter-related nosocomial infections between 2019 and 2020 did not show significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: The prevention and control measures for the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced the nosocomial infection in almost all departments, except the ICU, mainly regarding respiratory, gastrointestinal, and oral infections, while catheter-related infections did not show any differences.

34362872	Phylogenomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from third wave clusters in Malaysia reveals dominant local lineage B.1.524 and persistent spike mutation A701V. The emergence of a third wave of COVID-19 infection in Malaysia since September 2020 has led to imminent changes in public health prevention and control measures. As high as 96.2% of registered COVID-19 cases and 88.5% of confirmed deaths in Malaysia occurred during this third wave of infection. A phylogenomic study on 258 SARS-CoV-2 full genomes from February 2020-February 2021 has led to the discovery of a novel Malaysian lineage B.1.524. This lineage contains another spike mutation A701V that co-exists with the D614G spike mutation that was predominant in most of the third-wave clusters. The study provides vital genomic insights on the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 variants in Malaysia in conjunction with the presence of a dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage during the third wave of COVID-19 infection.

34335504	"Coronavirus, the King Who Wanted More Than a Crown: From Common to the Highly Pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, Is the Key in the Accessory Genes? Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that emerged in late 2019, is the etiologic agent of the current ""coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19) pandemic, which has serious health implications and a significant global economic impact. Of the seven human coronaviruses, all of which have a zoonotic origin, the pandemic SARS-CoV-2, is the third emerging coronavirus, in the 21st century, highly pathogenic to the human population. Previous human coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV) have already provided several valuable information on some of the common molecular and cellular mechanisms of coronavirus infections as well as their origin. However, to meet the new challenge caused by the SARS-CoV-2, a detailed understanding of the biological specificities, as well as knowledge of the origin are crucial to provide information on viral pathogenicity, transmission and epidemiology, and to enable strategies for therapeutic interventions and drug discovery. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the current advances in SARS-CoV-2 knowledges, in light of pre-existing information of other recently emerging coronaviruses. We depict the specificity of the immune response of wild bats and discuss current knowledge of the genetic diversity of bat-hosted coronaviruses that promotes viral genome expansion (accessory gene acquisition). In addition, we describe the basic virology of coronaviruses with a special focus SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we highlight, in detail, the current knowledge of genes and accessory proteins which we postulate to be the major keys to promote virus adaptation to specific hosts (bat and human), to contribute to the suppression of immune responses, as well as to pathogenicity."

34228322	Detection of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in unexposed renal transplant patients. BACKGROUND: Recent data demonstrate potentially protective pre-existing T cells reactive against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in samples of healthy blood donors, collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Whether pre-existing immunity is also detectable in immunosuppressed patients is currently not known. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients were included in this case-control study. We compared the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in the samples of 20 renal transplant (RTx) patients to 20 age/gender matched non-immunosuppressed/immune competent healthy individuals collected before the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Seventeen coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were used as positive controls. T cell reactivity against Spike-, Nucleocapsid-, and Membrane- SARS-CoV-2 proteins were analyzed by multi-parameter flow cytometry. Antibodies were analyzed by neutralization assay. RESULTS: Pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells were detected in the majority of unexposed patients and healthy individuals. In RTx patients, 13/20 showed CD4(+) T cells reactive against at least one SARS-CoV-2 protein. CD8(+) T cells reactive against at least one SARS-CoV-2 protein were demonstrated in 12/20 of RTx patients. The frequency and Th1 cytokine expression pattern of pre-formed SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells did not differ between RTx and non-immunosuppressed healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the magnitude and functionality of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cell in transplant patients is non-inferior compared to the immune competent cohort. Although several pro-inflammatory cytokines were produced by the detected T cells, further studies are required to prove their antiviral protection.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Treatment
34223444	Initial prehospital Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) to predict outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Objective: The Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) has not been widely studied for use in predicting outcomes of COVID-19 patients encountered in the prehospital setting. This study aimed to determine whether the first prehospital REMS could predict emergency department and hospital dispositions for COVID-19 patients transported by emergency medical services. Methods: This retrospective study used linked prehospital and hospital records from the ESO Data Collaborative for all 911-initiated transports of patients with hospital COVID-19 diagnoses from July 1 to December 31, 2020. We calculated REMS with the first recorded prehospital values for each component. We calculated area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for emergency department (ED) mortality, ED discharge, hospital mortality, and hospital length of stay (LOS). We determined optimal REMS cut-points using test characteristic curves. Results: Among 13,830 included COVID-19 patients, median REMS was 6 (interquartile range [IQR]: 5-9). ED mortality was <1% (n = 80). REMS >/=9 predicted ED death (AUROC 0.79). One-quarter of patients (n = 3,419) were discharged from the ED with an optimal REMS cut-point of </=5 (AUROC 0.72). Eighteen percent (n = 1,742) of admitted patients died. REMS >/=8 optimally predicted hospital mortality (AUROC 0.72). Median hospital LOS was 8.3 days (IQR: 4.1-14.8 days). REMS >/=7 predicted hospitalizations >/=3 days (AUROC 0.62). Conclusion: Initial prehospital REMS was modestly predictive of ED and hospital dispositions for patients with COVID-19. Prediction was stronger for outcomes more proximate to the first set of emergency medical services (EMS) vital signs. These findings highlight the potential value of first prehospital REMS for risk stratification of individual patients and system surveillance for resource planning related to COVID-19.

34218854	Macrovascular Thrombotic Events in a Mayo Clinic Enterprise-Wide Sample of Hospitalized COVID-19-Positive Compared With COVID-19-Negative Patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the difference in the rate of thromboembolic complications between hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive compared with COVID-19-negative patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients hospitalized from January 1, 2020, through May 8, 2020, who had COVID-19 testing by polymerase chain reaction assay were identified through electronic health records across multiple hospitals in the Mayo Clinic enterprise. Thrombotic outcomes (venous and arterial) were identified from the hospital problem list. RESULTS: We identified 3790 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 testing across 19 hospitals, 102 of whom had positive test results. The median age was lower in the COVID-positive patients (62 vs 67 years; P=.03). The median duration of hospitalization was longer in COVID-positive patients (8.5 vs 4 days; P<.001) and more required intensive care unit care (56.9% [58 of 102] vs 26.8% [987 of 3688]; P<.001). Comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation/flutter, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and malignancy, were observed less frequently with COVID-positive admissions. Any venous thromboembolism was identified in 2.9% of COVID-positive patients (3 of 102) and 4.6% of COVID-negative patients (168 of 3688). The frequency of venous and arterial events was not different between the groups. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for COVID-positive-patients for any venous thromboembolism was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.19 to 2.02). A multivariable logistic regression model evaluated death within 30 days of hospital discharge; neither COVID positivity (adjusted OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.54 to 2.34) nor thromboembolism (adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.32) was associated with death. CONCLUSION: Early experience in patients with COVID-19 across multiple academic and regional hospitals representing different US regions demonstrates a lower than previously reported incidence of thrombotic events. This incidence was not higher than a contemporary COVID-negative hospitalized comparator.	Diagnosis
34199240	Relative COVID-19 Viral Persistence and Antibody Kinetics. A total of 15 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients were admitted to our hospital during the in-itial outbreak in Taiwan. The average time of virus clearance was delayed in seven patients, 24.14 +/- 4.33 days compared to 10.25 +/- 0.56 days post-symptom onset (PSO) in the other eight pa-tients. There was strong antibody response in patients with viral persistence at the pharynx, with peak values of serum antibody 677.2 +/- 217.8 vs. 76.70 +/- 32.11 in patients with delayed versus rapid virus clearance. The patients with delayed viral clearance had excessive antibodies of compromised quality in an early stage with the delay in peak virus neutralization efficacy, 34.14 +/- 7.15 versus 12.50 +/- 2.35 days PSO in patients with rapid virus clearance. Weak antibody re-sponse of patients with rapid viral clearance was also effective, with substantial and comparable neutralization efficacy, 35.70 +/- 8.78 versus 41.37 +/- 11.49 of patients with delayed virus clearance. Human Cytokine 48-Plex Screening of the serial sera samples revealed elevated concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in a deceased patient with delayed virus clear-ance and severe disease. The levels were comparatively less in the other two patients who suf-fered from severe disease but eventually survived.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34373829	Novel Face Mask Detection Technique using Machine Learning to control COVID'19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has been scattering speedily around the world since 2019. Due to this pandemic, human life is becoming increasingly involutes and complex. Many people have died because of this virus. The lack of antiviral drugs is one of the reasons for the spreading of COVID-19 virus. This disease is spreading continuously and easily due to some common mistakes by people, like breathing, coughing and sneezing by infected persons. The main symptom is the normal flu. Therefore, in the present condition, the best precaution for this disease is the face mask, which covers both areas of mouth & nose. According to the government and the World Health Organization, everyone should wear a face mask in busy places like hospitals and marketplaces. In today's environment, it's difficult to tell if someone is wearing a mask or not, and physical inspection is impractical since it adds to labour costs. In this research, we present a mask detector that uses a machine learning facial categorization system to determine whether a person is wearing a mask or not, so that it may be connected to a CCTV system to verify that only persons wearing masks are allowed in.

34200380	Methodology for Addressing Infectious Aerosol Persistence in Real-Time Using Sensor Network. Human exposure to infectious aerosols results in the transmission of diseases such as influenza, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. Most dental procedures generate a significant number of aerosolized particles, increasing transmission risk in dental settings. Since the generation of aerosols in dentistry is unavoidable, many clinics have started using intervention strategies such as area-filtration units and extraoral evacuation equipment, especially under the relatively recent constraints of the pandemic. However, the effectiveness of these devices in dental operatories has not been studied. Therefore, the ability of dental personnel to efficiently position and operate such instruments is also limited. To address these challenges, we utilized a real-time sensor network for assessment of aerosol dynamics during dental restoration and cleaning producers with and without intervention. The strategies tested during the procedures were (i) local area High-Efficiency Particle Air (HEPA) filters and (ii) Extra-Oral Suction Device (EOSD). The study was conducted at the University of Washington School of Dentistry using a network of 13 fixed sensors positioned within the operatory and one wearable sensor worn by the dental operator. The sensor network provides time and space-resolved particulate matter (PM) data. Three-dimensional (3D) visualization informed aerosol persistence in the operatory. It was found that area filters did not improve the overall aerosol concentration in dental offices in a significant way. A decrease in PM concentration by an average of 16% was observed when EOSD equipment was used during the procedures. The combination of real-time sensors and 3D visualization can provide dental personnel and facility managers with actionable feedback to effectively assess aerosol transmission in medical settings and develop evidence-based intervention strategies.

34344318	Dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ireland under mitigation. BACKGROUND: In Ireland and across the European Union the COVID-19 epidemic waves, driven mainly by the emergence of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 have continued their course, despite various interventions from governments. Public health interventions continue in their attempts to control the spread as they wait for the planned significant effect of vaccination. METHODS: To tackle this challenge and the observed non-stationary aspect of the epidemic we used a modified SEIR stochastic model with time-varying parameters, following Brownian process. This enabled us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of COVID-19 with the non-specific hypothesis that it follows a basic stochastic process constrained by the available data. This model is coupled with Bayesian inference (particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method) for parameter estimation and utilized mainly well-documented Irish hospital data. RESULTS: In Ireland, mitigation measures provided a 78-86% reduction in transmission during the first wave between March and May 2020. For the second wave in October 2020, our reduction estimation was around 20% while it was 70% for the third wave in January 2021. This third wave was partly due to the UK variant appearing in Ireland. In June 2020 we estimated that sero-prevalence was 2.0% (95% CI: 1.2-3.5%) in complete accordance with a sero-prevalence survey. By the end of April 2021, the sero-prevalence was greater than 17% due in part to the vaccination campaign. Finally we demonstrate that the available observed confirmed cases are not reliable for analysis owing to the fact that their reporting rate has as expected greatly evolved. CONCLUSION: We provide the first estimations of the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ireland and its key parameters. We also quantify the effects of mitigation measures on the virus transmission during and after mitigation for the three waves. Our results demonstrate that Ireland has significantly reduced transmission by employing mitigation measures, physical distancing and lockdown. This has to date avoided the saturation of healthcare infrastructures, flattened the epidemic curve and likely reduced mortality. However, as we await for a full roll out of a vaccination programme and as new variants potentially more transmissible and/or more infectious could continue to emerge and mitigation measures change silent transmission, challenges remain.

34282461	Kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response and serological estimation of time since infection. BACKGROUND: Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces a complex antibody response that varies by orders of magnitude between individuals and over time. METHODS: We developed a multiplex serological test for measuring antibodies to five SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the Spike proteins of seasonal coronaviruses. We measured antibody responses in cohorts of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers followed for up to eleven months after symptoms. A mathematical model of antibody kinetics was used to quantify the duration of antibody responses. Antibody response data were used to train algorithms for estimating time since infection. RESULTS: One year after symptoms, we estimate that 36% (95% range: 11%, 94%) of anti-Spike IgG remains, 31% (9%, 89%) anti-RBD IgG remains, and 7% (1%, 31%) anti-Nucleocapsid IgG remains. The multiplex assay classified previous infections into time intervals of 0-3 months, 3-6 months, and 6-12 months. This method was validated using data from a sero-prevalence survey in France, demonstrating that historical SARS-CoV-2 transmission can be reconstructed using samples from a single survey. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to diagnosing previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, multiplex serological assays can estimate the time since infection which can be used to reconstruct past epidemics.

34288493	The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on diagnostic imaging services in Australia. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is driving unprecedented changes in healthcare services worldwide. This study aimed to quantify the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on diagnostic imaging services in Australia using an interrupted time series model. METHODS: Monthly data were extracted from the Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule for all diagnostic imaging services performed between January 2016 and December 2019. Holt-Winters forecasting models were developed for total imaging services as well as for each imaging modality. The models were used to predict monthly data between January 2020 and June 2020 with a 95% confidence interval (P < 0.05). Absolute and percentage residual differences (RD) between observed and predicted services for this time period were calculated. RESULTS: There were statistically significant reductions in total imaging services performed in March 2020 (RD: -332260, -13.1%, 95% CI: -17.5% to -8.4%), April 2020 (RD: -716957, -32.4%, 95% CI: -36.2% to -28.1%) and May 2020 (RD: -571634, -21.4%, 95% CI: -25.1% to -17.3%). Nuclear medicine and CT services were relatively less impacted than general radiography, ultrasound, and MRI services. There was also a statistically significant increase in nuclear medicine and CT services performed in June 2020 compared to predicted values. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of COVID-19 in Australia, there was a significant reduction in total diagnostic imaging services, with variable impacts on different imaging modalities. These findings may have significant public health implications and can be used to inform evidence-based strategies in the recovery phase of the pandemic.	Prevention
34207598	Transition from Simple V-V to V-A and Hybrid ECMO Configurations in COVID-19 ARDS. In SARS-CoV-2 patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (V-V ECMO) was shown to provide valuable treatment with reasonable survival in large multi-centre investigations. However, in some patients, conversion to modified ECMO support forms may be needed. In this single-centre retrospective registry, all consecutive patients receiving V-V ECMO between 1 March 2020 to 1 May 2021 were included and analysed. The patient cohort was divided into two groups: those who remained on V-V ECMO and those who required conversion to other modalities. Seventy-eight patients were included, with fourteen cases (18%) requiring conversions to veno-arterial (V-A) or hybrid ECMO. The reasons for the ECMO mode configuration change were inadequate drainage (35.7%), inadequate perfusion (14.3%), myocardial infarction (7.1%), hypovolemic shock (14.3%), cardiogenic shock (14.3%) and septic shock (7.1%). In multivariable analysis, the use of dobutamine (p = 0.007) and a shorter ICU duration (p = 0.047) predicted the conversion. The 30-day mortality was higher in converted patients (log-rank p = 0.029). Overall, only 19 patients (24.4%) survived to discharge or lung transplantation. Adverse events were more common after conversion and included renal, cardiovascular and ECMO-circuit complications. Conversion itself was not associated with mortality in the multivariable analysis. In conclusion, as many as 18% of patients undergoing V-V ECMO for COVID-19 ARDS may require conversion to advanced ECMO support.	Treatment
34289851	Air particulate concentration during orthodontic procedures: a pilot study. BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the particle dispersion involved in dental procedures carried out during orthodontic treatments. Variants such as temperature and relative humidity in the dental cabinet were considered. METHODS: Using a particle counter, a pilot study was conducted, in which 98 consecutive recordings were made during appointments of patients undergoing orthodontic treatments. Temperature, relative humidity and particles present at the beginning (AR) and during the appointment (BR) were recorded. A control record (CR) of temperature, relative humidity and particles present was made before the start of the clinical activity. In addition to conventional statistics, differential descriptive procedures were used to analyse results, and the influence of relative humidity on particle concentration was analysed by statistical modelling with regression equations. RESULTS: The number of particles present, regardless of their size, was much higher in AR than in CR (p < .001). The same was true for relative humidity and ambient temperature. The relationship between relative humidity and particle number was determined to be exponential. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY: The limitations are associated with sample size, environmental conditions of the room and lack of discrimination among the procedures performed. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that from the moment a patient enters a dental office, a large number of additional particles are generated. During treatment, the number of particles of 0.3 microns-which have a high capacity to penetrate the respiratory tract-increases. Moreover, a relationship between relative humidity and particle formation is observed. Further studies are needed.	Prevention
34222293	CT Quantification of COVID-19 Pneumonia at Admission Can Predict Progression to Critical Illness: A Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study. Objective: Early identification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with worse outcomes may benefit clinical management of patients. We aimed to quantify pneumonia findings on CT at admission to predict progression to critical illness in COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective study included laboratory-confirmed adult patients with COVID-19. All patients underwent a thin-section chest computed tomography (CT) scans showing evidence of pneumonia. CT images with severe moving artifacts were excluded from analysis. Patients' clinical and laboratory data were collected from medical records. Three quantitative CT features of pneumonia lesions were automatically calculated using a care.ai Intelligent Multi-disciplinary Imaging Diagnosis Platform Intelligent Evaluation System of Chest CT for COVID-19, denoting the percentage of pneumonia volume (PPV), ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), and consolidation volume (PCV). According to Chinese COVID-19 guidelines (trial version 7), patients were divided into noncritical and critical groups. Critical illness was defined as a composite of admission to the intensive care unit, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or death. The performance of PPV, PGV, and PCV in discrimination of critical illness was assessed. The correlations between PPV and laboratory variables were assessed by Pearson correlation analysis. Results: A total of 140 patients were included, with mean age of 58.6 years, and 85 (60.7%) were male. Thirty-two (22.9%) patients were critical. Using a cutoff value of 22.6%, the PPV had the highest performance in predicting critical illness, with an area under the curve of 0.868, sensitivity of 81.3%, and specificity of 80.6%. The PPV had moderately positive correlation with neutrophil (%) (r = 0.535, p < 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0.567, p < 0.001), d-Dimer (r = 0.444, p < 0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (r = 0.495, p < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.410, p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.644, p < 0.001), and urea nitrogen (r = 0.439, p < 0.001), whereas the PPV had moderately negative correlation with lymphocyte (%) (r = -0.535, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Pneumonia volume quantified on initial CT can non-invasively predict the progression to critical illness in advance, which serve as a prognostic marker of COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34206436	Visitor Capacity Considering Social Distancing in Urban Parks with Agent-Based Modeling. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly influenced society in the past few years. Park accessibility and social distancing are considered important under the threat of a long-term epidemic. However, measures that can maintain park accessibility and diminish virus spreading synchronously have been seldom studied before, which may threaten public health in all major urban parks globally. This paper proposed a methodology based on an agent-based model to analyze capacities for parks by simulating park visitor behaviors when they all are social distancing. The model was derived from historical visitor data and realistic visitor behaviors in three park settings. Then, park capacities of varied contact conditions, different park policies, and layout adjustments were analyzed. First, congestions caused by social distancing without proper visitor control are found inside all parks. Second, 85 to 3972 square meters per person is predicted as a safe space in different parks. Third, the current results can be easily adjusted according to various concerns regarding infection distance and rate. Finally, it can be inferred that information provisions are more effective than space design adjustments and mandatory measures. The results can guide park managers and those who plan and design park settings. They are also helpful in improving knowledge of the mechanisms behind visitor behaviors. Moreover, these findings can be tested and verified in a variety of public spaces with many other contact-based illnesses.	Prevention
34360208	The Study on Public-Interest Short Message Service (SMS) in China during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mobile User Survey and Content Analysis. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has greatly threatened the global health system and triggered the public health emergency. In order to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare and prevention information have been delivered through omni-media channels (e.g., television, radio, social platform, etc.). As a traditional outlet, the short message service (SMS) can timely provide abundant anti-epidemic alerts to mobile users. In this paper, we aim to investigate mobile users' attitudes toward COVID-19 public-interest SMS sent from government authorities and then explore the insight from messaging texts collected between January and April 2020 in China. In general, respondents show a positive attitude towards content and the necessity of public-interest SMS during the pandemic. However, we find that gender and age differences not only affect content evaluation, but also influence reading and forwarding behaviors. For the necessity of SMS, it shows significant difference between the 18-25-year-old and over 40-year-old group, with the middle and elder group showing serious attitudes and giving higher remarks than the youth due to the habits of media usage. However no significant difference is presented between females and males. In terms of content, the category of topics and releasing institutions are analyzed, respectively. Due to the centralized responses and coordination of prevention and control in China, the messages from COVID-19 disposal organizations (e.g., municipal steering group and provincial CDC) account for more than 70% among four cities.

34226230	Are COVID-19 models blind to the social determinants of health? A systematic review protocol. INTRODUCTION: Infectious disease models are important tools to inform public health policy decisions. These models are primarily based on an average population approach and often ignore the role of social determinants in predicting the course of a pandemic and the impact of policy interventions. Ignoring social determinants in models may cause or exacerbate inequalities. This limitation has not been previously explored in the context of the current pandemic, where COVID-19 has been found to disproportionately affect marginalised racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Therefore, our primary goal is to identify the extent to which COVID-19 models incorporate the social determinants of health in predicting outcomes of the pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases from December 2019 to August 2020. We will assess all infectious disease modelling studies for inclusion of social factors that meet the following criteria: (a) focused on human spread of SARS-CoV-2; (b) modelling studies; (c) interventional or non-interventional studies; and (d) focused on one of the following outcomes: COVID-19-related outcomes (eg, cases, deaths), non-COVID-19-related outcomes (ie, impacts of the pandemic or control policies on other health conditions or health services), or impact of the pandemic or control policies on economic outcomes. Data will only be extracted from models incorporating social factors. We will report the percentage of models that considered social factors, indicate which social factors were considered, and describe how social factors were incorporated into the conceptualisation and implementation of the infectious disease models. The extracted data will also be used to create a narrative synthesis of the results. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required as only secondary data will be collected. The results of this systematic review will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and conference proceedings. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020207706.	Prevention
34282450	Excess all-cause mortality and COVID-19-related mortality: a temporal analysis in 22 countries, from January until August 2020. BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate overall and sex-specific excess all-cause mortality since the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic until August 2020 among 22 countries. METHODS: Countries reported weekly or monthly all-cause mortality from January 2015 until the end of June or August 2020. Weekly or monthly COVID-19 deaths were reported for 2020. Excess mortality for 2020 was calculated by comparing weekly or monthly 2020 mortality (observed deaths) against a baseline mortality obtained from 2015-2019 data for the same week or month using two methods: (i) difference in observed mortality rates between 2020 and the 2015-2019 average and (ii) difference between observed and expected 2020 deaths. RESULTS: Brazil, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the UK (England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland) and the USA demonstrated excess all-cause mortality, whereas Australia, Denmark and Georgia experienced a decrease in all-cause mortality. Israel, Ukraine and Ireland demonstrated sex-specific changes in all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: All-cause mortality up to August 2020 was higher than in previous years in some, but not all, participating countries. Geographical location and seasonality of each country, as well as the prompt application of high-stringency control measures, may explain the observed variability in mortality changes.	Prevention
34225644	Sex-based clinical and immunological differences in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Males and females differ in their immunological responses to foreign pathogens. However, most of the current COVID-19 clinical practices and trials do not take the sex factor into consideration. METHODS: We performed a sex-based comparative analysis for the clinical outcomes, peripheral immune cells, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibody levels of 1558 males and 1499 females COVID-19 patients from a single center. The lymphocyte subgroups were measured by Flow cytometry. The total antibody, Spike protein (S)-, receptor binding domain (RBD)-, and nucleoprotein (N)- specific IgM and IgG levels were measured by chemiluminescence. RESULTS: We found that male patients had approximately two-fold rates of ICU admission (4.7% vs. 2.7% in males and females, respectively, P = 0.005) and mortality (3% vs. 1.4%, in males and females, respectively, P = 0.004) than female patients. Survival analysis revealed that the male sex is an independent risk factor for death from COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-3.6, P = 0.003). The level of inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood was higher in males during hospitalization. The renal (102/1588 [6.5%] vs. 63/1499 [4.2%], in males and females, respectively, P = 0.002) and hepatic abnormality (650/1588 [40.9%] vs. 475/1499 [31.7%], P = 0.003) were more common in male patients than in female patients. By analyzing dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets after symptom onset, we found that the percentage of CD19+ B cells and CD4+ T cells was generally higher in female patients during the disease course of COVID-19. Notably, the protective RBD-specific IgG against SARS-CoV-2 sharply increased and reached a peak in the fourth week after symptom onset in female patients, while gradually increased and reached a peak in the seventh week after symptom onset in male patients. CONCLUSIONS: Males had an unfavorable prognosis, higher inflammation, a lower percentage of lymphocytes, and indolent antibody responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery. Early medical intervention and close monitoring are important, especially for male COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Treatment
34352502	Synthesis of gold nanoparticles@reduced porous graphene-modified ITO electrode for spectroelectrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here, we reported the synthesis of reduced porous graphene oxide (rPGO) decorated with gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) to modify the ITO electrode. Then we used this highly uniform Au NPs@rPGO modified ITO electrode as a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy-active surface and a working electrode. The uses of the Au nanoparticles and porous graphene enhance the Raman signals and the electrochemical conductivity. COVID-19 protein-based biosensor was developed based on immobilization of anti-COVID-19 antibodies onto the modified electrode and its uses as a probe for capturing the COVID-19 protein. The developed biosensor showed the capability of monitoring the COVID-19 protein within a concentration range from 100 nmol/L to 1 pmol/L with a limit of detection (LOD) of 75 fmol/L. Furthermore, COVID-19 protein was detected based on electrochemical techniques within a concentration range from 100 nmol/L to 500 fmol/L that showed a LOD of 39.5 fmol/L. Finally, three concentrations of COVID-19 protein spiked in human serum were investigated. Thus, the present sensor showed high efficiency towards the detection of COVID-19.	Diagnosis

34360684	Inflammatory Response in COVID-19 Patients Resulting from the Interaction of the Inflammasome and SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began at the end of 2019. COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and patients with COVID-19 may exhibit poor clinical outcomes. Some patients with severe COVID-19 experience cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or a cytokine storm-elevated levels of hyperactivated immune cells-and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18. This severe inflammatory response can lead to organ damage/failure and even death. The inflammasome is an intracellular immune complex that is responsible for the secretion of IL-1beta and IL-18 in various human diseases. Recently, there has been a growing number of studies revealing a link between the inflammasome and COVID-19. Therefore, this article summarizes the current literature regarding the inflammasome complex and COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34218413	Arterial and venous thrombosis in coronavirus 2019 disease (Covid-19): relationship with mortality. BACKGROUND: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may experience venous thrombosis while data regarding arterial thrombosis are sparse. METHODS: Prospective multicenter study in 5 hospitals including 373 patients with Covid-19-related pneumonia. Demographic data, laboratory findings including coagulation tests and comorbidities were reported. During the follow-up any arterial or venous thrombotic events and death were registered. RESULTS: Among 373 patients, 75 (20%) had a thrombotic event and 75 (20%) died. Thrombotic events included 41 venous thromboembolism and 34 arterial thrombosis. Age, cardiovascular disease, intensive care unit treatment, white blood cells, D-dimer, albumin and troponin blood levels were associated with thrombotic events. In a multivariable regression logistic model, intensive care unit treatment (Odds Ratio [OR]: 6.0; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.8-12.6; p < 0.001); coronary artery disease (OR: 2.4; 95% CI 1.4-5.0; p = 0.022); and albumin levels (OR: 0.49; 95% CI 0.28-0.87; p = 0.014) were associated with ischemic events. Age, sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, heart failure, coronary heart disease, intensive care unit treatment, in-hospital thrombotic events, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, troponin, and albumin levels were associated with mortality. A multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that in-hospital thrombotic events (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.72; 95% CI 1.59-4.65; p < 0.001), age (HR: 1.035; 95% CI 1.014-1.057; p = 0.001), and albumin (HR: 0.447; 95% CI 0.277-0.723; p = 0.001) predicted morality. CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 patients experience an equipollent rate of venous and arterial thrombotic events, that are associated with poor survival. Early identification and appropriate treatment of Covid-19 patients at risk of thrombosis may improve prognosis.	Diagnosis;Treatment
33106890	The neurological sequelae of pandemics and epidemics. Neurological manifestations in pandemics frequently cause short and long-term consequences which are frequently overlooked. Despite advances in the treatment of infectious diseases, nervous system involvement remains a challenge, with limited treatments often available. The under-recognition of neurological manifestations may lead to an increase in the burden of acute disease as well as secondary complications with long-term consequences. Nervous system infection or dysfunction during pandemics is common and its enduring consequences, especially among vulnerable populations, are frequently forgotten. An improved understanding the possible mechanisms of neurological damage during epidemics, and increased recognition of the possible manifestations is fundamental to bring insights when dealing with future outbreaks. To reverse this gap in knowledge, we reviewed all the pandemics, large and important epidemics of human history in which neurological manifestations are evident, and described the possible physiological processes that leads to the adverse sequelae caused or triggered by those pathogens.

34284566	Common anti-oxidant vitamin C as an anti-infective agent with remedial role on SARS-CoV-2 infection. An update. Coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19) has led to a worldwide multifaceted crisis. The medical world agonizes to contend with the problem, but a string of tested medications has been proven unavailing. Vitamin C is well described as a salutary antioxidant and some trials conclude that it may be a potential antiviral drug. In high doses, Vitamin C can alternate crucial steps in the pathogenesis of sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This dynamic was the driving force behind trials around the world that tried immunonutrition as a weapon against clinical entities. We summarize the mechanisms of action of Vitamin C and its role against infections and the current literature referring to the potential role of Vitamin C in SARS-CoV-2 infection, also as a contingent treatment agent.

34336770	Estimated Dissemination Ratio-A Practical Alternative to the Reproduction Number for Infectious Diseases. Policymakers require consistent and accessible tools to monitor the progress of an epidemic and the impact of control measures in real time. One such measure is the Estimated Dissemination Ratio (EDR), a straightforward, easily replicable, and robust measure of the trajectory of an outbreak that has been used for many years in the control of infectious disease in livestock. It is simple to calculate and explain. Its calculation and use are discussed below together with examples from the current COVID-19 outbreak in the UK. These applications illustrate that EDR can demonstrate changes in transmission rate before they may be clear from the epidemic curve. Thus, EDR can provide an early warning that an epidemic is resuming growth, allowing earlier intervention. A conceptual comparison between EDR and the commonly used reproduction number is also provided.	Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34209409	Chronology of COVID-19 Symptoms in Very Old Patients: Study of a Hospital Outbreak. BACKGROUND: We wanted to better understand the frequency and temporal distribution of symptoms of COVID-19 in very old patients, which are currently not well defined. METHODS: In an observational, descriptive study, we followed all patients being at three geriatric convalescence and rehabilitation units when a COVID-19 outbreak emerged in those units in March 2020. For those who developed the disease, we recorded any new symptom occurring at diagnosis, in the previous 14 and the following 21 days. A group of SARS-Cov-2-negative patients served as controls. RESULTS: Sixty-nine of the 176 inpatients (mean age: 86 years) were infected by SARS-Cov-2 during the outbreak. At the moment of diagnosis, a majority of patients had fever (71.0%), malaise-asthenia (24.6%), or respiratory symptoms (66.7%). However, 48 patients (69.6% of all SARS-Cov-2 positive patients) also presented, usually several days before, other symptoms: (a) gastrointestinal symptoms (39.1% of all patients, median onset eight days before diagnosis, IQR -9 to +3 days); (b) neurological symptoms (30.4% of all patients, median onset five days before diagnosis, IQR -11 to -3 days), notably delirium (24.6%); and (c) other symptoms, like falls and unexplained decompensation of chronic conditions (29.0% of all patients, median onset four days before diagnosis, IQR -10 to 0). None of those symptoms were observed in similar proportion in 25 control SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, hospitalized during the same period. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea, nausea-vomiting, delirium, falls, and unexplained decompensation of chronic conditions were the first symptoms of COVID-19 in a majority of older patients in this cohort, preceding typical symptoms by several days. Recognizing those early symptoms could hasten the diagnosis of COVID-19 in this population.	Diagnosis
34200985	Respiratory Telerehabilitation of Boys and Young Men with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy in the COVID-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic forced reorganization of the multidisciplinary healthcare system for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Digital solutions seem to be optimal for providing rehabilitation at this time. The aim of this study was to investigate whether it is possible to conduct respiratory physical therapy with the use of telerehabilitation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. METHODS: The study was conducted during an online conference for families with DMD. During the physical therapy panel we showed the video with the instructions of respiratory exercises. All participants (n = 152) were asked to fill in the online survey evaluating the quality, acceptance, and understanding of the instructions. RESULTS: The survey was filled in by 45 (29.6%) participants. The mean rating of satisfaction was 4.70/5, and for intelligibility was 4.78/5. Thirty-seven (82.2%) patients declared that they had performed the exercises, all caregivers declared that it was possible to perform the proposed exercises a few times a week or daily, and only two respondents replied to invitations to individual online sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the study show that respiratory telerehabilitation may be implemented for DMD patients; however, the interest in digital rehabilitation among caregivers of DMD boys in Poland is low. The reasons for this situation require further research.	Prevention
34219928	Hepatic manifestations of COVID-19 and effect of remdesivir on liver function in patients with COVID-19 illness. COVID-19 has emerged as a major global health crisis since the first cases were reported in China in December 2019. Remdesivir is the only broad-spectrum antiviral approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. Although the adverse effects of remdesivir are largely unknown, data from randomized controlled trials have demonstrated its deleterious effect on the liver. This review briefly addresses the hepatic manifestations of COVID-19 infection and the data regarding the efficacy and adverse effects of remdesivir on liver function when used in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Through a literature search, we identified five randomized controlled trials, two case reports, and one case series, including a total of 2375 patients. Although mild transaminase elevation has been reported as a feature of COVID-19, there has been a concern of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of remdesivir. Based on the limited available data regarding the adverse effects of remdesivir on hepatic function, it is prudent to exercise caution by evaluating baseline liver function, avoiding the use of potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and closely monitoring liver function when using remdesivir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

34207765	Effects of Activity Tracker-Based Counselling and Live-Web Exercise on Breast Cancer Survivors during Italy COVID-19 Lockdown. BACKGROUND: To prevent and fight the increase of daily sedentary time and to promote and stimulate the positive effects of physical activity and exercise on health, both traditional interventions and new strategies are important for breast cancer survivors (BCS). The research goal was to compare the effects of weekly personal feedback, based on objectively measured physical activity, on the trends of both daily sedentary time and on the physical activity of BCS (E(-) group) with those of an intervention also including online supervised physical exercise sessions (E(+) group), during the Italy COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: The Italian COVID-19 emergency allowed the possibility to also observe the effects of social and personal limitations. A total of 51 BCS were studied over an 18-week period and had an objective registration of day-to-day sedentary time, physical activity, and sleep. Both subsamples received weekly or fortnight personal feedback. Data were analysed considering four key periods, according to the COVID-19 emergency steps. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed an additive effect for sedentary time and a multiplicative effect both for light-to vigorous and light-intensity physical activities. The E(-) group had a high overall sedentary time and a different trend of light-to vigorous and light-intensity physical activities, with a reduction from the 1st to the 2nd periods (national and personal restrictions), showing a significant rise just at the end of the national restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an activity tracker and its accompanying app, with the reception of weekly tailored advice and supervised online physical exercise sessions, can elicit proper physical activity recomposition in BCS in the COVID-19 era.

34292433	Echocardiographic assessment of the right ventricle in COVID-19: a systematic review. Cardiac involvement has been frequently reported in COVID-19 as responsible of increased morbidity and mortality. Given the importance of right heart function in acute and chronic respiratory diseases, its assessment in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients may add prognostic accuracy. Transthoracic echocardiography has been proposed to early predict myocardial injury and risk of death in hospitalized patients. This systematic review presents the up-to-date sum of literature regarding right ventricle ultrasound assessment. We evaluated commonly used echocardiographic parameters to assess RV function and discussed their relationship with pathophysiological mechanisms involved in COVID-19. We searched Medline and Embase for studies that used transthoracic echocardiography for right ventricle assessment in patients with COVID-19.	Diagnosis
34220597	Social Media Use, Self-Efficacy, Perceived Threat, and Preventive Behavior in Times of COVID-19: Results of a Cross-Sectional Study in Pakistan. Although the role of social media in infectious disease outbreaks is receiving increasing attention, little is known about the mechanisms by which social media use affects risk perception and preventive behaviors during such outbreaks. This study aims to determine whether there are any relationships between social media use, preventive behavior, perceived threat of coronavirus, self-efficacy, and socio-demographic characteristics. The data were collected from 310 respondents across Pakistan using an online cross-sectional survey. Reliability analyses were performed for all scales and structural equational modeling was used to identify the relationships between study variables. We found that: (i) social media use predicts self-efficacy (beta = 0.25, p < 0.05) and perceived threat of coronavirus (beta = 0.54, p < 0.05, R (2) = 0.06), and (ii) preventive behavior is predicted by self-efficacy and perceived threat of coronavirus (R = 0.10, p < 0.05). Therefore, these results indicate the importance of social media's influence on health-related behaviors. These findings are valuable for health administrators, governments, policymakers, and social scientists, specifically for individuals whose situations are similar to those in Pakistan.	Prevention
33760804	Evidencing the influence of pre-pandemic sports participation and substance misuse on physical activity during the COVID19 lockdown: a prospective analysis among older adolescents. OBJECTIVES: The physical activity level (PAL) has significantly decreased as a result of the social distancing and lockdown related to the COVID19 pandemic, but there is a lack of knowledge on the correlates of PAL during the pandemic. The aim of this research was to examine the influence of pre-pandemic sports participation and substance use and misuse (SUM) on PAL during the COVID19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 661 high-school students from Bosnia and Herzegovina (aged 15-18 years, 292 females). The investigation included 2 testing waves: before the COVID19 pandemic (baseline, January 2020) and during the COVID19 lockdown (follow-up, April 2020). The variables included PAL as measured by the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents, sports factors, and SUM. RESULTS: Sports factors at baseline were positively correlated with PALs at both baseline and follow-up. Smoking tobacco negatively affected PALs at both baseline and follow-up. Alcohol consumption was positively correlated with PAL at baseline but had no effect on PAL at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the importance of sports participation in maintaining PAL during challenging situations, such as the COVID19 lockdown. The substance-specific influence of SUM on PAL before and during the lockdown points to evident social and cultural aspects of SUM behaviors in adolescents. Further studies evidencing the cumulative effects of PAL decline during the lockdown are warranted. Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2021;34(2):151-63.	Prevention
34288386	SARS-CoV-2 in children with cancer in Brazil: Results of a multicenter national registry. BACKGROUND: Strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in special populations are complex and challenging. Few studies have addressed the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric patients with cancer in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: Multicenter observational cohort study with prospective records and retrospective analyses starting in April 2020 in 21 pediatric oncology centers distributed throughout Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Patients under 18 years of age who are infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (confirmed diagnosis through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) while under treatment at pediatric oncology centers. The variables of interest included clinical symptoms, diagnostic and therapeutic measures. The repercussions of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cancer treatment and general prognosis were monitored. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-nine patients were included (median age 6 [4-13] years, 58% male). Of these, 55.9% had acute leukemia and 34.1% had solid tumors. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed by RT-PCR. Various laboratory markers were analyzed, but showed no correlation with outcome. Children with low or high BMI for age had lower overall survival (71.4% and 82.6%, respectively) than those with age-appropriate BMI (92.7%) (p = .007). The severity of presentation at diagnosis was significantly associated with outcome (p < .001). Overall mortality in the presence of infection was 12.3% (n = 22). CONCLUSION: In children with cancer and COVID-19, lower BMI was associated with worse prognosis. The mortality in this group of patients (12.3%) was significantly higher than that described in the pediatric population overall ( approximately 1%).	Diagnosis;Treatment
34217761	Self-reported dietary changes among Los Angeles County adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Poor diets are historically the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States (U.S.), causing over 44,000 deaths each month. Dietary patterns have likely changed during the COVID-19 pandemic due to major shifts and crises in social, economic, and food systems. This study examines self-reported dietary changes in Los Angeles (L.A.) County during COVID-19, and identifies factors associated with making healthy and unhealthy changes. Data are from the Understanding Coronavirus in America Study, an internet panel of adults representative of L.A. County households (N = 1080). Multinomial logistic regression was used to test if self-reported change in diet healthiness assessed in July 2020 was associated with socio-ecological factors known to be associated with diet, assessed between April-July 2020. More than half of L.A. County residents reported making changes to their diet: 28.3% reported eating healthier food since the beginning of the pandemic, while 24.8% reported eating less healthy food. Individuals who were significantly more likely to report healthy changes were Non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic/Latino (vs. Non-Hispanic White), had received unemployment insurance, or had larger social networks. Individuals who were significantly more likely to report unhealthy changes were younger, of mixed race, had children in their household, had transportation barriers, or had obesity. Individuals who were significantly more likely to report both healthy and unhealthy changes were Asian, had experienced food insecurity, or had challenges getting food due to store closures. The pandemic may be exacerbating diet-related disease risk in some groups, such as communities of color, and among individuals with obesity and those facing transportation barriers.	Prevention

Background: Routine childhood immunization is the most cost-effective method to prevent infection and decrease childhood morbidity and mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected access to health care in Saudi Arabia, including mandatory vaccinations for young children. We aimed to assess the prevalence of intentionally delayed vaccinations in children aged </= 2 years during the COVID-19 pandemic curfew in Saudi Arabia, its relation to the caregivers' fear of infection, and identifying factors affecting the caregivers' decision. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a self-administered survey that targeted primary caregivers of children aged </= 2 years residing in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic curfew (March 4-July 6, 2020). Results: We received responses from 577 caregivers, of whom 90.8% were mothers. The prevalence of intentional vaccination delay was 37%. Upon adjusting the potential confounders, the odds of delaying scheduled childhood vaccination because of COVID-19 pandemic fears were greater among caregivers with higher levels of fear (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.11). Common reasons for delaying vaccinations were COVID-19 infection and prevention of exposure to COVID-19 cases. Conclusion: Intentional vaccination delay leaves young children vulnerable to preventable infectious diseases. Identifying these children and offering catch-up vaccinations reduces this risk. Campaigns to increase awareness about the dangers of delaying vaccine-preventable diseases must be promoted to caregivers in addition to the promotion of home vaccination services. In preparation for future pandemics, we recommend countries consider interventions to control the level of fear and anxiety provoked by the pandemics and media, and interventions for improved access to vaccinations.

34217695	Comparative bench study evaluation of a modified snorkeling mask used during COVID-19 pandemic and standard interfaces for non-invasive ventilation. PURPOSE: The aim of this bench study is to compare the standard NIV and nCPAP devices (Helmet, H; Full face mask, FFM) with a modified full face snorkeling mask used during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A mannequin was connected to an active lung simulator. The inspiratory and expiratory variations in airways pressure observed with a high simulated effort, were determined relative to the preset CPAP level. NIV was applied in Pressure Support Mode at two simulated respiratory rates and two cycling-off flow thresholds. During the bench study, we measured the variables defining patient-ventilator interaction and performance. RESULTS: During nCPAP, the tested interfaces did not show significant differences in terms of Pawi and Pawe. During NIV, the snorkeling mask demonstrated a better patient-ventilator interaction compared to FFM, as shown by significantly shorter Pressurization Time and Expiratory Trigger Delay (p < 0.01), but no significant differences were found in terms of Inspiratory Trigger Delay and Time of Synchrony between the interfaces tested. At RR 20sim, the snorkeling mask presented the lower DeltaPtrigger (p < 0.01), moreover during all the conditions tested the snorkeling mask showed the longer Pressure Time Product at 200, 300, and 500 ms compared to FFM (p < 0.01). A major limitation of snorkeling mask is that during NIV with this interface it is possible to reach maximum 18 cmH2O of peak inspiratory pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The modified snorkeling mask can be used as an acceptable alternative to other interfaces for both nCPAP and NIV in emergencies.	Prevention
34293520	Serologic Responses following a Single Dose of SARS-Cov-2 Vaccination in Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation Recipients. Immunocompromised individuals were not included in formal trials of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. Subsequent studies in patients with hematologic malignancies and solid organ transplantation recipients suggest inferior responses to vaccination. We determined antibody responses to a single dose of vaccines in one of the most vulnerable patient groups, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) recipients. Pfizer-BioNTech (PB) or AstraZeneca (AZ) SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were administered at least 3 months post-transplantation to 55 adult allo-HCT recipients. We found that older age and concurrent use of immunosuppressive medications were significantly associated with lack of antibody response to vaccination. Only 21% of patients on systemic immunosuppression mounted a response, compared with 58% of patients not on immunosuppression (P = .006). We also show that responses to the AZ vaccine may be superior to responses to the PB vaccine in this cohort. These findings highlight the need for novel immunogenic vaccine formulations and schedules in these highest-risk patients, as well as continued public healthy safety measures to protect the most vulnerable members of our society.

34224947	Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with prediabetes. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to examine the clinical characteristics and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with prediabetes. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 102 COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in India between May and October 2020. RESULTS: Most patients had a poor clinical profile on admission. They had high rates of invasive mechanical ventilation (48%), intensive care unit admission (48%), complications (72.6%), and mortality (32.4%). CONCLUSION: People with prediabetes are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34209708	"Using the Food Stress Index for Emergency Food Assistance: An Australian Case Series Analysis during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Natural Disasters. Food insecurity increases with human and natural disasters. Two tools were developed to assist effective food relief in Western Australia: the Food Stress Index (similar to rental stress, predicts the likelihood of household food insecurity by geographic location) and a basic and nutritious Food Basket Recommendation (that quantifies the types and amounts of food to meet dietary recommendations for different family types). This study aims to understand and compare the processes and impact of using these tools for organisations and their clients involved in emergency food assistance and/or disaster preparedness. A multiple case-study design analysed organisation's use of the tools to assist the response to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and the catastrophic bushfires in Australia. Qualitative interviews were conducted by telephone and Zoom (a cloud-based video conferencing service) in July-August 2020. A purposeful sample of eight interviewees representing seven cases (government, food relief and community organisations involved in emergency food assistance and/or disaster preparedness). Three themes emerged from the analysis, (1) organisations are confident users of the tools; (2) Collaborations were ""Ready to Go"" and (3) Food Stress Index is a ""game changer"". Findings demonstrate the intrinsic value of the tools in the provision of emergency food relief under both normal circumstances and in times of increased need, i.e., COVID-19 pandemic. The study highlights the value and importance of ongoing intersectoral collaborations for food relief and food security (e.g., the Western Australian Food Relief Framework) and suggests that upscaling of the Food Stress Index and food baskets will increase the effectiveness of measures to address food insecurity in Australia."

34340747	NICEdrug.ch, a workflow for rational drug design and systems-level analysis of drug metabolism. The discovery of a drug requires over a decade of intensive research and financial investments - and still has a high risk of failure. To reduce this burden, we developed the NICEdrug.ch resource, which incorporates 250,000 bioactive molecules, and studied their enzymatic metabolic targets, fate, and toxicity. NICEdrug.ch includes a unique fingerprint that identifies reactive similarities between drug-drug and drug-metabolite pairs. We validated the application, scope, and performance of NICEdrug.ch over similar methods in the field on golden standard datasets describing drugs and metabolites sharing reactivity, drug toxicities, and drug targets. We use NICEdrug.ch to evaluate inhibition and toxicity by the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil, and suggest avenues to alleviate its side effects. We propose shikimate 3-phosphate for targeting liver-stage malaria with minimal impact on the human host cell. Finally, NICEdrug.ch suggests over 1300 candidate drugs and food molecules to target COVID-19 and explains their inhibitory mechanism for further experimental screening. The NICEdrug.ch database is accessible online to systematically identify the reactivity of small molecules and druggable enzymes with practical applications in lead discovery and drug repurposing.

34291683	Developing an Innovative System of Open and Flexible, Patient-Family-Centered, Virtual Visiting in ICU During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Collaboration of Staff, Patients, Families, and Technology Companies. Few challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic strike at the very core of our humanity as the inability of family to sit at the bedside of their loved ones when battling for their lives in the ICU. Virtual visiting is one tool to help deal with this challenge. When introducing virtual visiting into our ICU, we identified 5 criteria for a sustainable system that aligned with patient-family-centered care: virtual visiting needed to (1) simulate open and flexible visiting; (2) be able to accommodate differences in family size, dynamics, and cultural practices; (3) utilize a video conferencing platform that is private and secure; (4) be easy to use and not require special teams to facilitate meetings; and (5) not increase the workload of ICU staff. There is a growing body of literature demonstrating a global movement toward virtual visiting in ICU, however there are no publications that describe a system which meet all 5 of our criteria. Importantly, there are no papers describing systems of virtual visiting which mimic open and flexible family presence at the bedside. We were unable to find any off-the-shelf video conferencing platforms that met all our criteria. To come up with a solution, a multidisciplinary team of ICU staff partnered with healthcare technology adoption consultants and two technology companies to develop an innovative system called HowRU. HowRU uses the video conferencing platform Webex with the integration of some newly designed software that automates many of the laborious and complex processes. HowRU is a cloud based, supported, and simplified system that closely simulates open and flexible visiting while ensuring patient and family privacy, dignity, and security. We have demonstrated the transferability of HowRU by implanting it into a second ICU. HowRU is now commercially available internationally. We hope HowRU will improve patient-family-centered care in ICU.	Prevention
34228387	"Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 in a low-prevalence, well-resourced setting, Sydney, Australia. BACKGROUND: The Northern Sydney Local Health District was one of the first health regions to be affected by COVID-19 in Australia. AIM: To describe the clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcomes in our low-prevalence Australian population. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 517 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases between January and June 2020. Patient information was collected as part of routine care within the COVID-19 Virtual Hospital system. Outcomes examined were death, recovery at 30 days and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: The case fatality rate was 1.8%. Multivariate analysis showed factors independently associated with death, composite outcome of death/ICU admission or incomplete recovery at 30 days were age > 80 and presence of 2 or more comorbidities. Most cases acquired COVID-19 through international (50.9%) or cruise ship travel (9.1%). Health care workers comprised 12.8% of the cohort and represented a disproportionately high percentage of the ""unknown"" source group (27.6%). The median incubation period was 5 days (IQR 3-8); one patient had an incubation period of 15 days. Hospitalisation was required in 11.8%, ICU admission in 2.1% and ventilation in 1.4%. A RALE score on CXR of >10 was independently associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: In this low prevalence, well-resourced Australian setting, we report an overall low mortality. Factors associated with adverse patient outcomes on multivariate analysis were age greater than 80 and the presence of 2 or more comorbidities. This data can assist in early risk stratification of COVID-19 patients, and in surge capacity planning for hospitals. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."	Diagnosis;Treatment
34292806	COVID-19 Shelter-In-Place Orders Associated With Delayed Presentation and Deep Venous Thrombosis in Geriatric Hip Fractures. Geriatric hip fractures benefit from timely surgery. At the onset of the corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, shelter-in-place (SIP) orders were mandated in high-risk cities. The authors hypothesized that geriatric patients with hip fractures were more likely to present to the hospital greater than 24 hours after injury during SIP orders. They retrospectively reviewed patients 65 years or older who presented with hip fractures between March 20, 2020, and May 24, 2020 (SIP group), and between March 20, 2019, and May 24, 2019 (historical group). Primary outcomes were incidence of presentation greater than 24 hours after injury and mean number of days between injury and presentation. Secondary outcomes were incidence of preoperative deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and 30- and 90-day mortality rates. Thirty-three patients comprised the SIP group, and 50 patients comprised the historical group. There were no significant differences in their demographics or medical comorbidities. The SIP group was more likely to present greater than 24 hours after injury (P=.05) and presented a greater number of days after injury (P=.02). There was a significant difference in the incidence of preoperative DVT (P=.03). There were no significant differences in 30- and 90-day mortality rates. Geriatric patients who sustained hip fractures during SIP restrictions for COVID-19 were more likely to present greater than 24 hours after injury, have a greater number of days between injury and presentation, and be diagnosed with a preoperative DVT.

34342824	The moderating effect of solar radiation on the association between human mobility and COVID-19 infection in Europe. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic. Some studies have suggested a negative association between sunlight intensity and COVID-19 infection, alluding to the belief that it might be safe to go out on sunny days. This paper examined whether solar radiation mitigated the association between human mobility and COVID-19 infection in Europe using a dynamic panel data model to investigate the effect of human mobility, solar radiation, and their interaction on COVID-19 infection. The results revealed that outgoing mobility was positively correlated and solar radiation was negatively correlated with COVID-19 infection at lag levels of 1, 2, and 3 weeks. The coefficients of the interaction items indicated that solar radiation negatively moderated the relationship between outgoing mobility and the number of daily new confirmed cases at 2- and 3-week lag levels. However, the moderating effect was limited and unable to eliminate the positive effect of outgoing mobility on COVID-19 infection. Thus, these results suggested that solar radiation only weakly mitigated the relationship between human mobility and COVID-19 infection, providing policy implications that mobility should still be restricted on sunny days during the COVID-19 pandemic.

34282805	Placental pathology concerning sudden foetal demise in SARS-CoV-2 positive asymptomatic pregnant female. AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 is responsible for a worldwide increase in morbidity and mortality. The relationship of this infection to mother-to-child vertical transmission has not been elucidated yet. However, recent reports indicate a foetal death rate of up to 3%. METHODS: We report a case of sudden pre-term foetal demise in a woman positive for SARS-CoV-2 but asymptomatic, with physiological course of pregnancy. RESULTS: One of the possible explanations of sudden foetal death may be acute placental insufficiency caused by a SARS-CoV-2 placental infection or the development of foetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS). CONCLUSION: Considering the potential risk of foetal demise, questions remain regarding foetal monitoring and the timing of labour and delivery in the second and third trimesters, particularly in asymptomatic or mild maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. A relevant multidisciplinary team must also be aware of these risks associated with possibly fatal consequences.	Case Report
34352721	Animals, vaccines, and COVID-19. Animals, especially mammals, have played a critical role in the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 virus originated in animals, and the virus can jump back and forth between humans and animals. Moreover, animals have been central to the development of the various vaccines against the virus now employed around the world, continuing a long history. The interrelationships between animals and humans in both disease transmission and its prevention call for an interdisciplinary approach to medicine.	Transmission;Treatment
34198719	SARS-CoV-2 Antigenemia as a Confounding Factor in Immunodiagnostic Assays: A Case Study. Humoral immunity has emerged as a vital immune component against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Nevertheless, a subset of recovered Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) paucisymptomatic/asymptomatic individuals do not generate an antibody response, constituting a paradox. We assumed that immunodiagnostic assays may operate under a competitive format within the context of antigenemia, potentially explaining this phenomenon. We present a case where persistent antigenemia/viremia was documented for at least 73 days post-symptom onset using 'in-house' methodology, and as it progressively declined, seroconversion took place late, around day 55, supporting our hypothesis. Thus, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia/viremia could mask humoral responses, rendering, in certain cases, the phenomenon of 'non-responders' a misnomer.	Case Report
34208610	A Case of COVID-19-Related Thrombocytopenia and Leukopenia in an Adolescent with Mild Symptoms. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been numerous reports and reviews on the complications caused by the disease, analyzing the acute and chronic consequences. The main symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are dry cough, fever, and fatigue. COVID-19 appears to affect all systems, including renal, cardiovascular, circulatory, and respiratory systems, causing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We report on a 14-year-old male adolescent, who presented with thrombocytopenia (platelet count 92 x 10(9) /L) and leukopenia (white blood count 4.2 x 10(3) /muL) that was observed two months ago. Ten days before the first blood test, a viral infection with nasal congestion and runny nose was reported, without other accompanying symptoms. Viral antibodies screening revealed positivity for all the three specific COVID-19 antibodies. Further haematological evaluation with bone marrow aspiration revealed non-specific dysplastic features of the red cell and megakaryocyte progenitors. Although haematological alterations due to COVID-19 infection are available from adult patients' reports, the effect of COVID-19 infection in the pediatric population is underestimated and this is the first case with such haematological involvement. Noteworthy, in the current case, the impact of the COVID-19 infection was not related to the severity of the disease, as the symptoms were mild. In similar cases, bone marrow aspiration would not be performed as a part of routine work-up. Thus, it is important when evaluating pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection to search and report those alterations in order to better understand the impact and the spectrum of clinical manifestations of the specific viral infection in children and adolescents.

34220354	Environmental scan of provincial and territorial planning for COVID-19 vaccination programs in Canada. Background: Public health departments in Canada are currently facing the challenging task of planning and implementing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination programs. Objective: To collect and synthesize information regarding COVID-19 vaccination program planning in each province and territory of Canada, including logistic considerations, priority groups, and vaccine safety and effectiveness monitoring. Methods: Provincial/territorial public health leaders were interviewed via teleconference during the early planning stage of COVID-19 vaccination programs (August-October 2020) to collect information on the following topics: unique factors for COVID-19 vaccination, intention to adopt National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommendations, priority groups for early vaccination, and vaccine safety and effectiveness monitoring. Data were grouped according to common responses and descriptive analysis was performed. Results: Eighteen interviews occurred with 25 participants from 11 of 13 provinces/territories (P/Ts). Factors unique to COVID-19 vaccination included prioritizing groups for early vaccination (n=7), public perception of vaccines (n=6), and differing eligibility criteria (n=5). Almost all P/Ts (n=10) reported reliance on NACI recommendations. Long-term care residents (n=10) and healthcare workers (n=10) were most frequently prioritized for early vaccination, followed by people with chronic medical conditions (n=9) and seniors (n=8). Most P/Ts (n=9) are planning routine adverse event monitoring to assess vaccine safety. Evaluation of effectiveness was anticipated to occur within public health departments (n=3), by researchers (n=3), or based on national guidance (n=4). Conclusion: Plans for COVID-19 vaccination programs in the P/Ts exhibit some similarities and are largely consistent with NACI guidelines, with some discrepancies. Further research is needed to evaluate COVID-19 vaccination programs once implemented.	Prevention
34133005	Viral load and disease severity in COVID-19. The relationship between COVID-19 severity and viral load is unknown. Our objective was to assess the association between viral load and disease severity in COVID-19. In this single center observational study of adults with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2, the first positive in-hospital nasopharyngeal swab was used to calculate the log10 copies/ml [log10 copy number (CN)] of SARS-CoV-2. Four categories based on level of care and modified sequential organ failure assessment score (mSOFA) at time of swab were determined. Median log10CN was compared between different levels of care and mSOFA quartiles. Median log10CN was compared in patients who did and did not receive influenza vaccine, and the correlation between log10CN and D-dimer was examined. We found that of 396 patients, 54.3% were male, and 25% had no major comorbidity. Hospital mortality was 15.7%. Median mSOFA was 2 (IQR 0-3). Median log10CN was 5.5 (IQR 3.3-8.0). Median log10CN was highest in non-intubated ICU patients [6.4 (IQR 4.4-8.1)] and lowest in intubated ICU patients [3.6 (IQR 2.6-6.9)] (p value < 0.01). In adjusted analyses, this difference remained significant [mean difference 1.16 (95% CI 0.18-2.14)]. There was no significant difference in log10CN between other groups in the remaining pairwise comparisons. There was no association between median log10CN and mSOFA in either unadjusted or adjusted analyses or between median log10CN in patients with and without influenza immunization. There was no correlation between log10CN and D-dimer. We conclude, in our cohort, we did not find a clear association between viral load and disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Though viral load was higher in non-intubated ICU patients than in intubated ICU patients there were no other significant differences in viral load by disease severity.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34284976	"Measures of physical performance in COVID-19 patients: a mapping review. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is evidence of short- and long-term impairment of physical performance in patients with COVID-19 infection, but a verification of measures of physical impairment in this condition is lacking. We reviewed the measures used to assess physical performance in these patients. Secondary targets were measures of exercise or daily life activities induced symptoms. METHODS: Medline, CINAHL, and Pedro databases were searched from January 2020 to February 2021 for articles in the English language. Two investigators independently conducted the search, screened all titles and/or abstracts based on the inclusion criteria and independently scored the studies. The quality of the studies was evaluated by two reviewers according to the NIH quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus. RESULTS: Out of 156 potentially relevant articles, 31 observational studies (8 cross-sectional), 1 randomized controlled trial, and 1 protocol were included. The quality of most of the 31 evaluable studies was judged as low (11 studies) or fair (14 studies). Sample sizes of the studies ranged from 14 to 20,889 patients. among the 28 reported measures, Barthel Index (42.4% of studies), Six-Minute Walking Distance Test (36.4%), Short Physical Performance Battery (21.2%) and 1-Minute Sit-to-Stand (12.1%) were the most used. Fifteen% and 36% of studies reported exercise induced desaturation and dyspnoea when performing the assessments, respectively. Other exercise induced symptoms were fatigue and pain. Studies reported wide ranges of impairment in physical performance as compared to ""reference"" values (range of mean or median reported values vs ""reference values"": 11-77 vs 100 points for Barthel Index; 11-22 vs 22-37 repetitions/min for 1m-STS; 0.5-7.9 vs 11.4 +/- 1.3 points for SPPB; and 45-223 vs 380-782 m for 6MWT respectively). CONCLUSION: This review found that a wide variety of functional status tests have been used, making comparisons difficult between studies. These measures show impairment in physical performance in COVID-19 patients. However, the quality of most of the studies was judged as low or fair."	Diagnosis
34208959	Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers in Uganda: A Cross-Sectional Survey. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of COVID-19. However, data on HCWs' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 are limited. Between September and November 2020, we conducted a questionnaire-based COVID-19 KAP survey among HCWs at three hospitals in Uganda. We used Bloom's cut-off of >/=80% to determine sufficient knowledge, good attitude, and good practice, and multivariate Poisson regression with robust variance for statistical analysis. Of 717 HCWs invited to participate, 657 (91.6%) agreed and were enrolled. The mean age (standard deviation) of enrollees was 33.2 (10.2) years; most were clinical HCWs (64.7%) and had advanced secondary school/other higher-level education (57.8%). Overall, 83.9% had sufficient knowledge, 78.4% had a positive attitude, and 37.0% had good practices toward COVID-19. Factors associated with KAP were: Knowledge: being a clinical HCW (aRR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.02-1.23) and previous participation in health research (aRR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.04-1.17); Attitude: age > 35 years (aRR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79-0.98); Practice: being a clinical HCW (aRR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.41-2.59). HCWs in Uganda have good knowledge and positive attitude but poor practices towards COVID-19. Differences in COVID-19 KAP between clinical and non-clinical HCWs could affect uptake of COVID-19 interventions including vaccination.	Prevention
34208937	Cerebral Hemodynamics and Intracranial Compliance Impairment in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Pilot Study. Introduction: One of the possible mechanisms by which the new coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) could induce brain damage is the impairment of cerebrovascular hemodynamics (CVH) and intracranial compliance (ICC) due to the elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP). The main objective of this study was to assess the presence of CVH and ICC alterations in patients with COVID-19 and evaluate their association with short-term clinical outcomes. Methods: Fifty consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients were studied with transcranial Doppler (TCD) and non-invasive monitoring of ICC. Subjects were included upon ICU admission; CVH was evaluated using mean flow velocities in the middle cerebral arteries (mCBFV), pulsatility index (PI), and estimated cerebral perfusion pressure (eCPP), while ICC was assessed by using the P2/P1 ratio of the non-invasive ICP curve. A CVH/ICC score was computed using all these variables. The primary composite outcome was unsuccessful in weaning from respiratory support or death on day 7 (defined as UO). Results: At the first assessment (n = 50), only the P2/P1 ratio (median 1.20 [IQRs 1.00-1.28] vs. 1.00 [0.88-1.16]; p = 0.03) and eICP (14 [11-25] vs. 11 [7-15] mmHg; p = 0.01) were significantly higher among patients with an unfavorable outcome (UO) than others. Patients with UO had a significantly higher CVH/ICC score (9 [8-12] vs. 6 [5-7]; p < 0.001) than those with a favorable outcome; the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for CVH/ICC score to predict UO was 0.86 (95% CIs 0.75-0.97); a score > 8.5 had 63 (46-77)% sensitivity and 87 (62-97)% specificity to predict UO. For those patients undergoing a second assessment (n = 29), after a median of 11 (5-31) days, all measured variables were similar between the two time-points. No differences in the measured variables between ICU non-survivors (n = 30) and survivors were observed. Conclusions: ICC impairment and CVH disturbances are often present in COVID-19 severe illness and could accurately predict an early poor outcome.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34211829	Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cardiac Rehabilitation Delivery around the World. Background: We investigated impacts of COVID-19 on cardiac rehabilitation (CR) delivery around the globe, including virtual delivery, as well as effects on providers and patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a piloted survey was administered to CR programs globally via REDCap from April to June 2020. The 50 members of the International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (ICCPR) and personal contacts facilitated program identification. Results: Overall, 1062 (18.3% program response rate) responses were received from 70/111 (63.1% country response rate) countries in the world with existent CR programs. Of these, 367 (49.1%) programs reported they had stopped CR delivery, and 203 (27.1%) stopped temporarily (mean = 8.3 +/- 2.8 weeks). Alternative models were delivered in 322 (39.7%) programs, primarily through low-tech modes (n = 226,19.3%). Furthermore, 353 (30.2%) respondents were re-deployed, and 276 (37.3%) felt the need to work due to fear of losing their job, despite the perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 (mean = 30.0% +/- 27.4/100). Also, 266 (22.5%) reported anxiety, 241(20.4%) were concerned about exposing their family, 113 (9.7%) reported increased workload to transition to remote delivery, and 105 (9.0%) were juggling caregiving responsibilities during business hours. Patients were often contacting staff regarding grocery shopping for heart-healthy foods (n = 333, 28.4%), how to use technology to interact with the program (n = 329, 27.9%), having to stop their exercise because they have no place to exercise (n = 303, 25.7%), and their risk of death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing cardiovascular disease (n = 249, 21.2%). Respondents perceived staff (n = 488, 41.3%) and patient (n = 453, 38.6%) personal protective equipment, as well as COVID-19 screening (n = 414, 35.2%), and testing (n = 411, 35.0%) as paramount to in-person service resumption. Conclusion: Given the estimated number of CR programs globally, these results suggest approximately 4400 CR programs globally have ceased or temporarily stopped service delivery. Those that remain open are implementing new technologies to ensure their patients receive CR safely, despite the challenges. Highlights: - COVID-19 has impacted cardiac rehabilitation (CR) delivery around the globe.- In this cross-sectional study, a survey was completed by 1062 (18.3%) CR programs from 70 (63.1%) countries.- The pandemic has resulted in at least temporary cessation of ~75% of CR programs, with others ceasing initiation of new patients, reducing components delivered, and/or changing of mode delivery with little opportunity for planning and training.- There is also significant psychosocial and economic impact on CR providers.- Alternative CR model (e.g., home-based, virtual) reimbursement advocacy is needed, to ensure safe, accessible secondary prevention delivery.

34219035	Influence of polish national COVID-19 lockdown on the patient characteristics and outcomes of bariatric surgery at a high-volume center-A cohort study. INTRODUCTION: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the health care systems around the world have been overburdened resulting in significant reduction of planned surgical procedures such as bariatric surgeries. The primary aim of this study is to assess the influence of the COVID-19 national lockdown in Poland on the short-term outcomes and intraoperative course of bariatric patients in a high volume IFSO certified bariatric center. MATERIAL & METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 158 bariatric surgery patients, who underwent bariatric procedures either prior to or after the first national lockdown in Poland. The patients were categorized as pre-lockdown group and the post-lockdown group, each comprising of 79 patients. RESULTS: The post-lockdown group had significantly lower operative weight (105.76 vs 114.25, p = 0.012) and BMI (36.99 vs 39.93, p = 0.005) compared to pre-lockdown group. The primary length of stay was significantly longer in the post-lockdown group (3.04 vs 2.44, p = 0.001). The post-lockdown group had significantly lower mean CCI score (1.90 vs 6.67, p = 0.046) and less short-term readmissions post-discharge (0 vs 8.86, p = 0.007) than pre-lockdown group. CONCLUSION: The post-lockdown group was found to have lower body weight and BMI on the day of the operation than those operated prior to the lockdown. These findings are conflicting to previous research assessing weight changes during lockdowns. Since the qualification criteria and order of operations were similar and pre-defined for both groups, possible explanations for these findings are higher patient motivation due to COVID-19 fears and longer preparation period due to elective surgery postponement. We encourage bariatric centers globally to assess the effect of national lockdowns on the patient profiles as well as the psychological and behavioral impact on the bariatric cohort.	Prevention
34131331	Molecular determinants of disease severity in urinary tract infection. The most common and lethal bacterial pathogens have co-evolved with the host. Pathogens are the aggressors, and the host immune system is responsible for the defence. However, immune responses can also become destructive, and excessive innate immune activation is a major cause of infection-associated morbidity, exemplified by symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are caused, in part, by excessive innate immune activation. Severe kidney infections (acute pyelonephritis) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and painful infections of the urinary bladder (acute cystitis) can become debilitating in susceptible patients. Disease severity is controlled at specific innate immune checkpoints, and a detailed understanding of their functions is crucial for strategies to counter microbial aggression with novel treatment and prevention measures. One approach is the use of bacterial molecules that reprogramme the innate immune system, accelerating or inhibiting disease processes. A very different outcome is asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined by low host immune responsiveness to bacteria with attenuated virulence. This observation provides the rationale for immunomodulation as a new therapeutic tool to deliberately modify host susceptibility, control the host response and avoid severe disease. The power of innate immunity as an arbitrator of health and disease is also highly relevant for emerging pathogens, including the current COVID-19 pandemic.	Mechanism;Treatment
34346471	Simulating drug concentrations in PDMS microfluidic organ chips. Microfluidic organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) cell culture devices are often fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) because it is biocompatible, transparent, elastomeric, and oxygen permeable; however, hydrophobic small molecules can absorb to PDMS, which makes it challenging to predict drug responses. Here, we describe a combined simulation and experimental approach to predict the spatial and temporal concentration profile of a drug under continuous dosing in a PDMS Organ Chip containing two parallel channels separated by a porous membrane that is lined with cultured cells, without prior knowledge of its log P value. First, a three-dimensional finite element model of drug loss into the chip was developed that incorporates absorption, adsorption, convection, and diffusion, which simulates changes in drug levels over time and space as a function of potential PDMS diffusion coefficients and log P values. By then experimentally measuring the diffusivity of the compound in PDMS and determining its partition coefficient through mass spectrometric analysis of the drug concentration in the channel outflow, it is possible to estimate the effective log P range of the compound. The diffusion and partition coefficients were experimentally derived for the antimalarial drug and potential SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic, amodiaquine, and incorporated into the model to quantitatively estimate the drug-specific concentration profile over time measured in human lung airway chips lined with bronchial epithelium interfaced with pulmonary microvascular endothelium. The same strategy can be applied to any device geometry, surface treatment, or in vitro microfluidic model to simulate the spatial and temporal gradient of a drug in 3D without prior knowledge of the partition coefficient or the rate of diffusion in PDMS. Thus, this approach may expand the use of PDMS Organ Chip devices for various forms of drug testing.	Treatment
34199995	Asian-Origin Approved COVID-19 Vaccines and Current Status of COVID-19 Vaccination Program in Asia: A Critical Analysis. COVID-19 vaccination has started throughout the globe. The vaccination program has also begun in most Asian countries. This paper analyzed the Asian-origin COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination program status in Asia till March 2021 under three sections. In the first section, we mapped the approved vaccines that originated from Asia, their technological platforms, collaborations during vaccine development, and regulatory approval from other countries. We found that a total of eight Asian COVID-19 vaccines originated and got approval from three countries: China, India, and Russia. In the second section, we critically evaluated the recent progress of COVID-19 vaccination programs. We analyzed the overall vaccination status across the Asian region. We also calculated the cumulative COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in different Asian countries, vaccine rolling in 7-day average in various Asian countries, and COVID-19 vaccine per day doses administrated in several Asian countries. We found that China and India vaccinated the maximum number of people. Finally, we evaluated the factors affecting the COVID-19 vaccination program in Asia, such as vaccine hesitancy, basic reproduction numbers (R0) and vaccination campaigns, and the cost of the vaccines. Our analysis will assist the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program successfully in Asia.	Treatment
34292414	Emergency teleradiological activity is an epidemiological estimator and predictor of the covid-19 pandemic in mainland France. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for real-time monitoring of diseases evolution to rapidly adapt restrictive measures. This prospective multicentric study aimed at investigating radiological markers of COVID-19-related emergency activity as global estimators of pandemic evolution in France. We incorporated two sources of data from March to November 2020: an open-source epidemiological dataset, collecting daily hospitalisations, intensive care unit admissions, hospital deaths and discharges, and a teleradiology dataset corresponding to the weekly number of CT-scans performed in 65 emergency centres and interpreted remotely. CT-scans specifically requested for COVID-19 suspicion were monitored. Teleradiological and epidemiological time series were aligned. Their relationships were estimated through a cross-correlation function, and their extremes and breakpoints were compared. Dynamic linear models were trained to forecast the weekly hospitalisations based on teleradiological activity predictors. RESULTS: A total of 100,018 CT-scans were included over 36 weeks, and 19,133 (19%) performed within the COVID-19 workflow. Concomitantly, 227,677 hospitalisations were reported. Teleradiological and epidemiological time series were almost perfectly superimposed (cross-correlation coefficients at lag 0: 0.90-0.92). Maximal number of COVID-19 CT-scans was reached the week of 2020-03-23 (1 086 CT-scans), 1 week before the highest hospitalisations (23,542 patients). The best valid forecasting model combined the number of COVID-19 CT-scans and the number of hospitalisations during the prior two weeks and provided the lowest mean absolute percentage (5.09%, testing period: 2020-11-02 to 2020-11-29). CONCLUSION: Monitoring COVID-19 CT-scan activity in emergencies accurately and instantly predicts hospitalisations and helps adjust medical resources, paving the way for complementary public health indicators.

34206057	Autophagy, Unfolded Protein Response, and Neuropilin-1 Cross-Talk in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: What Can Be Learned from Other Coronaviruses. The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 virus. This severe acute respiratory syndrome is currently a global health emergency and needs much effort to generate an urgent practical treatment to reduce COVID-19 complications and mortality in humans. Viral infection activates various cellular responses in infected cells, including cellular stress responses such as unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, following the inhibition of mTOR. Both UPR and autophagy mechanisms are involved in cellular and tissue homeostasis, apoptosis, innate immunity modulation, and clearance of pathogens such as viral particles. However, during an evolutionary arms race, viruses gain the ability to subvert autophagy and UPR for their benefit. SARS-CoV-2 can enter host cells through binding to cell surface receptors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1). ACE2 blockage increases autophagy through mTOR inhibition, leading to gastrointestinal complications during SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. NRP1 is also regulated by the mTOR pathway. An increased NRP1 can enhance the susceptibility of immune system dendritic cells (DCs) to SARS-CoV-2 and induce cytokine storm, which is related to high COVID-19 mortality. Therefore, signaling pathways such as mTOR, UPR, and autophagy may be potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19. Hence, extensive investigations are required to confirm these potentials. Since there is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19 infection, we sought to review and discuss the important roles of autophagy, UPR, and mTOR mechanisms in the regulation of cellular responses to coronavirus infection to help identify new antiviral modalities against SARS-CoV-2 virus.

34223137	Antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infection in patients with suspected and proven COVID-19: results from an antibiotic point prevalence survey in Scottish hospitals. Background: Bacterial co-infection is infrequently observed with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection outside of critical care, however, antibiotics are commonly prescribed. Objectives: To examine factors associated with antibiotic prescribing for suspected respiratory tract infection (RTI) and evaluate the nature and dynamics of prescribing in hospitalized patients with suspected and proven COVID-19 infection. Methods: An antibiotic point prevalence survey in hospitalized adult patients was conducted in designated COVID-19 clinical areas (including critical care) in 15 Scottish hospitals. Antibiotics prescribed for RTI and factors associated with prescribing were investigated. Results: Of 820 surveyed patients, 272 (prevalence 33.3%) received antibiotics for suspected RTI on the survey day and 58.8% were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Antibiotics were empirical in 91.9% and amoxicillin (24.6%), doxycycline (20.5%) and co-amoxiclav (15%) were most frequently prescribed. Oral antibiotics were prescribed in 54.5% and duration was recorded in 76.7% on wards for a median of 5 days. IV to oral switch occurred after a median of 2 days. Prescribing for RTI was independently and positively associated with COPD/chronic lung disease, purulent/bloody sputum, abnormal chest X-ray, and CRP >/= 100 mg/L. Probable and definite hospital-acquired COVID-19 and diabetes were associated with a lower odds of receiving an antibiotic for RTI. Conclusions: Antibiotic prescribing for suspected RTI was commonly observed and predominantly empirical in suspected or proven COVID-19. Initiatives to reinforce stewardship principles including clinical review, effective use of microbiological diagnostics and better understanding of the role of biomarkers are central to further limit unnecessary antibiotic therapy in COVID-19.

34290826	Insights into the management of anorectal disease in the coronavirus 2019 disease era. Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) has created major impacts on public health. The virus has plagued a large population requiring hospitalization and resource utilization. Knowledge about the COVID-19 virus continues to grow. It can commonly present with gastrointestinal symptoms; initially, this was considered an atypical presentation, which led to delays in care. The pandemic has posed serious threats to the care of anorectal diseases. Urgent surgeries have been delayed, and the care of cancer patients and cancer screenings disrupted. This had added to patient discomfort and the adverse outcomes on healthcare will continue into the future. The better availability of personal protective equipment to providers and standard checklist protocols in operating rooms can help minimize healthcare-related spread of the virus. Telehealth, outpatient procedures, and biochemical tumor marker tests can help with mitigation of anorectal-disease-related problems. There is limited literature about the clinical management of anorectal diseases during the pandemic. We performed a detailed literature review to guide clinicians around management options for anorectal disease patients. We also highlighted the health challenges seen during the pandemic.	Prevention
34214752	New quinoline-triazole conjugates: Synthesis, and antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. At present therapeutic options for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are very limited. We designed and synthesized three sets of small molecules using quinoline scaffolds. A series of quinoline conjugates (10a-l, 11a-c, and 12a-e) by incorporating 1,2,3-triazole were synthesized via a modified microwave-assisted click chemistry technique. Among the synthesized conjugates, 4-((1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy)-6-fluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl )quinoline (10g) and 6-fluoro-4-(2-(1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)ethoxy)-2-(trifluorometh yl)quinoline (12c) show high potency against SARS-CoV-2. The selectivity index (SI) of compounds 10g and 12c also indicates the significant efficacy compared to the reference drugs.	Mechanism;Treatment
34351882	Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 Infections, Including COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Infections, Associated with Large Public Gatherings - Barnstable County, Massachusetts, July 2021. During July 2021, 469 cases of COVID-19 associated with multiple summer events and large public gatherings in a town in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, were identified among Massachusetts residents; vaccination coverage among eligible Massachusetts residents was 69%. Approximately three quarters (346; 74%) of cases occurred in fully vaccinated persons (those who had completed a 2-dose course of mRNA vaccine [Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna] or had received a single dose of Janssen [Johnson & Johnson] vaccine >/=14 days before exposure). Genomic sequencing of specimens from 133 patients identified the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in 119 (89%) and the Delta AY.3 sublineage in one (1%). Overall, 274 (79%) vaccinated patients with breakthrough infection were symptomatic. Among five COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized, four were fully vaccinated; no deaths were reported. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values in specimens from 127 vaccinated persons with breakthrough cases were similar to those from 84 persons who were unvaccinated, not fully vaccinated, or whose vaccination status was unknown (median = 22.77 and 21.54, respectively). The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible (1); vaccination is the most important strategy to prevent severe illness and death. On July 27, CDC recommended that all persons, including those who are fully vaccinated, should wear masks in indoor public settings in areas where COVID-19 transmission is high or substantial.* Findings from this investigation suggest that even jurisdictions without substantial or high COVID-19 transmission might consider expanding prevention strategies, including masking in indoor public settings regardless of vaccination status, given the potential risk of infection during attendance at large public gatherings that include travelers from many areas with differing levels of transmission.

34285445	COULD COVID-19 BE A HEMOGLOBINOPATHY? The world is struggling to deal with the corona pandemic. Effective therapies are still awaited due to the lack of understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease. Bearing recent research and clinical observations in mind, the authors propose a novel physiological mechanism of COVID-19 and explain development of COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 related hemoglobinopathy. It is a consistent observation that the radiological picture of COVID-19 related ARDS bears more resemblance to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) than typical ARDS. There has been great controversy regarding this proposed similarity. The main argument from those objecting to this comparison is that the etiology is hypoxia in case of HAPE and inflammation in COVID-19 related ARDS. We propose that considering the recent bioinformatics prediction models, COVID-19 might first infect red blood cells via CD147 and cause hemoglobin damage. The resulting hypoxemia may cause pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction leading to HAPE-like lung lesions. The now introduced alveolar hypoxia further exaggerates hemoglobinopathy hypoxemia leading to a vicious cycle. In this review, the authors recommend laboratory experiments to prove these hypotheses. The proposed physiological mechanism has significant therapeutic implications. If proven, the authors suggest the use of exchange transfusion as adjunct therapy and development of anti-CD147 drugs.

34202032	Direct Measurement of B Lymphocyte Gene Expression Biomarkers in Peripheral Blood Transcriptomics Enables Early Prediction of Vaccine Seroconversion. Peripheral blood transcriptome is a highly promising area for biomarker development. However, transcript abundances (TA) in these cell mixture samples are confounded by proportions of the component leukocyte subpopulations. This poses a challenge to clinical applications, as the cell of origin of any change in TA is not known without prior cell separation procedure. We developed a framework to develop a cell-type informative TA biomarkers which enable determination of TA of a single cell-type (B lymphocytes) directly in cell mixture samples of peripheral blood (e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC) without the need for subpopulation separation. It is applicable to a panel of genes called B cell informative genes. Then a ratio of two B cell informative genes (a target gene and a stably expressed reference gene) obtained in PBMC was used as a new biomarker to represent the target gene expression in purified B lymphocytes. This approach, which eliminates the tedious procedure of cell separation and directly determines TA of a leukocyte subpopulation in peripheral blood samples, is called the Direct LS-TA method. This method is applied to gene expression datasets collected in influenza vaccination trials as early predictive biomarkers of seroconversion. By using TNFRSF17 or TXNDC5 as the target genes and TNFRSF13C or FCRLA as the reference genes, the Direct LS-TA B cell biomarkers were determined directly in the PBMC transcriptome data and were highly correlated with TA of the corresponding target genes in purified B lymphocytes. Vaccination responders had almost a 2-fold higher Direct LS-TA biomarker level of TNFRSF17 (log 2 SMD = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.47-1.21) on day 7 after vaccination. The sensitivity of these Direct LS-TA biomarkers in the prediction of seroconversion was greater than 0.7 and area-under curves (AUC) were over 0.8 in many datasets. In this paper, we report a straightforward approach to directly estimate B lymphocyte gene expression in PBMC, which could be used in a routine clinical setting. Moreover, the method enables the practice of precision medicine in the prediction of vaccination response. More importantly, seroconversion could now be predicted as early as day 7. As the acquired immunology pathway is common to vaccination against influenza and COVID-19, these biomarkers could also be useful to predict seroconversion for the new COVID-19 vaccines.

34212497	Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 is well preserved and symptom dependent in kidney transplant recipients. Data on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in kidney transplant recipients are scarce. Thus, we conducted a single-center observational study to assess the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence in outpatient kidney transplant recipients (KTR; n = 1037) and healthcare workers (HCW; n = 512) during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in fall 2020 and evaluated the clinical variables affecting antibody levels. Antibodies against S1 and S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated using immunochemiluminescent assay (cut off 9.5 AU/ml, sensitivity of 91.2% and specificity of 90.2%). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence was lower in KTR than in HCW (7% vs. 11.9%, p = .001). Kidney transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were younger (p = .001) and received CNI-based immunosuppression more frequently (p = .029) than seronegative KTR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive symptomatic KTR had a higher BMI (p = .04) than asymptomatic KTR. Interestingly, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were higher in KTR than in HCW (median 31 AU/ml, IQR 17-84 vs. median 15 AU/ml, IQR 11-39, p < .001). The presence of moderate to severe symptoms in KTR was found to be the only independent factor affecting IgG levels (Beta coefficient = 41.99, 95% CI 9.92-74.06, p = .011) in the multivariable model. In conclusion, KTR exhibit a well-preserved symptom-dependent humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34341947	Characteristics of immune and inflammatory responses among different age groups of pediatric patients with COVID-19 in China. BACKGROUND: Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among pediatric patients are more common in children less than 1 year of age. Our aim is to address the underlying role of immunity and inflammation conditions among different age groups of pediatric patients. METHODS: We recruited pediatric patients confirmed of moderate COVID-19 symptoms, admitted to Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 28th to April 1st in 2020. Patients were divided into four age groups (</= 1, 1-6, 7-10, and 11-15 years). Demographic information, clinical characteristics, laboratory results of lymphocyte subsets test, immune and inflammation related markers were all evaluated. RESULTS: Analysis included 217/241 (90.0%) of patients with moderate clinical stage disease. Average recovery time of children more than 6 years old was significantly shorter than of children younger than 6 years (P = 0.001). Reduced neutrophils and increased lymphocytes were significantly most observed among patients under 1 year old (P < 0.01). CD19+ B cells were the only significantly elevated immune cells, especially among patients under 1 year old (cell proportion: n = 12, 30.0%, P < 0.001; cell count: n = 13, 32.5%, P < 0.001). While, low levels of immune related makers, such as immunoglobulin (Ig) G (P < 0.001), IgA (P < 0.001), IgM (P < 0.001) and serum complement C3c (P < 0.001), were also mostly found among patients under 1 year old, together with elevated levels of inflammation related markers, such as tumor necrosis factor gamma (P = 0.007), interleukin (IL)-10 (P = 0.011), IL-6 (P = 0.008), lactate dehydrogenase (P < 0.001), and procalcitonin (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: The higher rate of severe cases and long course of COVID-19 among children under 1 year old may be due to the lower production of antibodies and serum complements of in this age group.

34210624	Computed tomography at every step: Long coronavirus disease. BACKGROUND: Some patients continue to experience symptoms related to Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) after the acute phase of infection. Imaging studies, especially computed tomography (CT) of the chest, have gained importance since the beginning of the pandemic. CT can help diagnose COVID-19, assess the extent of pulmonary involvement, and predict the disease severity. We aimed to define the frequency of persistent symptoms and correlate their presence with the results of laboratory findings and the severity of the disease based on the findings of chest CT. METHODS: We examined patients discharged from the hospital after treatment for COVID-19 and whose nasopharyngeal swab sample tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 after at least 4 weeks from the initial diagnosis. The patients were asked about the presence of persisting symptoms. In addition to the demographic data, laboratory results and severity levels seen on the chest CT were recorded. RESULTS: In all, 116 patients were included in the study, of which 61 reported at least one persisting symptom (52.5%). The mean age of the study population was 48.90 +/- 17.74 years. The persistent symptoms included shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, muscle weakness, dizziness, headache, fatigue, and palpitations. The mean CT severity score was 3.80 +/- 0.38 and it was lower in patients without any persistent symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of C-reactive protein and fibrinogen, anemia, and female sex were associated with some of the persistent symptoms., the severity of the disease seen on CT was a successful predictor for the disease severity/prognosis and was also correlated with prolonged COVID infection and more persistent symptoms.

34283141	A Vision-Based Social Distancing and Critical Density Detection System for COVID-19. Social distancing (SD) is an effective measure to prevent the spread of the infectious Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, a lack of spatial awareness may cause unintentional violations of this new measure. Against this backdrop, we propose an active surveillance system to slow the spread of COVID-19 by warning individuals in a region-of-interest. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce a vision-based real-time system that can detect SD violations and send non-intrusive audio-visual cues using state-of-the-art deep-learning models. Second, we define a novel critical social density value and show that the chance of SD violation occurrence can be held near zero if the pedestrian density is kept under this value. The proposed system is also ethically fair: it does not record data nor target individuals, and no human supervisor is present during the operation. The proposed system was evaluated across real-world datasets.	Prevention
34368662	Effect of co-infection with intestinal parasites on COVID-19 severity: A prospective observational cohort study. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection results in a spectrum of clinical presentations. Evidence from Africa indicates that significantly less COVID-19 patients suffer from serious symptoms than in the industrialized world. We and others previously postulated a partial explanation for this phenomenon, being a different, more activated immune system due to parasite infections. Here, we aimed to test this hypothesis by investigating a potential correlation of co-infection with parasites with COVID-19 severity in an endemic area in Africa. Methods: Ethiopian COVID-19 patients were enrolled and screened for intestinal parasites, between July 2020 and March 2021. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe COVID-19. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between parasite infection, and COVID-19 severity. Models were adjusted for sex, age, residence, education level, occupation, body mass index, and comorbidities. Findings: 751 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were enrolled, of whom 284 (37.8%) had intestinal parasitic infection. Only 27/255 (10.6%) severe COVID-19 patients were co-infected with intestinal parasites, while 257/496 (51.8%) non-severe COVID-19 patients were parasite positive (p<0.0001). Patients co-infected with parasites had lower odds of developing severe COVID-19, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.23 (95% CI 0.17-0.30; p<0.0001) for all parasites, aOR 0.37 ([95% CI 0.26-0.51]; p<0.0001) for protozoa, and aOR 0.26 ([95% CI 0.19-0.35]; p<0.0001) for helminths. When stratified by species, co-infection with Entamoeba spp., Hymenolepis nana, Schistosoma mansoni, and Trichuris trichiura implied lower probability of developing severe COVID-19. There were 11 deaths (1.5%), and all were among patients without parasites (p = 0.009). Interpretation: Parasite co-infection is associated with a reduced risk of severe COVID-19 in African patients. Parasite-driven immunomodulatory responses may mute hyper-inflammation associated with severe COVID-19.

34205217	Efficacy of Tocilizumab Therapy in Different Subtypes of COVID-19 Cytokine Storm Syndrome. BACKGROUND: Cytokine storm in COVID-19 is heterogenous. There are at least three subtypes: cytokine release syndrome (CRS), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and sepsis. METHODS: A retrospective study comprising 276 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. All patients were tested for ferritin, interleukin-6, D-Dimer, fibrinogen, calcitonin, and C-reactive protein. According to the diagnostic criteria, three groups of patients with different subtypes of cytokine storm syndrome were identified: MAS, CRS or sepsis. In the MAS and CRS groups, treatment results were assessed depending on whether or not tocilizumab was used. RESULTS: MAS was diagnosed in 9.1% of the patients examined, CRS in 81.8%, and sepsis in 9.1%. Median serum ferritin in patients with MAS was significantly higher (5894 vs. 984 vs. 957 ng/mL, p < 0.001) than in those with CRS or sepsis. Hypofibrinogenemia and pancytopenia were also observed in MAS patients. In CRS patients, a higher mortality rate was observed among those who received tocilizumab, 21 vs. 10 patients (p = 0.043), RR = 2.1 (95% CI 1.0-4.3). In MAS patients, tocilizumab decreased the mortality, 13 vs. 6 patients (p = 0.013), RR = 0.50 (95% CI 0.25-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab therapy in patients with COVID-19 and CRS was associated with increased mortality, while in MAS patients, it contributed to reduced mortality.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34210325	Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal, blood, urine, and stool samples of patients with COVID-19: a hospital-based longitudinal study. BACKGROUND: The persistence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in the body fluids of patients with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may increase the potential risk of viral transmission. There is still uncertainty on whether the recommended quarantine duration is sufficient to reduce the risk of transmission. This study aimed to investigate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal, blood, urine, and stool samples of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this hospital-based longitudinal study, 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were recruited between March 2020 and August 2020 in Guilan Province, north of Iran. Nasopharyngeal, blood, urine, and stool samples were obtained from each participant at the time of hospital admission, upon discharge, 1 week after discharge, and every 2 weeks until all samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. A survival analysis was also performed to identify the duration of viral persistence. RESULTS: The median duration of viral RNA persistence in the nasopharyngeal samples was 8 days from the first positive RT-PCR result upon admission (95% CI 6.91-9.09); the maximum duration of viral shedding was 25 days from admission. Positive blood, urine, and stool RT-PCR results were detected in 24%, 7%, and 6% of the patients, respectively. The median duration of viral persistence in the blood, urine, and stool samples was 7 days (95% CI 6.07-7.93), 6 days (95% CI 4.16-8.41), and 13 days (95% CI 6.96-19.4), respectively. Also, the maximum duration of viral persistence in the blood, urine, and stool samples was 17, 11, and 42 days from admission, respectively. CONCLUSION: According to the present results, immediately after the hospitalized patients were discharged, no evidence of viral genetic materials was found. Therefore, appropriate treatments were selected for the patients at this hospital. However, we recommend further investigations on a larger sample size in multi-center and prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effects of different drugs on the shedding of the virus through body secretions.

34208271	Exercise Ventilatory Inefficiency in Post-COVID-19 Syndrome: Insights from a Prospective Evaluation. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a systemic disease characterized by a disproportionate inflammatory response in the acute phase. This study sought to identify clinical sequelae and their potential mechanism. METHODS: We conducted a prospective single-center study (NCT04689490) of previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without dyspnea during mid-term follow-up. An outpatient group was also evaluated. They underwent serial testing with a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), transthoracic echocardiogram, pulmonary lung test, six-minute walking test, serum biomarker analysis, and quality of life questionaries. RESULTS: Patients with dyspnea (n = 41, 58.6%), compared with asymptomatic patients (n = 29, 41.4%), had a higher proportion of females (73.2 vs. 51.7%; p = 0.065) with comparable age and prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. There were no significant differences in the transthoracic echocardiogram and pulmonary function test. Patients who complained of persistent dyspnea had a significant decline in predicted peak VO2 consumption (77.8 (64-92.5) vs. 99 (88-105); p < 0.00; p < 0.001), total distance in the six-minute walking test (535 (467-600) vs. 611 (550-650) meters; p = 0.001), and quality of life (KCCQ-23 60.1 +/- 18.6 vs. 82.8 +/- 11.3; p < 0.001). Additionally, abnormalities in CPET were suggestive of an impaired ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 slope 32 (28.1-37.4) vs. 29.4 (26.9-31.4); p = 0.022) and high PETCO2 (34.5 (32-39) vs. 38 (36-40); p = 0.025). INTERPRETATION: In this study, >50% of COVID-19 survivors present a symptomatic functional impairment irrespective of age or prior hospitalization. Our findings suggest a potential ventilation/perfusion mismatch or hyperventilation syndrome.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34285872	Is Atrial Fibrillation a Risk Factor for Worse Outcomes in Severe COVID-19 Patients: A Single Center Retrospective Cohort. Introduction: New onset atrial fibrillation leads to worse outcomes in patients with sepsis. The association between new onset atrial fibrillation (AF) in COVID19 patients with COVID19 outcomes are lacking. This study aims to determine whether new onset atrial fibrillation in COVID19 patients admitted in the ICU is a risk factor for death or requirement of mechanical ventilation (MV). Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted in a cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to Bahrain Defence Force COVID19 Field ICU between April 2020 to November 2020. Data were extracted from the electronic medical records. The patients who developed new onset AF during admission were compared to patients who remained in sinus rhythm. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to control for confounders and estimate the effect of AF on the outcomes of these patients. Results: Our study included a total of 492 patients out of which 30 were diagnosed with new onset AF. In the AF group, the primary outcome occurred in 66.7% of patients (n = 20). In the control group, 17.1% (n = 79) developed the primary outcome. Upon adjusting for the confounders in the multivariate regression model, AF had an odds ratio of 3.96 (95% CI: 1.05-14.98; p = 0.042) for the primary outcome. Conclusion: Our results indicate that new onset AF is a risk factor for worse outcomes in patients admitted with COVID19 in the ICU.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34221909	Increased Adherence to Infection Control Practices Among Medical Laboratory Technicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Self-Reported Survey Study. Background: The adherence of medical laboratory technicians (MLT) to infection control guidelines is essential for reducing the risk of exposure to infectious agents. This study explored the adherence of MLT towards infection control practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: The study population consisted of MLT (n = 444) who worked in private and government health sectors in Jordan. A self-reported survey was used to collect data from participants. Findings: More than 87% of the participants reported adherence to hand-washing guidelines and using personal protective equipment (PPE) when interacting with patients (74.5%), and handling clinical samples (70.0%). Besides, 88.1%, 48.2%, and 7.7% reported wearing of lab coats, face masks, and goggles, at all times, respectively. The majority reported increased adherence to infection control practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes increased PPE use at the workplace (94.2%), increased frequency of disinfection of laboratory surfaces (92.4%) and laboratory equipment (86.7%), and increased frequency of handwashing/use of antiseptics (94.6%). Having a graduate degree was significantly associated with increased adherence of participants to the daily use of goggles/eye protection (p = 0.002), and the use of PPE while handling clinical samples (p = 0.011). Having work experience of >10 years was associated with increased adherence to the use of PPE while handling clinical samples (p = 0.001). Conclusion: MLT reported very good adherence with most assessed infection control practices. In addition, they reported increased conformity with infection control guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic.	Prevention
34286836	Unintended consequences of COVID-19 social distancing among older adults with kidney disease. BACKGROUND: While social distancing policies protect older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from exposure to COVID-19, reduced social interaction may also have unintended consequences. METHODS: To identify subgroups of patients at risk for unintended health consequences of social distancing, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from a national cohort study of older Veterans with advanced CKD (n=223). Characteristics included activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs (IADLs), cognition score, depression score, social support, financial stress, symptom burden, and number of chronic conditions. Unintended consequences of social distancing included restricted Life Space mobility, low willingness for video telehealth, reduced in-person contact with caregivers, and food insecurity. We identified subgroups of patients at risk of unintended consequences using model-based recursive partitioning (MoB). RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 77.9 years, 64.6% were white, and 96.9% were male. Overall, 22.4% of participants had restricted Life Space, 33.9% reported low willingness for video telehealth, 19.0% reported reduced caregiver contact, and 3.2% reported food insecurity. For Life Space restriction, four subgroups partitioned (i.e., split) by IADL difficulty, cognition score, and ADL difficulty were identified. The highest rate of restricted Life Space was 54.7% in the subgroup of participants with >3 IADL difficulties For low willingness for telehealth and reduced caregiver contact, separate models identified two subgroups split by cognition score and depression score, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Measures of function, cognition, and depressive symptoms may identify older adults with advanced CKD who are at higher risk for unintended health consequences of social distancing.

34208620	Impact of COVID-19 Mitigation Measures on Mosquito-Borne Diseases in 2020 in Queensland, Australia. We describe the impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on mosquito-borne diseases in Queensland, Australia, during the first half of 2020. Implementation of restrictions coincided with an atypical late season outbreak of Ross River virus (RRV) characterized by a peak in notifications in April (1173) and May (955) which were greater than 3-fold the mean observed for the previous four years. We propose that limitations on human movement likely resulted in the majority of RRV infections being acquired at or near the place of residence, and that an increase in outdoor activities, such as gardening and bushwalking in the local household vicinity, increased risk of exposure to RRV-infected mosquitoes. In contrast, the precipitous decline in international passenger flights led to a reduction in the number of imported dengue and malaria cases of over 70% and 60%, respectively, compared with the previous five years. This substantial reduction in flights also reduced a risk pathway for importation of exotic mosquitoes, but the risk posed by importation via sea cargo was not affected. Overall, the emergence of COVID-19 has had a varied impact on mosquito-borne disease epidemiology in Queensland, but the need for mosquito surveillance and control, together with encouragement of personal protective measures, remains unchanged.

34368070	Strategies for COVID-19 Epidemiological Surveillance in India: Overall Policies Till June 2021. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has gripped the entire world, almost paralysing the human race in its entirety. The virus rapidly transmits via human-to-human medium resulting in a massive increase of patients with COVID-19. In order to curb the spread of the disease, an immediate action of complete lockdown was implemented across the globe. India with a population of over 1.3 billion was not an exception and took the challenge to execute phase-wise lockdown, unlock and partial lockdown activities. In this study, we intend to summarise these different phases that the Government of India (GoI) imposed to fight against SARS-CoV-2 so that it can act as a reference guideline to help controlling future waves of COVID-19 and similar pandemic situations in India.

34335018	Assessing the Spatio-temporal Spread of COVID-19 via Compartmental Models with Diffusion in Italy, USA, and Brazil. The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 has led to a surge in interest in the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. Such models are usually defined as compartmental models, in which the population under study is divided into compartments based on qualitative characteristics, with different assumptions about the nature and rate of transfer across compartments. Though most commonly formulated as ordinary differential equation models, in which the compartments depend only on time, recent works have also focused on partial differential equation (PDE) models, incorporating the variation of an epidemic in space. Such research on PDE models within a Susceptible, Infected, Exposed, Recovered, and Deceased framework has led to promising results in reproducing COVID-19 contagion dynamics. In this paper, we assess the robustness of this modeling framework by considering different geometries over more extended periods than in other similar studies. We first validate our code by reproducing previously shown results for Lombardy, Italy. We then focus on the U.S. state of Georgia and on the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro, one of the most impacted areas in the world. Our results show good agreement with real-world epidemiological data in both time and space for all regions across major areas and across three different continents, suggesting that the modeling approach is both valid and robust.

34221776	Clinical Puzzles and Decision-Making in Antisynthetase Syndrome. We present a challenging clinical case of an antisynthetase syndrome (ASS) with a four-year follow-up. The disease debuted with skin manifestations and interstitial lung disease (ILD), then the severe Raynaud's phenomenon came to the fore with the development of occlusive vasculopathy and critical digital ischemia. After the relief of vascular lesions, the severity of the condition was determined by ILD. The use of combined pulse therapy with cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone, treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin made it possible to reduce the activity of ASS: lung lesion and the progression of vasculopathy. However, after the termination of an unplanned pregnancy, the patient again experienced an exacerbation with ILD progression. It was decided to use rituximab, against which the patient's condition was stabilized. Clinical and laboratory remission was achieved, which was maintained for a year and a half. However, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic triggered a re-exacerbation of the pulmonary domain of the disease, which forced us to use a nintedanib with a positive clinical and instrumental effect.

34131815	Description and preliminary experience with Virtual Visit Assessment (ViVA) during the COVID-19 pandemic, a structured virtual management protocol for patients with multiple sclerosis. In people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), strict follow-up is essential. Telemedicine has the potential to overcome many of the difficulties in routine management. Herein, we present a structured protocol that can be used to remotely manage patients with MS, describing in detail the steps to be taken and exams needed at each stage. A working group was established which developed a tailored protocol that can be adapted to a variety of settings. The overall protocol consisted of 5 phases: enrolment, document sharing phase, pre-evaluation, virtual visit, and post-visit phase, which was divided into 14 individual steps. As of October 2020, 25 virtual visits have been carried out, all via Skype. The patient's caregiver was present during visits and had an active role. The average duration of the virtual visit was 24 min, and that of the pre-visit and post-visit were around 15 min each. Overall satisfaction as rated by physicians was considered high (8.0 +/- 0.5). Using the system usability scale (SUS), patients also favorably rated the virtual visit (96.6 +/- 6.1). In 20% of cases, the virtual visit was not sufficient to provide adequate information and an in-person clinical visit was recommended. The described protocol has the potential to provide benefits for the healthcare system as well as patients and their caregivers both during and beyond COVID-19 pandemic.	Prevention
34223812	"Series of cases of acute acquired comitant esotropia in children associated with excessive online classes on smartphone during COVID-19 pandemic; digital eye strain among kids (DESK) study-3. Extra time of sitting in front of a digital device is required for e-learning by children during Corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic which can lead to many ocular problems including digital eye strain (DES). In view of increased incidence of DES in children, multiple studies had been conducted in central India to assess the eye strain in children due to excessive online classes as a research project named ""Digital eye strain among kids (DESK) study."" This study DESK-3 aimed to report series of cases of acute acquired comitant esotropia (AACE) in children attending online classes during COVID-19 pandemic. Children aged 6-18 years with recent onset of esotropia of < 1-month duration without any similar history in past presented in month of July-August 2020 at a tertiary children eye care hospital were evaluated. Data collection included age and gender of child, presence or absence of diplopia, visual acuity, duration of smartphone use, duration of online classes, angle of deviation for near and distance and cycloplegic refraction. Total eight children of AACE were included in the study. The mean age of children was 12.5 +/- 4.2 years. All eight were males. The mean duration of smartphone use was 4.6 + 0.7 hours per day. All children were attending online classes > 4 hours per day on smartphone of average size 5.5 inches. Five children were emmetropic, one myopic, one pseudomyopic and one hyperopic. The angle of deviation for near and distance were 48.1 +/- 16.4 PD and 49.3 +/- 15.9 PD respectively with normal ocular motility. Seven children complained of horizontal diplopia in all gazes. Neurological examination and CT scan of brain and orbit was normal in all patients. Two months before the lockdown only one case was identified as compared to eight during the lockdown. Prolonged near work during smart phone use for e-learning might lead to the development of AACE in children."	Prevention
34226832	X-ray and CT-scan-based automated detection and classification of covid-19 using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Covid-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is the most recent coronavirus-related disease that has been announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Furthermore, it has brought the whole planet to a halt as a result of the worldwide introduction of lockdown and killed millions of people. While this virus has a low fatality rate, the problem is that it is highly infectious, and as a result, it has infected a large number of people, putting a strain on the healthcare system, hence, Covid-19 identification in patients has become critical. The goal of this research is to use X-rays images and computed tomography (CT) images to introduce a deep learning strategy based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect and identify the Covid-19 disease. We have implemented two different classifications using CNN, i.e., binary and multiclass classification. A total of 3,877 images dataset of CT and X-ray images has been utilised to train the model in binary classification, out of which the 1,917 images are of Covid-19 infected individuals . An overall accuracy of 99.64%, recall (or sensitivity) of 99.58%, the precision of 99.56%, F1-score of 99.59%, and ROC of 100% has been observed for the binary classification. For multiple classifications, the model has been trained using a total of 6,077 images, out of which 1,917 images are of Covid-19 infected people, 1,960 images are of normal healthy people, and 2,200 images are of pneumonia infected people. An accuracy of 98.28%, recall (or sensitivity) of 98.25%, the precision of 98.22%, F1-score of 98.23%, and ROC of 99.87% has been achieved for the multiclass classification using the proposed method. On the currently available dataset, the our proposed model produced the desired results, and it can assist healthcare workers in quickly detecting Covid-19 positive patients.	Diagnosis
34202114	Coinfections with Bacteria, Fungi, and Respiratory Viruses in Patients with SARS-CoV-2: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. BACKGROUND: Coinfection with bacteria, fungi, and respiratory viruses in SARS-CoV-2 is of particular importance due to the possibility of increased morbidity and mortality. In this meta-analysis, we calculated the prevalence of such coinfections. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched from 1 December 2019 to 31 March 2021. Effect sizes of prevalence were pooled with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To minimize heterogeneity, we performed sub-group analyses. RESULTS: Of the 6189 papers that were identified, 72 articles were included in the systematic review (40 case series and 32 cohort studies) and 68 articles (38 case series and 30 cohort studies) were included in the meta-analysis. Of the 31,953 SARS-CoV-2 patients included in the meta-analysis, the overall pooled proportion who had a laboratory-confirmed bacterial infection was 15.9% (95% CI 13.6-18.2, n = 1940, 49 studies, I(2) = 99%, p < 0.00001), while 3.7% (95% CI 2.6-4.8, n = 177, 16 studies, I(2) = 93%, p < 0.00001) had fungal infections and 6.6% (95% CI 5.5-7.6, n = 737, 44 studies, I(2) = 96%, p < 0.00001) had other respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 patients in the ICU had higher co-infections compared to ICU and non-ICU patients as follows: bacterial (22.2%, 95% CI 16.1-28.4, I(2) = 88% versus 14.8%, 95% CI 12.4-17.3, I(2) = 99%), and fungal (9.6%, 95% CI 6.8-12.4, I(2) = 74% versus 2.7%, 95% CI 0.0-3.8, I(2) = 95%); however, there was an identical other respiratory viral co-infection proportion between all SARS-CoV-2 patients [(ICU and non-ICU) and the ICU only] (6.6%, 95% CI 0.0-11.3, I(2) = 58% versus 6.6%, 95% CI 5.5-7.7, I(2) = 96%). Funnel plots for possible publication bias for the pooled effect sizes of the prevalence of coinfections was asymmetrical on visual inspection, and Egger's tests confirmed asymmetry (p values < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Bacterial co-infection is relatively high in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2, with little evidence of S. aureus playing a major role. Knowledge of the prevalence and type of co-infections in SARS-CoV-2 patients may have diagnostic and management implications.	Diagnosis
34291033	Risk Diagrams Based on Primary Care Electronic Medical Records and Linked Real-Time PCR Data to Monitor Local COVID-19 Outbreaks During the Summer 2020: A Prospective Study Including 7,671,862 People in Catalonia. Monitoring transmission is a prerequisite for containing COVID-19. We report on effective potential growth (EPG) as a novel measure for the early identification of local outbreaks based on primary care electronic medical records (EMR) and PCR-confirmed cases. Secondly, we studied whether increasing EPG precedes local hospital and intensive care (ICU) admissions and mortality. Population-based cohort including all Catalan citizens' PCR tests, hospitalization, intensive care (ICU) and mortality between 1/07/2020 and 13/09/2020; linked EMR covering 88.6% of the Catalan population was obtained. Nursing home residents were excluded. COVID-19 counts were ascertained based on EMR and PCRs separately. Weekly empirical propagation (rho7) and 14-day cumulative incidence (A14) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated at care management area (CMA) level, and combined as EPG = rho7 x A14. Overall, 7,607,201 and 6,798,994 people in 43 CMAs were included for PCR and EMR measures, respectively. A14, rho7, and EPG increased in numerous CMAs during summer 2020. EMR identified 2.70-fold more cases than PCRs, with similar trends, a median (interquartile range) 2 (1) days earlier, and better precision. Upticks in EPG preceded increases in local hospital admissions, ICU occupancy, and mortality. Increasing EPG identified localized outbreaks in Catalonia, and preceded local hospital and ICU admissions and subsequent mortality. EMRs provided similar estimates to PCR, but some days earlier and with better precision. EPG is a useful tool for the monitoring of community transmission and for the early identification of COVID-19 local outbreaks.	Diagnosis;Prevention;Transmission
34198933	Scaffold Hopping of alpha-Rubromycin Enables Direct Access to FDA-Approved Cromoglicic Acid as a SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro) Inhibitor. The COVID-19 pandemic is still active around the globe despite the newly introduced vaccines. Hence, finding effective medications or repurposing available ones could offer great help during this serious situation. During our anti-COVID-19 investigation of microbial natural products (MNPs), we came across alpha-rubromycin, an antibiotic derived from Streptomyces collinus ATCC19743, which was able to suppress the catalytic activity (IC50 = 5.4 microM and Ki = 3.22 microM) of one of the viral key enzymes (i.e., M(Pro)). However, it showed high cytotoxicity toward normal human fibroblasts (CC50 = 16.7 microM). To reduce the cytotoxicity of this microbial metabolite, we utilized a number of in silico tools (ensemble docking, molecular dynamics simulation, binding free energy calculation) to propose a novel scaffold having the main pharmacophoric features to inhibit M(Pro) with better drug-like properties and reduced/minimal toxicity. Nevertheless, reaching this novel scaffold synthetically is a time-consuming process, particularly at this critical time. Instead, this scaffold was used as a template to explore similar molecules among the FDA-approved medications that share its main pharmacophoric features with the aid of pharmacophore-based virtual screening software. As a result, cromoglicic acid (aka cromolyn) was found to be the best hit, which, upon in vitro M(Pro) testing, was 4.5 times more potent (IC50 = 1.1 microM and Ki = 0.68 microM) than alpha-rubromycin, with minimal cytotoxicity toward normal human fibroblasts (CC50 > 100 microM). This report highlights the potential of MNPs in providing unprecedented scaffolds with a wide range of therapeutic efficacy. It also revealed the importance of cheminformatics tools in speeding up the drug discovery process, which is extremely important in such a critical situation.	Mechanism;Treatment
34227154	Accelerated stability study of the ester prodrug remdesivir: Recently FDA-approved Covid-19 antiviral using reversed-phase-HPLC with fluorimetric and diode array detection. Remdesivir (RDV) is the first antiviral drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration, to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. RDV is a relatively new chemical entity, 'ester prodrug', with no reported stability profile. Due to the urgency of its use and thus fast production, it is important to develop a stability-indicating method for its assay. Chromatographic separation was carried out on a C18 column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) with dual detection: diode array at 240 nm and fluorescence at lambdaex/em 245/390 nm. Isocratic elution of acetonitrile and distilled water (acidified with phosphoric acid, pH 4) in the ratio of 55:45 (v/v), respectively, was used. The linearity range using HPLC-diode array detection was 0.1-15 mug/mL, whereas that using fluorimetric detection was 0.05-15 mug/mL. As per the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines, RDV has been degraded by accelerated alkaline, acidic, neutral hydrolysis, oxidative, heat, and photolytic stress conditions. Possible degradation hypothesis of the parent molecule has been suggested and illustrated. The proposed methods have achieved selective determination of the intact drug with no peaks overlapping in all assumptions. Extensive degradation confirms threatened drug stability at thermal and basic hydrolytic stressing. The developed methods were fully validated and proved suitable for quality control routine analysis of RDV in raw material and pharmaceutical dosage forms.	Treatment
34340203	Mammographic and sonographic findings in the breast and axillary tail following a COVID-19 vaccine. Axillary lymphadenopathy on breast imaging after recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination has been reported in the literature as immunization has become more widespread. While muscle edema at the injection site has been observed on MRI secondary to an immune response, ipsilateral breast imaging observations of edema have not been reported to be seen with the COVID-19 vaccinations to date. Mammographic findings such as trabecular and skin thickening, along with increased echogenicity on ultrasound, can be seen with edema secondary to capillary leak or poor lymphatic drainage, and should be considered as a possible etiology for the observed breast edema following a recent COVID-19 vaccine. Inflammatory changes observed in the breast and axillary tail post vaccination described in this case series are transient, but clinically relevant for patients who experience swelling following injection. Similar to evaluations for suspected mastitis, a short interval imaging follow up to confirm resolution may be appropriate for patients with ipsilateral vaccination histories, and could potentially reduce the number of false positive examinations in this clinical scenario. However, inflammatory breast cancer can mimic inflammation and infection, therefore close follow up to resolution is critical as to not miss cancer.	Case Report
34217143	Daily glucose variation influenced by the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients treated in Lima-Peru. AIM: The pandemic has generated the need for COVID-19 patients to be treated as best as possible; however, the effect of these treatments on glycemic control has not yet been taken into account. This article aims to determine whether the daily variation of glucose is influenced by the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients treated in Lima-Peru. METHODOLOGY: A prospective cohort study was undertook, in which glucose was measured four times a day in 53 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. These values were associated with the use of corticosteroids and adjusted for other socio-educational variables, all by means of PA-GEE models. RESULTS: Nested multivariate analysis of daily glucose variation found that those using corticosteroids increased the daily average glucose as well as the first and last glucose measurements, this is, at 6am and 10pm, respectively (all p-values <0.026). An increase in glucose levels was also observed in those with diabetes (all p-values <0.001). In contrast, we found that there was a decrease in the last glucose measurement of the day in obese patients (p-value = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: The patients who used corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 increased the average glucose per day, especially in the first and last measurement.	Treatment
34335605	High-Density Blood Transcriptomics Reveals Precision Immune Signatures of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Hospitalized Individuals. The immune response to COVID-19 infection is variable. How COVID-19 influences clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients needs to be understood through readily obtainable biological materials, such as blood. We hypothesized that a high-density analysis of host (and pathogen) blood RNA in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 would provide mechanistic insights into the heterogeneity of response amongst COVID-19 patients when combined with advanced multidimensional bioinformatics for RNA. We enrolled 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (11 died) and 15 controls, collecting 74 blood PAXgene RNA tubes at multiple timepoints, one early and in 23 patients after treatment with various therapies. Total RNAseq was performed at high-density, with >160 million paired-end, 150 base pair reads per sample, representing the most sequenced bases per sample for any publicly deposited blood PAXgene tube study. There are 770 genes significantly altered in the blood of COVID-19 patients associated with antiviral defense, mitotic cell cycle, type I interferon signaling, and severe viral infections. Immune genes activated include those associated with neutrophil mechanisms, secretory granules, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), along with decreased gene expression in lymphocytes and clonal expansion of the acquired immune response. Therapies such as convalescent serum and dexamethasone reduced many of the blood expression signatures of COVID-19. Severely ill or deceased patients are marked by various secondary infections, unique gene patterns, dysregulated innate response, and peripheral organ damage not otherwise found in the cohort. High-density transcriptomic data offers shared gene expression signatures, providing unique insights into the immune system and individualized signatures of patients that could be used to understand the patient's clinical condition. Whole blood transcriptomics provides patient-level insights for immune activation, immune repertoire, and secondary infections that can further guide precision treatment.

34212349	Rescue medical activities among sea migrants and refugees in the Mediterranean region: lessons to be learned from the 2014-2020 period. BACKGROUND: Since 2014, the number of migrants and refugees crossing the Mediterranean towards Europe has risen significantly due to various reasons. Both state agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have launched rescue missions in the Central Mediterranean in accordance with international legal obligations for search and rescue (SAR) operations for those under distress at sea. Our aim is to summarise the specific qualifications needed for maritime SAR in the Mediterranean both in terms of the population at risk, the equipment and the medical support required, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the operational legal framework. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article aims to summarise the key points of SAR efforts from a medical perspective as depicted in the relevant literature during a specific timeline period (2014-2020) in a specific part of the Mediterranean Sea (Central Mediterranean route). Only papers published in English and whose full text was available were included in this study. The inclusion criteria were: a) articles referring to sea rescue operations between 2014 and 2020, b) research that focused on medical preparedness and assistance during rescue operations in the Central Mediterranean route, c) studies concerning demographic and clinical features of the rescue population, d) guidelines on the rule of conduct of persons and states participating in rescue activities. The exclusion criteria were: a) studies describing SAR operations in different regions of the world and b) studies focusing on routes, demographics and medical support of migrants/refugees on land. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: a) characteristics of the population in distress at sea: country of origin, age groups, presence of communicable and non-communicable diseases were identified in the relevant literature. Our research shows that dermatological and respiratory issues were the major concerns among sea migrants, coming from different countries of both Africa and Asia, being relatively young and mostly males; b) medical preparedness and equipment needed for rescue: according to current guidelines, revised during the COVID-19 pandemic, infrastructure needed during SAR operations includes both equipment for resuscitation, personal protective equipment, deck adjustments, medical personnel trained to function in an austere setting and able to handle vulnerable patient groups such as children and pregnant women; c) medico-legal implications of SAR operations: knowledge of the legal framework encompassing SAR operations seems necessary, as European Union and state led initiatives seem to withdraw from proactive SAR, while criminalising NGO led rescue efforts. Operating with the imperative to save lives seems to be the only way of respecting international law and human values, thus, a summary of what the law dictates was made in an effort to keep medical workers participating in such operations updated. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation aims to shed light on the special clinical features of sea migrants, the skills, equipment and organizational structure needed by medical workers participating in SAR operations as well as the legal framework under which they will be asked to operate. Special consideration will be given to the difficulties that emerged due to the COVD-19 pandemic.	Prevention

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibit mild to moderate symptoms, whereas 15% of COVID-19 cases progress to pneumonia, some associated cutaneous findings are also reported as maculopapular eruptions, morbilliform rashes, urticaria, chickenpox-like lesions, and livedo reticularis. The inactivated COVID-19 vaccines are authorized for use in some countries including Turkey. Here, we report an unusual case of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation in a 68-year-old male patient who was vaccinated against COVID-19. The patient presented to family medicine clinic with a stinging sensation and pain radiating from the right side of his chest to his back. Physical examination revealed multiple pinheaded vesicular lesions upon an erythematous base occupying an area on his right mammary region and back corresponding to T3-T5 dermatomes. He reported that he got his second dose of COVID-19 vaccine 5 days ago. As COVID 19 decreases the cell-mediated immunity, it could also increase the risk of herpes zoster (HZ). Although the exact reason remains unsolved, vaccine-induced immunomodulation caused by live attenuated vaccines and attenuated alloreactivity caused by inactivated vaccines may be responsible mechanisms for the reactivation of HZ. Epidemiological studies are needed to clarify the possible connection between vaccination and reactivation of herpesvirus infections.	Case Report
34198454	"Track the dynamical features for mutant variants of COVID-19 in the UK. AIMS: The main purpose of this study is to explore whether the new variant SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 in the UK is equipped with some leading or underlying features. METHODS: We apply a systematic and persuasive approach to reveal the underlying dynamical features of this variant. The approach utilises extracting the main features, which consist of 3-valued features, via the time-series data for new cases, 28-day deaths and 60-day deaths. The experimental samples chosen rely on the the rolling sets of regional data vectors whose dimensions are all 7 days. These data sets are projected onto the 3-valued features to yield the vector rejections. Then the minimal features are thus extracted by the minimal total norms. Then we map out the traces of the similarities between all the extracted time-varying features. RESULTS: Our findings, no matter in preliminary or follow-up study, clearly show there is no consistent and substantial shift in the 3-valued features even after the occurrence of this new variant - this might validate the efficacy of the current vaccines against this variant. CONCLUSIONS: Since the underlying features of the mutant is unchanged, and the leading feature of B1.1.7 is not yet present, it might help us make the lockdown decision ""choose the lesser of the two evils: pandemic and economic woes"", and validate vaccine developments or adopt preventive measures."

34132382	The kidnapping of mitochondrial function associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to multi-organ failure associated with a cytokine storm and septic shock. The virus evades the mitochondrial production of interferons through its N protein and, from that moment on, it hijacks the functions of these organelles. The aim of this study was to show how the virus kidnaps the mitochondrial machinery for its benefit and survival, leading to alterations of serum parameters and to nitrosative stress (NSS). In a prospective cohort of 15 postmortem patients who died from COVID-19, six markers of mitochondrial function (COX II, COX IV, MnSOD, nitrotyrosine, Bcl-2 and caspase-9) were analyzed by the immune colloidal gold technique in samples from the lung, heart, and liver. Biometric laboratory results from these patients showed alterations in hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, urea nitrogen, glucose, C-reactive protein, albumin, D-dimer, ferritin, fibrinogen, Ca(2)(+), K(+), lactate and troponin. These changes were associated with alterations in the mitochondrial structure and function. The multi-organ dysfunction present in COVID-19 patients may be caused, in part, by damage to the mitochondria that results in an inflammatory state that contributes to NSS, which activates the sepsis cascade and results in increased mortality in COVID-19 patients.

34225463	"20-Week Study of Clinical Outcomes of Over-the-Counter COVID-19 Prophylaxis and Treatment. OBJECTIVES AND SETTING.: As the lethal COVID-19 pandemic enters its second year, the need for effective modalities of alleviation remains urgent. This includes modalities that can readily be used by the public to reduce disease spread and severity. Such preventive measures and early-stage treatments may temper the immediacy of demand for advanced anti-COVID measures (drugs, antibodies, vaccines) and help relieve strain also on other health system resources. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS.: We present results of a clinical study with a multi-component OTC ""core formulation"" regimen used in a multiply exposed adult population. Analysis of clinical outcome data from our sample of over 100 subjects - comprised of roughly equal sized regimen-compliant (test) and non-compliant (control) groups meeting equivalent inclusion criteria - demonstrates a strong statistical significance in favor of use of the core formulations. RESULTS.: While both groups were moderate in size, the difference between them in outcomes over the 20-week study period was large and stark: Just under 4% of the compliant test group presented flu-like symptoms, but none of the test group was COVID-positive; whereas 20% of the non-compliant control group presented flu-like symptoms, three-quarters of whom (15% overall of the control group) were COVID-positive. CONCLUSIONS.: Offering a low cost, readily implemented anti-viral approach, the study regimen may serve, at the least, as a stopgap modality and, perhaps, as a useful tool in combatting the pandemic."

34290872	Unprovoked serotonin syndrome-like presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection: A small case series. Clinicians and researchers have reported an array of neurological abnormalities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and while serotonin excess has been observed we are unaware of reports of central nervous system serotonin toxicity in COVID-19. We present two cases that resemble serotonin syndrome in COVID-19, but without identifiable inciting medications. A 54-year-old with multiple sclerosis and diabetes mellitus presented with altered mental status. His altered sensorium was attributed to diabetic ketoacidosis, but his condition quickly deteriorated with fever to 105 degrees Fahrenheit, rigidity in all extremities, inducible clonus, and hyperreflexia. He was intubated and was treated for possible meningitis and seizure. Neurologic workup was negative for acute pathology. Despite acetaminophen, his core temperature remained elevated to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. He was treated with external cooling and cyproheptadine and within 48 h, his fever, rigidity, hyperreflexia, and clonus resolved. He was extubated and discharged home on day 14. A 72-year-old with hyperlipidemia was admitted with tremors, 4 days after testing positive for COVID-19. His symptoms rapidly worsened, and he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on day 3 in extremis, febrile to 104.4 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 180 beats per minute, and apparent whole body myoclonus. He was intubated and developed fever refractory to acetaminophen requiring external cooling. Extensive neurologic workup was negative. He received cyproheptadine and slowly improved. He was extubated and discharged to rehab on day 11. These cases represent a unique presentation in COVID-19 that must be considered and requires a high index of suspicion.	Case Report
34200791	"Potential Improvement in Rehabilitation Quality of 2019 Novel Coronavirus by Isometric Training System; Is There ""Muscle-Lung Cross-Talk""? The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis is now present in more than 200 countries. It started in December 2019 and has, so far, led to more than 149, 470,968 cases, 3,152,121 deaths, and 127,133,013 survivors recovered by 28 April 2021. COVID-19 has a high morbidity, and mortality of 2%, on average, whereas most people are treated after a period of time. Some people who recover from COVID-19 are left with 20 to 30% decreased lung function. In this context, exercise focused on skeletal muscle with minimal lung involvement could potentially play an important role. Regular exercise protects against diseases associated with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. This long-term effect of exercise may be ascribed to the anti-inflammatory response elicited by an acute bout of exercise, which is partly mediated by muscle-derived myokines. The isometric training system seems to have this feature, because this system is involved with the skeletal muscle as the target tissue. However, no studies have examined the effect of exercise on the treatment and recovery of COVID-19, and, more importantly, ""muscle-lung cross-talk"" as a mechanism for COVID-19 treatment. It is suggested that this theoretical construct be examined by researchers."	Treatment
34215611	India's pragmatic vaccination strategy against COVID-19: a mathematical modelling-based analysis. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of targeted vaccination strategies on morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19, as well as on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2, in India. DESIGN: Mathematical modelling. SETTINGS: Indian epidemic of COVID-19 and vulnerable population. DATA SOURCES: Country-specific and age-segregated pattern of social contact, case fatality rate and demographic data obtained from peer-reviewed literature and public domain. MODEL: An age-structured dynamical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in India incorporating uncertainty in natural history parameters was constructed. INTERVENTIONS: Comparison of different vaccine strategies by targeting priority groups such as keyworkers including healthcare professionals, individuals with comorbidities (24-60 years old) and all above 60. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence reduction and averted deaths in different scenarios, assuming that the current restrictions are fully lifted as vaccination is implemented. RESULTS: The priority groups together account for about 18% of India's population. An infection-preventing vaccine with 60% efficacy covering all these groups would reduce peak symptomatic incidence by 20.6% (95% uncertainty intervals (UI) 16.7-25.4) and cumulative mortality by 29.7% (95% CrI 25.8-33.8). A similar vaccine with ability to prevent symptoms (but not infection) will reduce peak incidence of symptomatic cases by 10.4% (95% CrI 8.4-13.0) and cumulative mortality by 32.9% (95% CrI 28.6-37.3). In the event of insufficient vaccine supply to cover all priority groups, model projections suggest that after keyworkers, vaccine strategy should prioritise all who are >60 and subsequently individuals with comorbidities. In settings with weakest transmission, such as sparsely populated rural areas, those with comorbidities should be prioritised after keyworkers. CONCLUSIONS: An appropriately targeted vaccination strategy would witness substantial mitigation of impact of COVID-19 in a country like India with wide heterogeneity. 'Smart vaccination', based on public health considerations, rather than mass vaccination, appears prudent.	Prevention
34356644	COVID-19 Vaccines and Thrombosis-Roadblock or Dead-End Street? Two adenovirus-based vaccines, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S, and two mRNA-based vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA.1273, have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and are invaluable in preventing and reducing the incidence of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Recent reports have pointed to thrombosis with associated thrombocytopenia as an adverse effect occurring at a low frequency in some individuals after vaccination. The causes of such events may be related to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions with different C-type lectin receptors, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and the CD147 receptor, or to different soluble splice variants of the spike protein, adenovirus vector interactions with the CD46 receptor or platelet factor 4 antibodies. Similar findings have been reported for several viral diseases after vaccine administration. In addition, immunological mechanisms elicited by viral vectors related to cellular delivery could play a relevant role in individuals with certain genetic backgrounds. Although rare, the potential COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) requires immediate validation, especially in risk groups, such as the elderly, chronic smokers, and individuals with pre-existing incidences of thrombocytopenia; and if necessary, a reformulation of existing vaccines.

34224534	Nursing Interventions Increase Influenza Vaccination Quality Measures for Home Telehealth Patients. BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccinations are a preventive health quality measure. Home telehealth nursing staff interventions can reduce influenza disease burden and complications. PURPOSE: To improve seasonal flu vaccine rates using novel home telehealth clinical and technology interventions. METHODS: A pre- and postintervention concurrent cohort study for 513 outpatients was conducted. Interventions included automated 2-way patient messaging using remote monitoring equipment, a new note template to record vaccination status in the electronic health record, and flu vaccine patient education. RESULTS: Interventions resulted in vaccination rates of 70.4% for Veterans ages 19 to 65 years, and 81.7% for Veterans 66 years and older, exceeding national, regional, and local Veterans Administration targets. CONCLUSIONS: Two-way messaging and standardized documentation increased rates. Declinations persisted despite education. Reasons included fear of side effects, and rarely leaving home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nursing interventions can increase influenza vaccination quality measures for primary care home telehealth patients.	Prevention
34219126	Editorial: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Pregnancy Outcomes from Current Global Study Data. During the global COVID-19 pandemic, data from clinical studies, systematic review, and population registry data have shown that when compared with non-pregnant women, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is associated with a small increase in risk to the mother. Large cohort studies and registry data collected from 2020 have included the US Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET), COVI-PREG, the UK and Global Pregnancy and Neonatal Outcomes in COVID-19 (PAN-COVID) study, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine (SONPM) National Perinatal COVID-19 Registry, the Swedish Pregnancy Register, and the Canadian Surveillance of COVID-19 in Pregnancy (CANCOVID-Preg) registry. Recently published data have shown that most maternal infections with SARS-CoV-2 occur during the third trimester and result in a small increase in hospital admission, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, preterm birth, and increased cesarean sections in mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, currently approved vaccines given in pregnancy result in an immune response to current SARS-CoV-2 variants. Transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to the fetus can occur, but the immediate and long-term effects on the newborn infant remain unclear. Therefore, women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy should be managed according to current clinical guidelines with timely vaccination to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2. This Editorial summarizes what is currently known about maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and pregnancy outcomes from multinational studies.	Diagnosis;Transmission;Treatment
34206062	Incidence of Reported Flu-Like Syndrome Cases in Brazilian Health Care Workers in 2020 (March to June). Health care workers (HCWs) are at an increased risk of being exposed to COVID-19. This study aimed to characterize flu-like syndrome cases (FS) in HCWs notified in Brazil and compare them with FS cases in the general community (GC). In the Brazilian protocol, FS corresponds to a suspected case of COVID-19. The manuscript analyzed cases of FS in five Brazilian states, estimating the incidence rates of cases of FS and clinical and epidemiological characteristics. Registered cases (March to June 2020) totaled about 1,100,000 cases of FS. HCWs represented 17% of the registers, whose incidence was 20.41/100 vs. 2.15/100 in the GC. FS cases in HCWs concentrated the highest percentages in the age group of 30 to 49 years (65.15%) and among the nursing staff (46.86%). This study was the first interstate evaluation in Brazil to estimate suspected cases of FS by COVID-19 in HCWs. In order to control the spread of viral respiratory infections in HCWs, including COVID-19, it is necessary to review the management of health information to identify who they are, how many they are, and to what situations these workers are most frequently exposed, as well as in what professions they have. This information can guide specific, practical, and far-reaching actions.	Prevention
34216297	COVID-19 and Myositis: What We Know So Far. PURPOSE: Myositis as a rare manifestation of COVID-19 is only recently being reported. This review examines the current literature on COVID-19-induced myositis focusing on etiopathogenesis, clinical presentations, diagnostic practices, and therapeutic challenges with immunosuppression, and the difficulties experienced by rheumatologists in established myositis in the COVID-19 era. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 is associated with a viral myositis attributable to direct myocyte invasion or induction of autoimmunity. COVID-19-induced myositis may be varied in presentation, from typical dermatomyositis to rhabdomyolysis, and a paraspinal affliction with back pain. It may or may not present with acute exponential elevations of enzyme markers such as creatine kinase (CK). Virus-mediated muscle inflammation is attributed to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme) receptor-mediated direct entry and affliction of muscle fibers, leading on to innate and adaptive immune activation. A greater recognition of the stark similarity between anti-MDA5-positive myositis with COVID-19 has thrown researchers into the alley of exploration - finding common etiopathogenic basis as well as therapeutic strategies. For patients with established myositis, chronic care was disrupted during the pandemic with several logistic challenges and treatment dilemmas leading to high flare rates. Teleconsultation bridged the gap while ushering in an era of patient-led care with the digital transition to tools of remote disease assessment. COVID-19 has brought along greater insight into unique manifestations of COVID-19-related myositis, ranging from direct virus-induced muscle disease to triggered autoimmunity and other etiopathogenic links to explore. A remarkable shift in the means of delivering chronic care has led patients and caregivers worldwide to embrace a virtual shift with teleconsultation and opened doorways to a new era of patient-led care.

34286203	Adaptation of a respiratory service to provide CPAP for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, outside of a critical care setting, in a district general hospital. Introduction: One-hundred and forty patients at Croydon University Hospital received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on a specialist respiratory ward, as a bridge to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or as a ceiling of care for COVID-19. This retrospective study aimed to outline service expansion, patient characteristics and explore risk factors in outcomes. Results: Mean age of patients on CPAP was 64 years (standard deviation 12). The median number of days from admission to CPAP initiation was 1 day (interquartile range (IQR) 0-3), and time before successful wean off CPAP was 4 days (IQR 2-6). Twenty-eight-day mortality was 64%. Thirty-four per cent of patients went onto require IMV, 24% improved off CPAP and 41% were palliated. The 28-day non-survivor group were of older age, had statistically significant higher admission creatinine and higher peak oxygen requirement. Age above 65 years was associated with higher mortality (odds ratio 5.9; 95% confidence interval 2.63-13.3). Conclusion: CPAP is a viable ceiling-of-treatment option in those unsuitable for ventilation, and may even avoid the need for ventilation in others. Duration on CPAP may be useful for service provision to predict resource allocation. The rapidity from admission to CPAP initiation highlights the need for early ceilings of care to be established.

34224187	COVID-19 and ischemic stroke. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients had documented thrombotic complications and ischemic stroke. Several mechanisms related to immune-mediated thrombosis, the renin angiotensin system and the effect of SARS-CoV-2 in cardiac and brain tissue may contribute to the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19. Simultaneously, significant strains on global healthcare delivery, including ischemic stroke management, have made treatment of stroke in the setting of COVID-19 particularly challenging. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on epidemiology, clinical manifestation, and pathophysiology of ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19 to bridge the gap from bench to bedside and clinical practice during the most challenging global health crisis of the last decades.

34209801	ISIDOG Consensus Guidelines on COVID-19 Vaccination for Women before, during and after Pregnancy. INTRODUCTION: Sars-CoV-2 infection poses particular problems in pregnancy, as the infection more frequently causes severe complications than in unaffected pregnant women or nonpregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Now that vaccination is available and rapidly being implemented worldwide, the question arises whether pregnant women should be vaccinated, and if so, whether they should receive priority. METHODS: Available scientific data and available guidelines about vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 were collected by the Guideline Committee of the International Society of Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISIDOG) and were analyzed, discussed and summarized as guidelines for healthcare workers caring for pregnant women. Concluding statements were graded according to the Oxford evidence-based medicine grading system. RESULTS: There is evidence to consider pregnancy as a risk factor for serious complications of COVID-19 infection, even in the absence of additional risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity which increase these risks even more in pregnancy. Currently available data slightly favor mRNA-based vaccines above vector-based vaccines during pregnancy and breastfeeding, until more safety data become available. CONCLUSION: ISIDOG advises policy makers and societies to prioritize pregnant women to receive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and favor the mRNA vaccines until further safety information becomes available.

34292183	Implications of Frailty in COVID-19. As the global coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to cause higher mortality and hospitalization rates among older adults, strategies such as frailty screening have been suggested for resource allocation and clinical management. Frailty is a physiologic condition characterized by a decreased reserve to stressors and is associated with disability, hospitalization, and death. Measuring frailty can be a useful tool to determine the risk and prognosis of COVID-19 patients in the acute setting, and to provide higher quality of care for vulnerable individuals in the outpatient setting. A literature review was conducted to examine current research regarding frailty and COVID-19. Frailty can inform holistic care of COVID-19 patients, and further investigation is needed to elucidate how measuring frailty should guide treatment and prevention of COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34207220	Estrogen Receptor Modulators in Viral Infections Such as SARS-CoV-2: Therapeutic Consequences. COVID-19 is a pandemic respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The worldwide epidemiologic data showed higher mortality in males compared to females, suggesting a hypothesis about the protective effect of estrogens against severe disease progression with the ultimate end being patient's death. This article summarizes the current knowledge regarding the potential effect of estrogens and other modulators of estrogen receptors on COVID-19. While estrogen receptor activation shows complex effects on the patient's organism, such as an influence on the cardiovascular/pulmonary/immune system which includes lower production of cytokines responsible for the cytokine storm, the receptor-independent effects directly inhibits viral replication. Furthermore, it inhibits the interaction of IL-6 with its receptor complex. Interestingly, in addition to natural hormones, phytestrogens and even synthetic molecules are able to interact with the estrogen receptor and exhibit some anti-COVID-19 activity. From this point of view, estrogen receptor modulators have the potential to be included in the anti-COVID-19 therapeutic arsenal.	Mechanism;Treatment
34292525	Provider attitudes and satisfaction with rapid preoperative point-of-care COVID-19 testing using ID NOW. PURPOSE: Healthcare workers have experienced high levels of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly when caring for patients with unknown infection status. We trialled rapid preoperative point-of-care COVID-19 testing using the Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 for clinical validation in an urgent surgical population at a single centre in British Columbia, Canada. Here, we sought to determine the opinions and beliefs of operating room (OR) staff on the usefulness and effectiveness of point-of-care tests on workflow and wellbeing in the OR. METHODS: This descriptive study used a mixed-methods cross-sectional survey of all OR staff (nurses, anesthesiologists, surgeons, and ancillary staff) at a single centre after using the ID NOW for three months. Outcomes of interest included healthcare worker satisfaction with the ID NOW, effects on OR workflow, and worries about COVID-19 transmission. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 56% (n = 133), and was highest among anesthesiologists (100%, n = 38). Respondents were satisfied with the performance of the ID NOW for rapid COVID-19 testing in preoperative patients, giving it a mean (standard deviation [SD]) rate of 4.4 [1.4] on a five-point scale. Most (115/128, 90%) recommended continued use of the ID NOW on asymptomatic patients while there are active cases of COVID-19 in the community. Respondents felt that preoperative COVID-19 testing with the ID NOW made the OR safer for staff (mean [SD] rate, 4.2 [0.8]) and patients (mean [SD] rate, 4.0 [0.9]). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to maintain the physical and mental wellbeing of hospital staff. Rapid point-of-care testing increased the sense of workplace safety, improved morale, and reduced worry associated with COVID-19 without excessive disruption of OR workflow.	Prevention
34290811	"Saliva: Both a Threat and an Opportunity in Covid-19 Pandemic. Covid-19 pandemic, continues all over the world with the increasing number of confirmed cases and performed tests day by day. It has been shown that collecting nasopharyngeal samples, as the most commonly prefered method to perform RT-PCR, has disadvantages like causing discomfort and bleeding in patients. Sample collecting procedure also renders healthcare professionals by exposing them to the risk of transmission of the virus related to the direct contact with patients. These disadvantages make this procedure undesirable for the researchers and forces them to search for an alternative technique. At this point, saliva appears as an opportunity, regarding its high viral load. On the other hand, this high viral load poses a threat, especially for professions such as dental practitioners, with too much aerosol exposure. Since dentistry is a branch of health that constantly needs direct operations, it is necessary to be protected from the virus as much as possible while caring for the patient. A literature review was done using electronic databases ""PubMed,"" ""Google Scholar,"" and ""Cochrane Database,"" on January 2021. Studies have proposed many different preventive measures in this regard. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to draw attention to the saliva by bringing together the recent research and also to provide information and a perspective to dental clinicians about both prevention and a potential diagnostic technique."

34290701	Hypopharyngeal Ulcers in COVID-19: Histopathological and Virological Analyses - A Case Report. In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ulcerative lesions have been episodically reported in various segments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including the oral cavity, oropharynx, esophagus, stomach and bowel. In this report, we describe an autopsy case of a COVID-19 patient who showed two undiagnosed ulcers at the level of the anterior and posterior walls of the hypopharynx. Molecular testing of viruses involved in pharyngeal ulcers demonstrated the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, together with herpes simplex virus 1 DNA. Histopathologic analysis demonstrated full-thickness lympho-monocytic infiltration (mainly composed of CD68-positive cells), with hemorrhagic foci and necrosis of both the mucosal layer and deep skeletal muscle fibers. Fibrin and platelet microthrombi were also found. Cytological signs of HSV-1 induced damage were not found. Cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit 1 were immunohistochemically identified in the inflammatory infiltrations. Immunohistochemistry for HSV1 showed general negativity for inflammatory infiltration, although in the presence of some positive cells. Thus, histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular findings supported a direct role by SARS-CoV-2 in producing local ulcerative damage, although a possible contributory role by HSV-1 reactivation cannot be excluded. From a clinical perspective, this autopsy report of two undiagnosed lesions put the question if ulcers along the GI tract could be more common (but frequently neglected) in COVID-19 patients.

34360459	Effect of Train-Induced Wind on the Transmission of COVID-19: A New Insight into Potential Infectious Risks. The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has caused a traffic tie-up across the world. In addition to home quarantine orders and travel bans, the social distance guideline of about six feet was enacted to reduce the risk of contagion. However, with recent life gradually returning to normal, the crisis is not over. In this research, a moving train test and a Gaussian puff model were employed to investigate the impact of wind raised by a train running on the transmission and dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 from infected individuals. Our findings suggest that the 2 m social distance guideline may not be enough; under train-induced wind action, human respiratory disease-carrier droplets may travel to unexpected places. However, there are deficiencies in passenger safety guidelines and it is necessary to improve the quantitative research in the relationship between train-induced wind and virus transmission. All these findings could provide a fresh insight to contain the spread of COVID-19 and provide a basis for preventing and controlling the pandemic virus, and probe into strategies for control of the disease in the future.

34200723	"Application of Telehealth in Prenatal Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Cross-Sectional Survey of Polish Women. To reduce the risk of infection of SARS-CoV-2 during commuting to the clinic or due to contact with medical staff, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended arranging some appointments in the form of ""telehealth"". The aim of the study was to assess the access to medical care in pregnancy during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the role of telehealth in the implementation of prenatal care standards. This is a cross-sectional study. The study group included 618 women who were pregnant and/or gave birth in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of the participants experienced difficulties accessing medical care because of the pandemic. The correlation between this experience and the use of the hybrid healthcare model was established. The affiliation to public or private healthcare was irrelevant. There was no relationship between healthcare (private/public or in-person/hybrid) and implementation of the prenatal care standards. To ensure safe access to prenatal care for pregnant women, recommendations for a hybrid pregnancy management model should be created with detailed information regarding which appointments patients must be present for in-person and which can be conducted remotely. To reduce the risks associated with movement and interpersonal contact, all visits during which tests and screenings take place should be conducted in-person; other appointments can be arranged in the form of telehealth."

34210623	Side effects and antibody titer transition of the BNT162b2 messenger ribonucleic acid coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine in Japan. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has afflicted large populations worldwide. Although vaccines aroused great expectations, their side effects on Japanese people and the antibody titer transition after vaccination are unclear. METHODS: The side effects of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in participants who received vaccination at our center were investigated. Some participants were also surveyed for the antibody titer transition. RESULTS: In this study, 983 and 798 Japanese participants responded to the first and second doses, respectively. Side effects occurred in 757 (77.0%) and 715 participants (90.0%) after the first and second doses, respectively. No Grade 4 side effects occurred. The second dose had significantly more side effects than the first dose (p < 0.001). Side effects occurred after the second dose in 571 female (92.1%) and 178 male participants (80.1%). Female participants had a higher incidence of side effects than the male participants (p < 0.001). A comparison among the age groups showed significant differences (p = 0.018), and the frequency of side effects decreased with age. Twenty-three individuals participated in the survey of antibody titer transition. After the second vaccine dose, the median antibody titers for IgG and IgM were 3.76 and 0.07 AU/mL, respectively. Both IgG and IgM titers showed a significant increase over the study period (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine might be safe for Japanese people, and the antibody titer increased with two doses of vaccination. Larger nationwide studies are warranted to verify these findings.	Treatment
34283001	Early approval of COVID-19 vaccines: Pros and cons. The development of safe and effective vaccines has been an overriding priority for controlling the 2019-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. From the onset, COVID-19 has caused high mortality and economic losses and yet has also offered an opportunity to advance novel therapeutics such as DNA and mRNA vaccines. Although it is hoped that the swift acceptance of such vaccines will prevent loss of life, rejuvenate economies and restore normal life, there could also be significant pitfalls. This perspective provides an overview of future directions and challenges in advancing promising vaccine platforms to widespread therapeutic use.	Treatment
34209484	Rapid and Sensitive Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Label-Free Manner Using Micromechanical Sensors. Coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been identified as a deadly pandemic. The genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 is performed using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique for identifying viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in infected patients. However, the RT-PCR diagnostic technique is manually laborious and expensive; therefore, it is not readily accessible in every laboratory. Methodological simplification is crucial to combat the ongoing pandemic by introducing quick, efficient, and affordable diagnostic methods. Here, we report how microcantilever sensors offer promising opportunities for rapid COVID-19 detection. Our first attempt was to capture the single-stranded complementary DNA of SARS-CoV-2 through DNA hybridization. Therefore, the microcantilever surface was immobilized with an oligonucleotide probe and detected using complementary target DNA hybridization by a shift in microcantilever resonance frequency. Our results show that microcantilever sensors can discriminate between complementary and noncomplementary target DNA on a micro to nanoscale. Additionally, the microcantilever sensors' aptitude toward partial complementary DNA determines their potential to identify new variants of coronavirus. Therefore, microcantilever sensing could be a vital tool in the effort to extinguish the spreading COVID-19 pandemic.	Diagnosis
34226219	Randomised, controlled, open label, multicentre clinical trial to explore safety and efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen for preventing ICU admission, morbidity and mortality in adult patients with COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 may cause severe pneumonitis and trigger a massive inflammatory response that requires ventilatory support. The intensive care unit (ICU)-mortality has been reported to be as high as 62%. Dexamethasone is the only of all anti-inflammatory drugs that have been tested to date that has shown a positive effect on mortality. We aim to explore if treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is safe and effective for patients with severe COVID-19. Our hypothesis is that HBO can prevent ICU admission, morbidity and mortality by attenuating the inflammatory response. The primary objective is to evaluate if HBO reduces the number of ICU admissions compared with best practice treatment for COVID-19, main secondary objectives are to evaluate if HBO reduces the load on ICU resources, morbidity and mortality and to evaluate if HBO mitigates the inflammatory reaction in COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised, controlled, phase II, open label, multicentre trial. 200 subjects with severe COVID-19 and at least two risk factors for mortality will be included. Baseline clinical data and blood samples will be collected before randomisation and repeated daily for 7 days, at days 14 and 30. Subjects will be randomised with a computer-based system to HBO, maximum five times during the first 7 days plus best practice treatment or only best practice treatment. The primary endpoint, ICU admission, is defined by criteria for selection for ICU. We will evaluate if HBO mitigates the inflammatory reaction in COVID-19 using molecular analyses. All parameters are recorded in an electronic case report form. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will review the safety parameters. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial is approved by The National Institutional Review Board in Sweden (2020-01705) and the Swedish Medical Product Agency (5.1-2020-36673). Positive, negative and any inconclusive results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals with open access. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04327505. EudraCT number: 2020-001349-37.	Treatment
34208050	Significant Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro by a Green Tea Catechin, a Catechin-Derivative, and Black Tea Galloylated Theaflavins. Potential effects of tea and its constituents on SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed in vitro. Infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 was decreased to 1/100 to undetectable levels after a treatment with black tea, green tea, roasted green tea, or oolong tea for 1 min. An addition of (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) significantly inactivated SARS-CoV-2, while the same concentration of theasinensin A (TSA) and galloylated theaflavins including theaflavin 3,3'-di-O-gallate (TFDG) had more remarkable anti-viral activities. EGCG, TSA, and TFDG at 1 mM, 40 microM, and 60 microM, respectively, which are comparable to the concentrations of these compounds in tea beverages, significantly reduced infectivity of the virus, viral RNA replication in cells, and secondary virus production from the cells. EGCG, TSA, and TFDG significantly inhibited interaction between recombinant ACE2 and RBD of S protein. These results suggest potential usefulness of tea in prevention of person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus.	Mechanism;Treatment
34286502	"The prolonged effects of COVID-19. A new ""threat""? Coronavirus 'long-haulers"" currently represent a significant public health concern. Recent reports suggest that persistent effects of COVID-19, such as fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, anxiety, depression, arthralgia, may last for months and lead to a decline in quality of life. Risk factors for long COVID are still not very well understood. Survivors suffer from ongoing symptoms. This new entity highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach that would enable closer monitoring of affected patients and implementation of measures that could reduce the impact of the pandemic on the overall patient wellbeing after the resolution of acute symptoms."

34333650	The emergence and transmission of COVID-19 in European countries, 2019-2020: a comprehensive review of timelines, cases and containment. When it emerged in late 2019, COVID-19 was carried via travelers to Germany, France and Italy, where freedom of movement accelerated its transmission throughout Europe. However, effective non-pharmaceutical interventions introduced by European governments led to containment of the rapid increase in cases within European nations. Electronic searches were performed to obtain the number of confirmed cases, incident rates and non-pharmaceutical government measures for each European country. The spread and impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions throughout Europe were assessed and visualized. Specifically, heatmaps were used to represent the number of confirmed cases and incident rates for each of the countries over time. In addition, maps were created showing the number of confirmed cases and incident rates in Europe on three different dates (15 March, 15 April and 15 May 2020), which allowed us to assess the geographic and temporal patterns of the disease.

34218943	Benefits of early use of high-flow-nasal-cannula (HFNC) in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia. INTRODUCTION: Severe COVID-19 is associated with hypoxemic bilateral pneumonia that leads to mechanical ventilation in a considerable proportion of patients. To the best of our knowledge, there are no recommendations about the best time to initiate high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of all patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia who required HNFO between March 2020 and February 2021. Patients were grouped in early HNFC or late HNFC, according to the modified Kirby index. RESULTS: 53 patients were included. Forty-four of them were included in the early HFNC and 9 in late HNFC. There were no statistically significant clinical-epidemiological differences. Early use of HFNC was associated with a decrease in the need for intubation (29.5 vs. 66.6%, p = 0.044), hospital stay (18.8 d vs. 36 d, p = 0.022) and mortality (22.7 vs. 55.5%, p = 0.061). CONCLUSIONS: Early HFNC use is associated with a decrease in the need for intubation, mortality and overall hospital stay.	Treatment;Diagnosis
34286500	Fusobacterium nucleatum and alteration of the oral microbiome: from pregnancy to SARS-COV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE: The human being has evolved in close symbiosis with its own ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria. After the intestinal microbiome, that of the oral cavity is the largest and most diversified. Its importance is reflected not only in local and systemic diseases, but also in pregnancy since it would seem to influence the placental microbiome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a literature review of articles published in PubMed about Fusobacterium Nucleatum and both its implications with systemic and oral health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, flavors perception and its interference in the oral-nasal mucosal immunity. RESULTS: It is in maintaining the microbiome's homeostasis that the Fusobacterium nucleatum, an opportunistic periodontal pathogen of the oral cavity, plays a crucial role both as a bridge microorganism of the tongue biofilm, and in maintaining the balance between the different species in the oral-nasal mucosal immunity also by taste receptors interaction. It is also involved in the flavor perception and its detection in the oral microbiome of children from the first days of life suggests a possible physiological role. However, the dysbiosis can determine its pathogenicity with local and systemic consequences, including the pathogenesis of respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: It is interesting to evaluate its possible correlation with Sars-CoV-2 and the consequences on the microflora of the oral cavity, both to promote a possible broad-spectrum preventive action, in favor of all subjects for whom, by promoting the eubiosis of the oral microbiome, a defensive action could be envisaged by the commensals themselves but, above all, for patients with specific comorbidities and therefore already prone to oral dysbiosis.

34349145	Gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate, OZG-38.61.3, confers protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in human ACEII-transgenic mice. The SARS-CoV-2 virus caused the most severe pandemic around the world, and vaccine development for urgent use became a crucial issue. Inactivated virus formulated vaccines such as Hepatitis A and smallpox proved to be reliable approaches for immunization for prolonged periods. In this study, a gamma-irradiated inactivated virus vaccine does not require an extra purification process, unlike the chemically inactivated vaccines. Hence, the novelty of our vaccine candidate (OZG-38.61.3) is that it is a non-adjuvant added, gamma-irradiated, and intradermally applied inactive viral vaccine. Efficiency and safety dose (either 10(13) or 10(14) viral RNA copy per dose) of OZG-38.61.3 was initially determined in BALB/c mice. This was followed by testing the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the vaccine. Human ACE2-encoding transgenic mice were immunized and then infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the challenge test. This study shows that vaccinated mice have lowered SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA copy numbers both in oropharyngeal specimens and in the histological analysis of the lung tissues along with humoral and cellular immune responses, including the neutralizing antibodies similar to those shown in BALB/c mice without substantial toxicity. Subsequently, plans are being made for the commencement of Phase 1 clinical trial of the OZG-38.61.3 vaccine for the COVID-19 pandemic.	Treatment;Mechanism
34204885	SARS-CoV-2, a Threat to Marine Mammals? A Study from Italian Seawaters. Zoonotically transmitted coronaviruses were responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the dramatic Coronavirus Disease-2019 (CoViD-19) pandemic, which affected public health, the economy, and society on a global scale. The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic permeated into our environment and wildlife as well; in particular, concern has been raised about the viral occurrence and persistence in aquatic and marine ecosystems. The discharge of untreated wastewaters carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to sea mammals may have dramatic consequences on vulnerable species. The efficient transmission of coronaviruses raises questions regarding the contributions of virus-receptor interactions. The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), serving as a functional receptor for the viral spike (S) protein. This study aimed, through the comparative analysis of the ACE-2 receptor with the human one, at assessing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 for different species of marine mammals living in Italian waters. We also determined, by means of immunohistochemistry, ACE-2 receptor localization in the lung tissue from different cetacean species, in order to provide a preliminary characterization of ACE-2 expression in the marine mammal respiratory tracts. Furthermore, to evaluate if and how Italian wastewater management and coastal exposition to extreme weather events may led to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, geomapping data were carried out and overlapped. The results showed the potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure for marine mammals inhabiting Italian coastal waters, putting them at risk when swimming and feeding in specific risk areas. Thus, we highlighted the potential hazard of the reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with its impact on marine mammals regularly inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea, while also stressing the need for appropriate action in order to prevent further damage to specific vulnerable populations.

34215236	Protocol of the Cologne Corona Surveillance (CoCoS) Study- a prospective population-based cohort study. BACKGROUND: Surveillance strategies are critical to cope with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to evaluate, as well as adjust government-imposed countermeasures. Incidence estimates are widely based on laboratory confirmed cases reported by health authorities. Prevalence and incidence data of SARS-CoV-2 is still scarce, along with demographic and behavioural factors associated with infection risk. METHODS: The Cologne Corona Surveillance Study will be conducted in the City of Cologne, which is the fourth-largest city in Germany with a population of approximately 1.1 million. Researchers will apply self-sampling surveillance to a rolling cohort of Cologne residents. Random samples of 6000 Cologne residents 18 years of age and older will be drawn from the registration office. Upon receiving the information and saliva sample kit, participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire online or via phone, sign written informed consent, and send back written consent, as well as saliva sample. The saliva samples will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse PCR. The questionnaire will be administered to gather information about personal characteristics such as health status and risks. A second round of testing will take place 6 weeks after the first. DISCUSSION: Self-administered saliva sampling proved to be a legitimate and feasible alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs taken by health professionals. However, it is unclear whether the targeted response rate of 40% can be achieved and whether the results are representative of the population.

34348905	"Self-assembling synthetic nanoadjuvant scaffolds cross-link B cell receptors and represent new platform technology for therapeutic antibody production. Host antibody responses are pivotal for providing protection against infectious agents. We have pioneered a new class of self-assembling micelles based on pentablock copolymers that enhance antibody responses while providing a low inflammatory environment compared to traditional adjuvants. This type of ""just-right"" immune response is critical in the rational design of vaccines for older adults. Here, we report on the mechanism of enhancement of antibody responses by pentablock copolymer micelles, which act as scaffolds for antigen presentation to B cells and cross-link B cell receptors, unlike other micelle-forming synthetic block copolymers. We exploited this unique mechanism and developed these scaffolds as a platform technology to produce antibodies in vitro. We show that this novel approach can be used to generate laboratory-scale quantities of therapeutic antibodies against multiple antigens, including those associated with SARS-CoV-2 and Yersinia pestis, further expanding the value of these nanomaterials to rapidly develop countermeasures against infectious diseases."

34218168	Respiratory care for the critical patients with 2019 novel coronavirus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted through respiratory droplets, aerosols and close contact. Cross infections occur because viruses spread rapidly among humans. Nineteen percent (19%) of the infected patients developed severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Hypoxemia usually occurs and patients may require oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation (MV) support. In this article, recently published clinical experience and observational studies were reviewed. Corresponding respiratory therapy regarding different stages of infection is proposed. Infection control principles and respiratory strategies including oxygen therapy, non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS), intubation evaluation, equipment preparation, ventilator settings, special maneuvers comprise of the prone position (PP), recruitment maneuver (RM), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), weaning and extubation are summarized. Respiratory equipment and device disinfection recommendations are worked up. We expect this review article could be used as a reference by healthcare workers in patient care while minimizing the risk of environmental contamination.	Prevention;Treatment
34219976	The impact of repeated mass antigen testing for COVID-19 on the prevalence of the disease. In the absence of effective vaccination, mass testing and quarantining of positive cases and their contacts could help to mitigate pandemics and allow economies to stay open. We investigate the effects of repeated mass testing on the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, using data from the first ever nationwide rapid antigen testing implemented in Slovakia in autumn 2020. After the first round of testing, only districts above an ex ante unknown threshold of test positivity were re-tested. Comparing districts above and below the threshold, we provide evidence that repeated mass antigen testing can temporarily reduce the number of new infections. Our results suggest that mass testing coupled with the quarantining of positive cases and their contacts could be an effective tool in mitigating pandemics. For lasting effects, re-testing at regular intervals would likely be necessary.	Prevention
34333265	Shedding light on toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 peptides in aquatic biota: A study involving neotropical mosquito larvae (Diptera: Culicidae). Knowledge about how the COVID-19 pandemic can affect aquatic wildlife is still extremely limited, and no effect of SARS-CoV-2 or its structural constituents on invertebrate models has been reported so far. Thus, we investigated the presence of the 2019-new coronavirus in different urban wastewater samples and, later, evaluated the behavioral and biochemical effects of the exposure of Culex quinquefasciatus larvae to two SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptides (PSPD-2002 and PSPD-2003) synthesized in our laboratory. Initially, our results show the contamination of wastewater by the new coronavirus, via RT-qPCR on the viral N1 gene. On the other hand, our study shows that short-term exposure (48 h) to a low concentration (40 mug/L) of the synthesized peptides induced changes in the locomotor and the olfactory-driven behavior of the C. quinquefascitus larvae, which were associated with increased production of ROS and AChE activity (cholinesterase effect). To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the larval phase of a freshwater invertebrate species. The results raise concerns at the ecological level where the observed biological effects may lead to drastic consequences.	Mechanism
34207184	Advanced Research and Development of Face Masks and Respirators Pre and Post the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Critical Review. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, has accelerated the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) masks as one of the methods to reduce and/or eliminate transmission of the coronavirus across communities. Despite the availability of different coronavirus vaccines, it is still recommended by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and local authorities to apply public safety measures including maintaining social distancing and wearing face masks. This includes individuals who have been fully vaccinated. Remarkable increase in scientific studies, along with manufacturing-related research and development investigations, have been performed in an attempt to provide better PPE solutions during the pandemic. Recent literature has estimated the filtration efficiency (FE) of face masks and respirators shedding the light on specific targeted parameters that investigators can measure, detect, evaluate, and provide reliable data with consistent results. This review showed the variability in testing protocols and FE evaluation methods of different face mask materials and/or brands. In addition to the safety requirements needed to perform aerosol viral filtration tests, one of the main challenges researchers currently face is the inability to simulate or mimic true aerosol filtration scenarios via laboratory experiments, field tests, and in vitro/in vivo investigations. Moreover, the FE through the mask can be influenced by different filtration mechanisms, environmental parameters, filtration material properties, number of layers used, packing density, fiber charge density, fiber diameter, aerosol type and particle size, aerosol face velocity and concentration loadings, and infectious concentrations generated due to different human activities. These parameters are not fully understood and constrain the design, production, efficacy, and efficiency of face masks.	Prevention
34348796	Management of proximal femur fractures in the elderly: current concepts and treatment options. As one of the leading causes of elderly patients' hospitalisation, proximal femur fractures (PFFs) will present an increasing socioeconomic problem in the near future. This is a result of the demographic change that is expressed by the increasing proportion of elderly people in society. Peri-operative management must be handled attentively to avoid complications and decrease mortality rates. To deal with the exceptional needs of the elderly, the development of orthogeriatric centres to support orthogeriatric co-management is mandatory. Adequate pain medication, balanced fluid management, delirium prevention and the operative treatment choice based on comorbidities, individual demands and biological rather than chronological age, all deserve particular attention to improve patients' outcomes. The operative management of intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures favours intramedullary nailing. For femoral neck fractures, the Garden classification is used to differentiate between non-displaced and displaced fractures. Osteosynthesis is suitable for biologically young patients with non-dislocated fractures, whereas total hip arthroplasty and hemiarthroplasty are the main options for biologically old patients and displaced fractures. In bedridden patients, osteosynthesis might be an option to establish transferability from bed to chair and the restroom. Postoperatively, the patients benefit from early mobilisation and early geriatric care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, prolonged time until surgery and thus an increased rate of complications took a toll on frail patients with PFFs. This review aims to offer surgical guidelines for the treatment of PFFs in the elderly with a focus on pitfalls and challenges particularly relevant to frail patients.	Prevention
34219389	The impact of the 2009 influenza pandemic on the seasonality of human respiratory syncytial virus: A systematic analysis. BACKGROUND: Several local studies showed that the 2009 influenza pandemic delayed the RSV season. However, no global-level analyses are available on the possible impact of the 2009 influenza pandemic on the RSV season. OBJECTIVES: We aim to understand the impact of the 2009 influenza pandemic on the RSV season. METHODS: We compiled data from published literature (through a systematic review), online reports/datasets and previously published data on global RSV seasonality and conducted a global-level systematic analysis on the impact of the 2009 influenza pandemic on RSV seasonality. RESULTS: We included 354 seasons of 45 unique sites, from 26 countries. Globally, the influenza pandemic delayed the onset of the first RSV season by 0.58 months on average (95% CI: 0.42, 0.73; maximum delay: 2.5 months) and the onset of the second RSV season by a lesser extent (0.25 months; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.39; maximum delay: 3.4 months); no delayed onset was observed for the third RSV season. The delayed onset was most pronounced in the northern temperate, followed by the southern temperate, and was least pronounced in the tropics. CONCLUSIONS: The 2009 influenza pandemic delayed the RSV onset on average by 0.58 months and up to 2.5 months. This suggests evidence of viral interference as well as the impact of public health measures and has important implications for preparedness for RSV season during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.

34218521	Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Repurposing Drug Database: Clinical Pharmacology Considerations. A critical step to evaluate the potential in vivo antiviral activity of a drug is to connect the in vivo exposure to its in vitro antiviral activity. The Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Repurposing Drug Database is a database that includes both in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and in vivo pharmacokinetic data to facilitate the extrapolation from in vitro antiviral activity to potential in vivo antiviral activity for a large set of drugs/compounds. In addition to serving as a data source for in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and in vivo pharmacokinetic information, the database is also a calculation tool that can be used to compare the in vitro antiviral activity with in vivo drug exposure to identify potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. Continuous development and expansion are feasible with the public availability of this database.	Treatment
34219846	Monitoring of new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): Origin, transmission, and food preservation methods. Unfortunately, there is limited research on coronavirus survival of food products and also food processing. The knowledge of the physical and chemical characteristics of coronaviruses mostly comes from the study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV physical (i.e., thermal processing, chilling and freezing, microwave irradiation, ultraviolet light, gamma irradiation, high hydrostatic pressure) and chemical (acidification and use of common disinfectants in the food industry like chlorinated derivatives and ozone) are means which could be used to inactive the coronaviruses or reduce the infection. These methods can be applied individually or in combination to act better performance. Thermal processing is one of the most effective methods for inactive coronavirus. Heating at 75 degrees C (15-60 min) and 65 degrees C (1 min) was the best temperature for inactive SARS-CoV and MERS virus, respectively. Among irradiation methods (microwave, UV, and gamma), the most effective one is UVC rays. Moreover, the use of disinfectant like chlorinated derivatives is appropriate way to disinfect food product surfaces. Novelty impact statement: This review provided updated information on effective strategies for inactive coronavirus that can be used in the food industry. SARS-CoV-2 as a new pandemic coronavirus was initiated from contaminated foods and can be transmitted by close contact, aerosols, and food surfaces. Food preservation (physical and chemical) methods could decrease SARS-CoV-2. Probably, heating and UVC are the most effective approach to inactive SARS-CoV-2. Despite the findings of coronavirus inactivation which were here discussed, much research is still needed for the development of new approaches to overcome the coronavirus.	Prevention;Transmission

34292875	ENDOCRINOLOGY IN THE TIME OF COVID-19 - 2021 updates: The Management of Diabetes insipidus and Hyponatraemia. COVID-19 has changed the nature of medical consultations, emphasizing virtual patient counseling, with relevance for patients with diabetes insipidus (DI) or hyponatremia. The main complication of desmopressin treatment in DI is dilutional hyponatraemia. Since plasma sodium monitoring is not always possible in times of COVID-19, we recommend to delay the desmopressin dose once a week until aquaresis occurs allowing excess retained water to be excreted. Patients should measure their body weight daily. Patients with DI admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 have a high risk for mortality due to volume depletion. Specialists must supervise fluid replacement and dosing of desmopressin. Patients after pituitary surgery should drink to thirst and measure their body weight daily to early recognize the development of postoperative SIAD. They should know hyponatraemia symptoms. Hyponatraemia in COVID-19 is common with a prevalence of 20 to 30% and is mostly due to SIAD or hypovolemia. It mirrors disease severity and is an early predictor for mortality. Hypernatraemia may also develop in COVID-19 patients, with a prevalence of 3-5%, especially in ICU, and derives from different multifactorial reasons, e.g. due to insensible water losses from pyrexia, increased respiration rate and use of diuretics. Hypernatraemic dehydration may contribute to the high risk of acute kidney injury in COVID-19. IV fluid replacement should be administered with caution in severe cases of COVID-19 because of the risk of pulmonary oedema.	Treatment
34373041	Investigating the potential mechanisms of depression induced-by COVID-19 infection in patients. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged now in the world as a pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes variant common symptoms, such as dry cough, tiredness, dyspnea, fever, myalgia, chills, headache, chest pain, and conjunctivitis. Different organs may be affected by COVID-19, such as the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and CNS. However, the information about the COVID-19 infection in the CNS is insufficient. We do know that the virus can enter the central nervous system (CNS) via different routes, causing symptoms such as dizziness, headache, seizures, loss of consciousness, and depression. Depression is the most common disorder among all neurological symptoms following COVID-19 infection, although the mechanism of COVID-19-induced depression is not yet clear. The aim of the present study is to investigate the probable mechanisms of COVID-19-induced depression. The reasons for depression in infected patients may be due to social and pathological factors including social quarantine, economic problems, stress, changes in the HPA axis, inflammation due to the entry of proinflammatory cytokines into the CNS, production of inflammatory cytokines by microglia, mitochondrial disorders, damage to the hippocampus, and malnutrition. By evaluating different factors involved in COVID-19-induced depression, we have concluded that depression can be minimized by controlling stress, preventing the cytokine storm with appropriate anti-inflammatory drugs, and proper nutrition.

34353649	Personal Protective Equipment Adherence of Pediatric Resuscitation Team Members During the COVID-19 Pandemic. STUDY OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers have had the highest risk of infection among essential workers. Although personal protective equipment (PPE) use is associated with lower infection rates, appropriate use of PPE has been variable among health care workers, even in settings with COVID-19 patients. We aimed to evaluate the patterns of PPE adherence during emergency department resuscitations that included aerosol-generating procedures. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, video-based review of pediatric resuscitations involving one or more aerosol-generating procedures during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (March to June 2020). Recommended adherence (complete, inadequate, absent) with 5 PPE items (headwear, eyewear, masks, gowns, gloves) and the duration of potential exposure were evaluated for individuals in the room after aerosol-generating procedure initiation. RESULTS: Among the 345 health care workers observed during 19 resuscitations, 306 (88.7%) were nonadherent (inadequate or absent adherence) with the recommended use of at least 1 PPE type at some time during the resuscitation, 23 (6.7%) of whom had no PPE. One hundred and forty health care workers (40.6%) altered or removed at least 1 type of PPE during the event. The aggregate time in the resuscitation room for health care workers across all events was 118.7 hours. During this time, providers had either absent or inadequate eyewear for 46.4 hours (39.1%) and absent or inadequate masks for 35.2 hours (29.7%). CONCLUSION: Full adherence with recommended PPE use was limited in a setting at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 virus aerosolization. In addition to ensuring appropriate donning, approaches are needed for ensuring ongoing adherence with PPE recommendations during exposure.	Prevention
34225541	Efficacy of combined Sofosbuvir and Daclatasvir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with pneumonia: a multicenter Egyptian study. BACKGROUND: Limited experimental and clinical evidence suggests a potential role for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir in treating COVID19. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of generic sofosbuvir/daclatasvir in treating COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicenter prospective study involved 174 patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomized into two groups. Group A (96 patients) received sofosbuvir (400 mg)/daclatasvir (60 mg) for 14 days in combination with conventional therapy. Group B (78 patients) received conventional therapy alone. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected at baseline, after 7, 14, and 28 days of therapy. Primary endpoint was rate of clinical/virological cure. RESULTS: A lower mortality rate was observed in group (A) (14% vs 21%, P = 0.07). After 1 month of therapy, no differences were found in rates of ICU admission, oxygen therapy, or ventilation. Additionally, a statistically significant shorter duration of hospital stay (9% vs 12%, P < 0.01) and a faster achievement of PCR negativity at day 14 (84% versus 47%, P < 0.01) were noticed in group (A). CONCLUSION: Adding sofosbuvir/daclatasvir to conventional therapy of COVID-19 is promising. Their use is associated with shorter hospital stay, faster PCR negativity and may be reduced mortality.

34344463	Association between HLA genotypes and COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and progression: a comprehensive review of the literature. The COVID-19 pandemic has markedly impacted on cultural, political, and economic structures all over the world. Several aspects of its pathogenesis and related clinical consequences have not yet been elucidated. Infection rates, as well morbidity and mortality differed within countries. It is intriguing for scientists to understand how patient genetics may influence the outcome of the condition, to clarify which aspects could be related the clinical variability of SARS-CoV-2 disease. We reviewed the studies exploring the role of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) genotypes on individual responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or progression, discussing also the contribution of the immunological patterns MHC-related. In March 2021, the main online databases were accessed. All the articles that investigated the possible association between the HLA genotypes and related polymorphisms with susceptibility, severity and progression of COVID-19 were considered. Although both genetic and environmental factors are certainly expected to influence the susceptibility to or protection of individuals, the HLA and related polymorphisms can influence susceptibility, progression and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The crucial role played by HLA molecules in the immune response, especially through pathogen-derived peptide presentation, and the huge molecular variability of HLA alleles in the human populations could be responsible for the different rates of infection and the different patients following COVID-19 infection.

34207437	A Machine Learning Approach as an Aid for Early COVID-19 Detection. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes the disease COVID-19 has forced us to go into our homes and limit our physical interactions with others. Economies around the world have come to a halt, with non-essential businesses being forced to close in order to prevent further propagation of the virus. Developing countries are having more difficulties due to their lack of access to diagnostic resources. In this study, we present an approach for detecting COVID-19 infections exclusively on the basis of self-reported symptoms. Such an approach is of great interest because it is relatively inexpensive and easy to deploy at either an individual or population scale. Our best model delivers a sensitivity score of 0.752, a specificity score of 0.609, and an area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic of 0.728. These are promising results that justify continuing research efforts towards a machine learning test for detecting COVID-19.	Diagnosis
34287693	Progression of myopia in a natural cohort of Chinese children during COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: To determine myopia progression in children during the COVID-19 and the related factors associated with myopia. METHODS: All subjects underwent three-timepoint ocular examinations that were measured in July 2019, January, and August 2020. We compared the changes in uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), mydriatic spherical equivalent (SE), and axial length (AL) between two periods (before and during COVID-19). A questionnaire was performed to investigate risk factors for myopia. RESULTS: Compared with before the COVID-19, the mean (S.D.) myopia progression during the COVID-19 was significantly higher in right eyes (- 0.93 (0.65) vs. - 0.33 (0.47) D; p < 0.001). However, the differences in UCVA changes and the axial elongation between two periods were clinically insignificant. Through logistic regressive analysis, we found the difference of the SE changes was associated with the baseline AL (P = 0.028; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.058, 2.632), online education (P = 0.02; 95% CI, 1.587, 8.665), and time of digital screen (p < 0.005; 95% CI, 1.587, 4.450). CONCLUSIONS: Children were at higher risk of myopia progression during COVID-19, which was associated with the baseline AL, the longtime online learning, and digital screen reading.	Prevention
34288595	The Development of the Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Learning Collaborative for Improving Patient-Reported Outcome Collection and Patient-Centered Communication in Adult Rheumatology. OBJECTIVE: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are an integral part of treat-to-target approaches in managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In clinical practice, however, routine collection, documentation, and discussion of PROs with patients are highly variable. The RISE LC (Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Learning Collaborative) was established to develop and share best practices in PRO collection and use across adult rheumatology practices in the United States METHODS: The goals of the RISE LC were developed through site surveys and in-person meetings. Participants completed a baseline survey on PRO collection and use in their practices. RISE LC learning sessions focused on improving communication around PROs with patients and enhancing shared decision-making in treatment plans. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the RISE LC pivoted to adapt PRO tools for telehealth. RESULTS: At baseline, all responding sites (n = 15) had established workflows for collecting PROs. Most sites used paper forms alone. PRO documentation in electronic health records was variable, with only half of the sites using structured data fields. To standardize and improve the use of PROs, participants iteratively developed a Clinical Disease Activity Index-based RA Disease Activity Communication Tool to solicit treatment goals and improve shared decision-making across sites. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated developing a tool to gauge PROs via telehealth. CONCLUSION: The RISE LC is a continuous, structured method for implementing strategies to improve PRO collection and use in rheumatological care, initially adapting from the Learning Collaborative model and extending to include features of a learning network. Future directions include measuring the impact of standardized PRO collection and discussion on shared decision-making and RA outcomes.	Prevention
34223134	Antibacterial use in the age of SARS-CoV-2. Background: Balancing the use of antibacterial therapy against selection for resistance in this pandemic era has introduced both questions and guidelines. In this project, we explored how prescription of empirical antibacterial therapy differs between those with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine whether COVID-19 status and other factors play a role in the prescription of antibacterial therapy in an inpatient setting at a large referral academic medical centre. Further analysis was conducted to determine whether these factors differ between those testing positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Of 405 patients in the cohort, 175 received antibacterial therapy and 296 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. A positive SARS-CoV-2 test carried an OR of 0.3 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.49) for receiving antibacterial treatment in the first 48 h after admission (P < 0.0001) adjusting for age and procalcitonin results. Patients were 1% and 3% less likely to receive antibacterials for every year increase in age in the overall group and among those testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Younger age was found to impact use of antibacterial therapy in both the overall analysis as well as the SARS-CoV-2 negative subgroup (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01). High procalcitonin values were found to be associated with increased antibacterial therapy use in both the overall and stratified analyses. Conclusions: Antibacterial therapy prescription differs by COVID-19 disease status, and procalcitonin results are most highly associated with antibacterial use across strata.	Treatment
34292335	Evaluation of a Clinical Decision Support Strategy to Increase Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Among Hospitalized Children Before Inpatient Discharge. Importance: Hospitalized children are at increased risk of influenza-related complications, yet influenza vaccine coverage remains low among this group. Evidence-based strategies about vaccination of vulnerable children during all health care visits are especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To design and evaluate a clinical decision support (CDS) strategy to increase the proportion of eligible hospitalized children who receive a seasonal influenza vaccine prior to inpatient discharge. Design, Setting, and Participants: This quality improvement study was conducted among children eligible for the seasonal influenza vaccine who were hospitalized in a tertiary pediatric health system providing care to more than half a million patients annually in 3 hospitals. The study used a sequential crossover design from control to intervention and compared hospitalizations in the intervention group (2019-2020 season with the use of an intervention order set) with concurrent controls (2019-2020 season without use of an intervention order set) and historical controls (2018-2019 season with use of an order set that underwent intervention during the 2019-2020 season). Interventions: A CDS intervention was developed through a user-centered design process, including (1) placing a default influenza vaccine order into admission order sets for eligible patients, (2) a script to offer the vaccine using a presumptive strategy, and (3) just-in-time education for clinicians addressing vaccine eligibility in the influenza order group with links to further reference material. The intervention was rolled out in a stepwise fashion during the 2019-2020 influenza season. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of eligible hospitalizations in which 1 or more influenza vaccines were administered prior to discharge. Results: Among 17740 hospitalizations (9295 boys [52%]), the mean (SD) age was 8.0 (6.0) years, and the patients were predominantly Black (n = 8943 [50%]) or White (n = 7559 [43%]) and mostly had public insurance (n = 11274 [64%]). There were 10997 hospitalizations eligible for the influenza vaccine in the 2019-2020 season. Of these, 5449 (50%) were in the intervention group, and 5548 (50%) were concurrent controls. There were 6743 eligible hospitalizations in 2018-2019 that served as historical controls. Vaccine administration rates were 31% (n = 1676) in the intervention group, 19% (n = 1051) in concurrent controls, and 14% (n = 912) in historical controls (P < .001). In adjusted analyses, the odds of receiving the influenza vaccine were 3.25 (95% CI, 2.94-3.59) times higher in the intervention group and 1.28 (95% CI, 1.15-1.42) times higher in concurrent controls than in historical controls. Conclusions and Relevance: This quality improvement study suggests that user-centered CDS may be associated with significantly improved influenza vaccination rates among hospitalized children. Stepwise implementation of CDS interventions was a practical method that was used to increase quality improvement rigor through comparison with historical and concurrent controls.	Prevention
34350941	Obesity, a major risk factor for immunity and severe outcomes of COVID-19. An influenza-like virus named SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for COVID-19 disease and spread worldwide within a short time. COVID-19 has now become a significant concern for public health. Obesity is highly prevalent worldwide and is considered a risk factor for impairing the adaptive immune system. Although diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and renal failure are considered the risk factors for COVID-19, obesity is not yet well-considered. This study approaches establishing a systemic association between the prevalence of obesity and its impact on immunity concerning the severe outcomes of COVID-19 utilizing existing knowledge. Overall study outcomes documented the worldwide prevalence of obesity, its effects on immunity, and a possible underlying mechanism covering obesity-related risk pathways for the severe outcomes of COVID-19. Overall understanding from the present study is that being an immune system impairing factor, the role of obesity in the severe outcomes of COVID-19 is worthy.	Mechanism;Treatment;Diagnosis
34343035	Impact of a two-dose varicella immunization program on the incidence of varicella: a multi-year observational study in Shanghai, China. BACKGROUND: It remains hesitant to include a two-dose varicella vaccine (VarV) in a national routine immunization program in China. We aimed to quantify the impact of the two-dose VarV on varicella incidence in Shanghai. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We directly extracted the data of varicella cases and VarV doses in 2013-2020 in Shanghai, and then estimated the effects of two-dose VarV using a Serfling model. RESULTS: A two-dose VarV immunization program has been extensively implemented since October 2017 and become free since August 2018 in Shanghai. Before and after this program, varicella cases significantly declined in children (P < 0.01), whereas did not in adults aged >18 years (P = 0.22). Compared to the predicted number of varicella cases, actual number was significantly lower by 8% in 2018 and 28% in 2019. Among children aged 4-6 years, the reduction in varicella cases was largest. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in varicella cases throughout 2020 (P < 0.001), in which the decrease due to social distancing for the COVID-19 was 54%. CONCLUSIONS: A two-dose VarV immunization program may further reduce approximately one-third of varicella cases in Shanghai. Children <4 years and adults benefit less in this program, which warrants enhancing the immunization.	Prevention;Treatment

34220192	Case reports of cerebral sinus venous thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has started in December 2019 and still ongoing. The disease has been expanding rapidly with a high variety of phenotypes from asymptomatic, mild respiratory tract infection, multiple organ system dysfunction, and death. Neurological manifestations also appear in patients with COVID-19, such as headache, seizures, a decrease of consciousness, and paralysis. The hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19 is associated with the thromboembolic incident including ischemic strokes, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary artery embolism, and many further. Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT) is a rare neurovascular emergency that is often found in critically ill patients. We report two cases of CSVT with different onsets, neurologic manifestations, and prognoses. Case presentation: Two cases of cerebral sinus venous thrombosis in COVID-19 patients were reported, following respiratory, hematology, and coagulation disarrangements, which was triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The first patient, which was presented with a seizure, had hypertension and diabetes mellitus as comorbidities. The latter case had no comorbidity but showed more severe presentations of COVID-19 such as brain and lung thrombosis, although already had several days of intravenous anticoagulant administrations. These two cases also have a different course of disease and outcomes, which were interesting topics to study. Conclusions: CSVT is one of the neurological complications of the COVID-19 when the brainstem venous drainage is involved. Despite successful alteration to the negative result of SARS-CoV-2 through the rt-PCR test, thrombogenesis and coagulation cascade continuing. Therefore, a high level of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), D-dimer, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP) are paramount indicators of poor prognosis.	Case Report
34205900	Supporting Breastfeeding in 2021 and Beyond-Lessons from the Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected maternal and infant health globally both directly from infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and indirectly from changes in health care resulting from social, economic, and health care policies unique to each country. The developing countries have to share the disproportionate burden on maternal and infant health. In this review, we discuss the uncertainties resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, vertical transmission of the virus, and its effects on breastfeeding of the newborn. The problems of families and communities caring for mothers with COVID-19 and its impact on breastfeeding in newborns are discussed. The challenges posed by the pandemic have forced us to think and devise innovative solutions, including telemedicine help for antenatal counseling, breastfeeding education, and lactation support. Optimal utilization of resources and technology to find creative solutions at the individual and the community level will help in facilitating maternal-infant bonding soon after birth. Appropriate health care policies to support pregnant and lactating mothers will go a long way in meeting healthy child development goals.	Prevention;Transmission
34291283	Lessons from the field: delivering trachoma mass drug administration safely in a COVID-19 context. The first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) interim guidance released by the World Health Organization recommended suspension of non-urgent community health interventions, including mass drug administration (MDA) for neglected tropical diseases. However, with no end in sight for the COVID-19 pandemic, it was crucial to find ways to restart MDA while testing measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission between health workers, volunteers and communities. Consequently, guidelines were developed for delivering MDA safely in a COVID-19 context and the training and implementation were assessed through an observation checklist. The study also gathered data on the feasibility of using the MDA platform to disseminate COVID-19 health education. The results suggest that delivering MDA safely in a COVID-19 context is possible but revealed significant challenges in using the MDA platform for COVID-19 education.	Prevention
34223186	Is Social Distancing Policy Effective in Controlling COVID-19? An Interrupted Time Series Analysis. Introduction: The social distancing plan is one of the ways that was implemented for management of COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the social distancing on reducing the daily new cases and deaths from COVID-19. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the data of daily new cases and daily deaths were collected from 15/02/2020 to 19/04/2020. Changes in the level and trend of daily new cases and daily deaths before and after the implementation of social distancing plan were evaluated using interrupted time series (ITS) analysis in STATA software. Results: The post-intervention trend had a decrease of 102 new cases per day and 7 new deaths per day compared to the pre-intervention trend (p < 0.001). Moreover, in the post-intervention period, the daily new cases had a decrease of 58 new cases per day and 2 new deaths per day (p < 0.001). Conclusion: It Could be concluded that social distancing plan directly affects the new daily cases and new daily deaths.	Prevention
34202844	A Brief Overview of Potential Treatments for Viral Diseases Using Natural Plant Compounds: The Case of SARS-Cov. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the more general global increase in viral diseases, has led researchers to look to the plant kingdom as a potential source for antiviral compounds. Since ancient times, herbal medicines have been extensively applied in the treatment and prevention of various infectious diseases in different traditional systems. The purpose of this review is to highlight the potential antiviral activity of plant compounds as effective and reliable agents against viral infections, especially by viruses from the coronavirus group. Various antiviral mechanisms shown by crude plant extracts and plant-derived bioactive compounds are discussed. The understanding of the action mechanisms of complex plant extract and isolated plant-derived compounds will help pave the way towards the combat of this life-threatening disease. Further, molecular docking studies, in silico analyses of extracted compounds, and future prospects are included. The in vitro production of antiviral chemical compounds from plants using molecular pharming is also considered. Notably, hairy root cultures represent a promising and sustainable way to obtain a range of biologically active compounds that may be applied in the development of novel antiviral agents.

34201505	The Fight against COVID-19 on the Multi-Protease Front and Surroundings: Could an Early Therapeutic Approach with Repositioning Drugs Prevent the Disease Severity? The interaction between the membrane spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of the human epithelial host cell is the first step of infection, which has a critical role for viral pathogenesis of the current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Following the binding between S1 subunit and ACE2 receptor, different serine proteases, including TMPRSS2 and furin, trigger and participate in the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. On the basis of the high virulence and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, other receptors have been found involved for viral binding and invasiveness of host cells. This review comprehensively discusses the mechanisms underlying the binding of SARS-CoV2 to ACE2 and putative alternative receptors, and the role of potential co-receptors and proteases in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the short therapeutic time window within which to act to avoid the devastating evolution of the disease, we focused on potential therapeutic treatments-selected mainly among repurposing drugs-able to counteract the invasive front of proteases and mild inflammatory conditions, in order to prevent severe infection. Using existing approved drugs has the advantage of rapidly proceeding to clinical trials, low cost and, consequently, immediate and worldwide availability.	Mechanism;Treatment
34226847	Bacterial coinfection among coronavirus disease 2019 patient groups: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 raised the attention towards bacterial coinfection and its role in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. This study aims to systematically review and identify the pooled prevalence of bacterial coinfection in the related articles. A comprehensive search was conducted in international databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase, to identify the articles on the prevalence of bacterial coinfections in COIVD-19 patients from 1 December 2019 until 30 December 2020. All observational epidemiological studies that evaluated the prevalence of bacterial coinfections in patients with COVID-19 were included without any restriction. Forty-two studies including a total sample size of 54,695 were included in the analysis. The pooled estimate for the prevalence of bacterial coinfections was 20.97% (95% CI: 15.95-26.46), and the pooled prevalence of bacterial coinfections was 5.20% (95% CI: 2.39-8.91) for respiratory subtype and 4.79% (95% CI: 0.11-14.61) for the gastrointestinal subtype. The pooled prevalence for Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office and South-East Asia Regional Office was 100% (95% CI: 82.35-100.00) and 2.61% (95% CI: 1.74-3.62). This rate of coinfection poses a great danger towards patients, especially those in critical condition. Although there are multiple complications and adverse effects related to extensive use of antibiotics to treat patients with COVID-19, it seems there is no other option except applying them, and it needs to be done carefully.

34200001	Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) toward the COVID-19 Vaccine in Oman: A Pre-Campaign Cross-Sectional Study. Oman is globally acknowledged for its well-structured immunization program with high vaccination coverage. The massive spread of misinformation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the easy access to various media channels, may affect acceptance of a vaccine, despite the inherent trust in the local system. This cross-sectional study evaluated the knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) in Oman toward COVID-19 vaccines. It included 3000 randomly selected adults answering a structured questionnaire via telephone. Participants were 66.7% Omani, 76% male, and 83.7% without comorbidities. Their mean age was 38.27 years (SD +/- 10.45). Knowledge of COVID-19's symptoms, mode of transmission, and attitudes toward the disease was adequate; 88.4% had heard of the vaccine, 59.3% would advise others to take it, 56.8% would take it themselves, and 47.5% would take a second dose. Males (CI = 2.37, OR = (2.00-2.81)) and Omani (CI = 1.956, OR = (4.595-2.397)) were more willing to be vaccinated. The history of chronic disease, source of vaccine knowledge, and education level were factors that affected the willingness to accept the vaccine. The Omani community's willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine can be enhanced by utilizing social media and community influencers to spread awareness about the vaccine's safety and efficacy.

34224753	Serological response to a single dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The delays in the production and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines and the growing number of fatal infections across the globe raised the question whether it would be more advantageous to vaccinate a larger group of individuals with one dose instead of a smaller one with two doses. Through a group of vaccinated healthcare workers, we describe the qualitative and quantitative serological response to a single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. We found that, before the second dose inoculation, 95.3 % (182/191) already had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and, half of them, antibodies concentrations against RBD (the key target of neutralizing antibodies) that reached maximum values for the used evaluation immunoassay. In order to improve the execution of vaccination programs, further studies are needed to assess whether there are individuals for whom a single dose of mRNA vaccine or a delay in the inoculation of the second dose, produce a sufficient immune response. Additionally, follow-up studies will help in understanding post-vaccination immunity, how long it lasts and how it relates to infection and reinfection.	Treatment
34336193	Disparities in global COVID-19 vaccination rates & allocation of resources to countries in need. As of July 20th, 2021, over 191 million confirmed COVID-related cases and 4.1 million COVID-related deaths have been documented across the globe. Vaccines were initially prioritized in healthcare workers (HCWs) and elderly populations to provide protection to high-risk individuals. However, despite the intra-and-international distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, there is considerable variability in the vaccination rates observed worldwide. For example, the United Arab Emirates reported 166 vaccine doses/100 population, whereas most of the countries in Africa have administered <10 doses/100 population. The inadequate supply of vaccinations in addition to the lack of swift distribution/reallocation of vaccines that arrived likely contribute to the low vaccination rates observed in Africa. The US and many countries in Europe began administering vaccines in December 2020, whereas the majority of countries in Africa began administering vaccines in March 2021. In order to mitigate COVID-related deaths, we recommend that countries join in the efforts of allocating COVID vaccines to countries in need. In addition, we recommend for the partial vaccination of a larger proportion of high-risk population as opposed to fully vaccinating half the amount. However, adequate supply of vaccines may be of limited use if not distributed in a time-sensitive manner. We recommend for the implementation of targeted and cost-effective vaccine allocation and distribution strategies in order to increase vaccination rates, reserve healthcare systems resources and avoid any preventable deaths associated with COVID-19 infections.

34341773	The SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: A meta-analysis of public DNA methylation and gene expression data. People with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) often report a high frequency of viral infections and flu-like symptoms during their disease course. Given that this reporting agrees with different immunological abnormalities and altered gene expression profiles observed in the disease, we aimed at answering whether the expression of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is also altered in these patients. In particular, a low expression of ACE2 could be indicative of a high risk of developing COVID-19. We then performed a meta-analysis of public data on CpG DNA methylation and gene expression of this enzyme and its homologous ACE protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and related subsets. We found that patients with ME/CFS have decreased methylation levels of four CpG probes in the ACE locus (cg09920557, cg19802564, cg21094739, and cg10468385) and of another probe in the promoter region of the ACE2 gene (cg08559914). We also found a decreased expression of ACE2 but not of ACE in patients when compared to healthy controls. Accordingly, in newly collected data, there was evidence for a significant higher proportion of samples with an ACE2 expression below the limit of detection in patients than healthy controls. Altogether, patients with ME/CFS can be at a higher COVID-19 risk and, if so, they should be considered a priority group for vaccination by public health authorities. To further support this conclusion, similar research is recommended for other human cell entry receptors and cell types, namely, those cells targeted by the virus.	Mechanism
34345875	How will mass-vaccination change COVID-19 lockdown requirements in Australia? Background To prevent future outbreaks of COVID-19, Australia is pursuing a mass-vaccination approach in which a targeted group of the population comprising healthcare workers, aged-care residents and other individuals at increased risk of exposure will receive a highly effective priority vaccine. The rest of the population will instead have access to a less effective vaccine. Methods We apply a large-scale agent-based model of COVID-19 in Australia to investigate the possible implications of this hybrid approach to mass-vaccination. The model is calibrated to recent epidemiological and demographic data available in Australia, and accounts for several components of vaccine efficacy. Findings Within a feasible range of vaccine efficacy values, our model supports the assertion that complete herd immunity due to vaccination is not likely in the Australian context. For realistic scenarios in which herd immunity is not achieved, we simulate the effects of mass-vaccination on epidemic growth rate, and investigate the requirements of lockdown measures applied to curb subsequent outbreaks. In our simulations, Australia's vaccination strategy can feasibly reduce required lockdown intensity and initial epidemic growth rate by 43% and 52%, respectively. The severity of epidemics, as measured by the peak number of daily new cases, decreases by up to two orders of magnitude under plausible mass-vaccination and lockdown strategies. Interpretation The study presents a strong argument for a large-scale vaccination campaign in Australia, which would substantially reduce both the intensity of future outbreaks and the stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions required for their suppression.

34202016	Predictors of Intention to Vaccinate against COVID-19 in the General Public in Hong Kong: Findings from a Population-Based, Cross-Sectional Survey. Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of COVID-19. Understanding factors associated with intention to receive COVID-19 vaccines is the key to a successful vaccination programme. This cross-sectional study explored the rate of vaccination intention and identified its predictors using the health belief model (HBM) in the general population in Hong Kong during the pandemic. Data were collected between December 2020 and January 2021 via telephone surveys. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with intention to receive COVID-19 vaccines. A total of 1255 adults (>18 years, 53% female) completed the telephone survey. Overall, 42% indicated an intention to vaccinate, 31.5% showed vaccine hesitancy, and 26.5% reported refusal to receive any COVID-19 vaccines. Individuals who were men, older in age, working, with past experiences of other pandemics, less concerned with the vaccine safety, with poorer knowledge about COVID-19, and having greater levels of perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, cues to action, and acceptance of governmental preventive measures related to COVID-19 were significantly more likely to report an intention to vaccinate. The low intention among the Hong Kong population reflects the importance of developing effective vaccination promotion campaigns with the predictors identified in this study.	Treatment;Prevention
34282578	"Investigating Decreased Rates of Nulliparous Cesarean Deliveries during the COVID-19 Pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Preventing the first cesarean delivery (CD) is important as CD rates continue to rise. During the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, quality improvement metrics at our hospital identified lower rates of CD. We sought to investigate this change and identify factors that may have contributed to the decrease. STUDY DESIGN: We compared nulliparous singleton deliveries at a large academic hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic (April through July 2020 during a statewide ""stay-at-home"" order) to those in the same months 1 year prior to the pandemic (April through July 2019). The primary outcome, mode of delivery, was obtained from the electronic medical record system, along with indication for CD. RESULTS: The cohort included 1,913 deliveries: 892 in 2019 and 1,021 in 2020. Patient characteristics (age, body mass index, race, ethnicity, and insurance type) did not differ between the groups. Median gestational age at delivery was the same in both groups. The CD rate decreased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with prior (28.9 vs. 33.6%; p = 0.03). There was a significant increase in the rate of labor induction (45.7 vs. 40.6%; p = 0.02), but no difference in the proportion of inductions that were elective (19.5 vs. 20.7%; p = 0.66). The rate of CD in labor was unchanged (15.9 vs. 16.3%; p = 0.82); however, more women attempted a trial of labor (87.0 vs. 82.6%; p = 0.01). Thus, the proportion of CD without a trial of labor decreased (25.1 vs. 33.0%; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: There was a statistically significant decrease in CD during the COVID-19 pandemic at our hospital, driven by a decrease in CD without a trial of labor. The increased rate of attempted trial of labor suggests the presence of patient-level factors that warrant further investigation as potential targets for decreasing CD rates. Additionally, in a diverse and medically complex population, increased rates of labor induction were not associated with increased rates of CD. KEY POINTS: . Primary CD rate fell during COVID-19 pandemic.. . Decrease was driven by more women attempting labor.. . Higher rate of induction without rise in CD rate was found.."	Prevention

The clinical trials of the two novel COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech; Moderna) reported delayed local injection site reactions.(1,2) Since vaccination rates increase, awareness of the adverse reactions is needed. This research letter reports a series of delayed localized hypersensitivity reactions to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with histopathologic confirmation.	Treatment
34201360	Transport of Aerosols in Underground Mine Workings in Terms of SARS-CoV-2 Virus Threat. This paper presents a method of implementation and the results of aerosol dispersion tests in underground mine workings. Numerous tests were carried out to determine the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection in the underground environment of the mines. The influence of selected parameters of mine air on the possibility and method of aerosol transmission through ventilation routes was experimentally determined in real conditions. The concentration of additional aerosols in the class of ultrafine and fine aerosols increased with the distance from the generator, while the concentration of coarse particles decreased. Assuming the consumption of the solution with which aerosols were generated, even at a small level of 1 cm(3)/min., the number of additional aerosols was several hundred particles in one cubic centimeter of air at a distance of 50-70 m from the generator. The concentration of ultrafine particles in the range of 40-20,000 nm increased from 122 particles/cm(3) to 209 particles/cm(3) at air temperature of 12 degrees C and relative humidity of 95-96%, and from 90 particles/cm(3) to 243 particles/cm(3) at air temperature of 17 degrees C and relative humidity of 76-82%, with the increasing distance from the generator (10 m to 50 m).

34211038	Spatiotemporal analysis of COVID-19 outbreaks in Wuhan, China. Few study has revealed spatial transmission characteristics of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. We aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan and its influence factors. Information of 32,682 COVID-19 cases reported through March 18 were extracted from the national infectious disease surveillance system. Geographic information system methods were applied to analysis transmission of COVID-19 and its influence factors in different periods. We found decrease in effective reproduction number (Rt) and COVID-19 related indicators through taking a series of effective public health measures including restricting traffic, centralized quarantine and strict stay-at home policy. The distribution of COVID-19 cases number in Wuhan showed obvious global aggregation and local aggregation. In addition, the analysis at streets-level suggested population density and the number of hospitals were associated with COVID-19 cases number. The epidemic situation showed obvious global and local spatial aggregations. High population density with larger number of hospitals may account for the aggregations. The epidemic in Wuhan was under control in a short time after strong quarantine measures and restrictions on movement of residents were implanted.	Prevention;Transmission
34354682	Causes and Consequences of COVID-19-Associated Bacterial Infections. The COVID-19 literature highlights that bacterial infections are more common in fatal cases than recovered cases. If bacterial infections drive mortality in COVID-19, this has clear implications for patient management. However, it is possible that the enrichment of bacterial infections in COVID-19 fatalities is simply a by-product of late-stage pathology, leading to different advice for patient management. To address this question, we review current knowledge on bacterial infections in COVID-19, assess information from past viral respiratory pandemics, and simulate alternate causal models of interactions between virus, bacteria, and mortality in COVID-19. From these models, we conclude that currently available data are not sufficient to discriminate between these alternate causal pathways, and we highlight what data are required to determine the relative contribution of bacterial infection to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. We further summarize the potential long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Mechanism;Treatment
34290742	Identification of Causal Genes of COVID-19 Using the SMR Method. Since the first report of COVID-19 in December 2019, more than 100 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Despite ongoing research, there is still limited knowledge about the genetic causes of COVID-19. To resolve this problem, we applied the SMR method to analyze the genes involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis by the integration of multiple omics data. Here, we assessed the SNPs associated with COVID-19 risk from the GWAS data of Spanish and Italian patients and lung eQTL data from the GTEx project. Then, GWAS and eQTL data were integrated by summary-data-based (SMR) methods using SNPs as instrumental variables (IVs). As a result, six protein-coding and five non-protein-coding genes regulated by nine SNPs were identified as significant risk factors for COVID-19. Functional analysis of these genes showed that UQCRH participates in cardiac muscle contraction, PPA2 is closely related to sudden cardiac failure (SCD), and OGT, as the interacting gene partner of PANO1, is associated with neurological disease. Observational studies show that myocardial damage, SCD, and neurological disease often occur in COVID-19 patients. Thus, our findings provide a potential molecular mechanism for understanding the complications of COVID-19.	Mechanism
33492406	A fully automated microfluidic PCR-array system for rapid detection of multiple respiratory tract infection pathogens. Rapid and accurate identification of respiratory tract infection pathogens is of utmost importance for clinical diagnosis and treatment, as well as prevention of pathogen transmission. To meet this demand, a microfluidic chip-based PCR-array system, Onestart, was developed. The Onestart system uses a microfluidic chip packaged with all the reagents required, and the waste liquid is also collected and stored on the chip. This ready-to-use system can complete the detection of 21 pathogens in a fully integrated manner, with sample lysis, nucleic acid extraction/purification, and real-time PCR sequentially implemented on the same chip. The entire analysis process is completed within 1.5 h, and the system automatically generates a test report. The lower limit-of-detection (LOD) of the Onestart assay was determined to be 1.0 x 10(3) copies.mL(-1). The inter-batch variation of cycle threshold (Ct) values ranged from 0.08% to 0.69%, and the intra-batch variation ranged from 0.9% to 2.66%. Analytical results of the reference sample mix showed a 100% specificity of the Onestart assay. The analysis of batched clinical samples showed consistency of the Onestart assay with real-time PCR. With its ability to provide rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of respiratory tract infection pathogens, application of the Onestart system will facilitate timely clinical management of respiratory tract infections and effective prevention of pathogen transmission. Onestart, a ready-to-use system, can detect 21 pathogens in a fully integrated manner on a microchip within 1.5 h.	Diagnosis
34375259	Lessons learned from SARS-CoV-2 measurements in wastewater. Standardized protocols for wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) for the RNA of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, are being developed and refined worldwide for early detection of disease outbreaks. We report here on lessons learned from establishing a WBS program for SARS-CoV-2 integrated with a human surveillance program for COVID-19. We have established WBS at three campuses of a university, including student residential dormitories and a hospital that treats COVID-19 patients. Lessons learned from this WBS program address the variability of water quality, new detection technologies, the range of detectable viral loads in wastewater, and the predictive value of integrating environmental and human surveillance data. Data from our WBS program indicated that water quality was statistically different between sewer sampling sites, with more variability observed in wastewater coming from individual buildings compared to clusters of buildings. A new detection technology was developed based upon the use of a novel polymerase called V2G. Detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater varied from 10(2) to 10(6) genomic copies (gc) per liter of raw wastewater (L). Integration of environmental and human surveillance data indicate that WBS detection of 100 gc/L of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was associated with a positivity rate of 4% as detected by human surveillance in the wastewater catchment area, though confidence intervals were wide (beta ~ 8.99 * ln(100); 95% CI = 0.90-17.08; p < 0.05). Our data also suggest that early detection of COVID-19 surges based on correlations between viral load in wastewater and human disease incidence could benefit by increasing the wastewater sample collection frequency from weekly to daily. Coupling simpler and faster detection technology with more frequent sampling has the potential to improve the predictive potential of using WBS of SARS-CoV-2 for early detection of the onset of COVID-19.

34131828	A Fully-Automated Method to Evaluate Coronavirus Disease Progression with COVID-19 Cough Sounds Using Minimal Phase Information. This paper focuses on an important issue of disease progression of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) through processing COVID-19 cough sounds by proposing a fully-automated method. The new method is based on time-domain exploiting only phase 1 data which is always available for any cough events. The proposed approach generates plausible click sequences consist of clicks for various cough samples from covid-19 patients. The click sequence, which is extracted from the phase slope function of an input signal, is used to calculate inter-click intervals (ICIs), and thereby a scoring index (SI) is derived based on coefficient of variation(CV) of the extracted ICIs. Moreover, probability density function (pdf) of the output click sequence is obtained. The method does not need to adjust any parameters. The experimental results achieved from real-recorded COVID-19 cough data using the medically annotated Novel Coronavirus Cough Database (NoCoCoDa) reveal that the proposed time-domain method can be a very useful tool for automatic cough sound processing to determine the disease progression of coronavirus patients.

34211520	COVID-19 diagnosis in a patient with critical limb ischemia: complications and clinical outcomes. A 67-year-old male diabetic patient with systemic arterial hypertension was admitted to the emergency department with a necrotic ulcer in the left external malleolus and no palpable popliteal or pedal pulses. Arterial Duplex ultrasound identified femoropopliteal occlusion, with popliteal refilling below the knee and a patent peroneal artery. An endovascular procedure was performed, requiring retrograde access to the popliteal artery to re-establish blood flow and deploy a popliteal stent. Technical success was achieved and the patient underwent debridement of the wound. Two days later, about 48 hours after the operation, the patient began to exhibit respiratory symptoms, with coughing and dyspnea. He immediately underwent a chest CT that identified ground glass opacities, the crazy-paving pattern, and bilateral air bronchogram in the lungs. A reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was positive for SARS-Cov-2. The patient was moved to an intensive care unit and put on mechanical ventilation. Both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were administered. Despite appropriate treatment, the patient died 4 days after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.	Case Report
34286365	No increased injury incidence in the German Bundesliga after the SARS-CoV-2 virus lockdown. INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus lockdown in 2020 resulted in a worldwide suspension of professional sports. The first major professional football league to restart after the lockdown was the German Bundesliga. This study investigates whether the injury incidence increased after the restart of the season with only 9 days of regular preparation time and without any friendly matches in comparison to three control periods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, injury analysis (at least 1 day of absence from official football matches or training sessions) of the German Bundesliga registry was standardised according to Hagglund et al. (Br J Sports Med 39:340-346, 2005) and Fuller et al. (Clin J Sports Med 16:97-106, 2006) for data collection and to previous publications for the validated use of media sources for injury registration. The study period after the lockdown in May and June of the 2019-2020 season was compared to three control periods: the period directly before the lockdown, the beginning of the 2019-2020 season and the 2018-2019 season final. RESULTS: The nine match days after the restart of the 2019-2020 season showed an overall injury incidence of 4.9 per 1000 h football. This rate was significantly lower than that of the previous season final (9 last match days, overall injury incidence: 6.9 per 1000 h football; p < 0.001) and not increased compared to the rates after the summer break (9 match days; incidence: 5.5/1000 h, p > 0.05) or the winter break (8 match days; incidence: 5.6/1000 h, p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The period after the unexpected break in the 2019-2020 season due to the coronavirus lockdown and the rapid return to competition showed no increase in the injury rate compared to the pre-lockdown period and a lower injury rate than in the previous season final. The unintentional mid-season rest with its potential for physical recovery and individual fitness training seems to have had a positive effect on injury occurrence.	Prevention
34289142	Comparison of clinical and biochemical features of hospitalized COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia patients. Both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and influenza viruses cause similar clinical presentations. It is essential to assess severely ill patients presenting with a viral syndrome for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. We aimed to compare clinical and biochemical features between pneumonia patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and H1N1. Sixty patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and 61 patients diagnosed with influenza pneumonia were hospitalized between October 2020-January 2021 and October 2017-December 2019, respectively. All the clinical data and laboratory results, chest computed tomography scans, intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. The median age was 65 (range 32-96) years for patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis and 58 (range 18-83) years for patients with influenza (p = 0.002). The comorbidity index was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 (p = 0.010). Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were statistically significantly more common in patients with COVID-19 (p = 0.019, p = 0.008, respectively). The distribution of severe disease and mortality was not significantly different among patients with COVID-19 than influenza patients (p = 0.096, p = 0.049).). In comparison with inflammation markers; C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly higher in influenza patients than patients with COVID-19 (p = 0.033). The presence of sputum was predictive for influenza (odds ratio [OR] 0.342 [95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1.130-0.899]). CRP and platelet were also predictive for COVID-19 (OR 4.764 [95% CI, 1.003-1.012] and OR 0.991 [95% CI 0.984-0.998], respectively. We conclude that sputum symptoms by itself are much more detected in influenza patients. Besides that, lower CRP and higher PLT count would be discriminative for COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34293815	Is Telemedicine the Preferred Visit Modality in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes? BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic limits access to diabetes clinics. Remote communication by phone calls and WhatsApp messages became available in the past years. However, the current need to avoid face-to-face meetings necessitates further expansion of telemedicine services. There are limited data whether the option of virtual meetings is a preferred therapeutic modality for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). OBJECTIVE: To assess in a cohort of T1D patients, their preference and perception of telemedicine. METHODS: T1D patients who are followed in a hospital-affiliated diabetes clinic were asked to fill a structured questionnaire aimed to determine their attitude towards telemedicine and their preference of virtual versus conventional visits. The questionnaire was offered to consecutive T1D patients who visited the clinic between August to October 2020. RESULTS: Seventy one T1D patients that fulfilled the questionnaire were included. Median age was 38 years, 39% were male, and median duration of diabetes was 18 years. Fourteen percent of the participants preferred only virtual visits, 24% only conventional visits and 62% preferred a combination of these modalities. Sex, origin, education, duration of diabetes, mode of insulin treatment and distance from the clinic were not associated with patients' preference, but older patients (>/= 61 years) tended to prefer conventional visits. Sixty-six percent felt confident in their ability to download data from their personal medical devices. CONCLUSIONS: Patients from a wide range of treatment modalities are willing to use telemedicine. However, virtual meetings cannot fully replace conventional visits in T1D especially in the older age group.	Prevention
34354082	Adenoviral vector vaccine platforms in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Adenoviral vectors have been explored as vaccine agents for a range of infectious diseases, and their ability to induce a potent and balanced immune response made them logical candidates to apply to the COVID-19 pandemic. The unique molecular characteristics of these vectors enabled the rapid development of vaccines with advanced designs capable of overcoming the biological challenges faced by early adenoviral vector systems. These successes and the urgency of the COVID-19 situation have resulted in a flurry of candidate adenoviral vector vaccines for COVID-19 from both academia and industry. These vaccines represent some of the lead candidates currently supported by Operation Warp Speed and other government agencies for rapid translational development. This review details adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines currently in human clinical trials and provides an overview of the new technologies employed in their design. As these vaccines have formed a cornerstone of the COVID-19 global vaccination campaign, this review provides a full consideration of the impact and development of this emerging platform.	Treatment
34348533	Single breath counting is an effective screening tool for forced vital capacity in ALS. Objective: To measure the correlation between single breath counting (SBC) and forced vital capacity (liters, FVCL) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and to define the utility of SBC for determining when patients meet the threshold for initiation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (FVC < 50% predicted [FVCpred]). Methods: Both patient paced (SBCpp) or externally paced (SBCep) counting along with FVCL+pred and standard clinical data were collected. Linear regression was used to examine SBCpp and SBCep as a predictor of FVCL. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of SBC categorically predicting FVCpred of </=50%. Results: In 30 ALS patients, SBC explained a moderate proportion of the variance in FVCL (SBCpp: R(2)= 0.431, p < 0.001; SBCep: R(2) = 0.511, p < 0.01); this proportion improved when including covariates (SBCpp: R(2)= 0.635, p < 0.01; SBCep: R(2)= 0.657, p < 0.01). Patients with minimal speech involvement performed similarly in unadjusted (SBCpp: R(2) = 0.511, p < 0.01; SBCep: R(2)= 0.595, p < 0.01) and adjusted (SBCpp: R(2) = 0.634, p < 0.01; SBCep: R(2)= 0.650, p < 0.01) models. SBCpp had 100% sensitivity and 60% specificity (area under curve (AUC) = 0.696) for predicting FVCpred <50%. SBCep had 100% sensitivity and 56% specificity (AUC = 0.696). With minimal speech involvement SBCpp and SBCep both had 100% sensitivity and 76.1% specificity (SPCpp: AUC = 0.845; SBCep: AUC = 0.857). Conclusions: SBC explains a moderate proportion of variance in FVC and is an extremely sensitive marker of poor FVC. When FVC cannot be obtained, such as during the current COVID-19 pandemic, SBC is helpful in directing patient care.	Prevention
34211506	COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 Variants: Current Challenges and Health Concern. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China, was triggered and unfolded quickly throughout the globe by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The new virus, transmitted primarily through inhalation or contact with infected droplets, seems very contagious and pathogenic, with an incubation period varying from 2 to 14 days. The epidemic is an ongoing public health problem that challenges the present global health system. A worldwide social and economic stress has been observed. The transitional source of origin and its transport to humans is unknown, but speedy human transportation has been accepted extensively. The typical clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are almost like colds. With case fatality rates varying from 2 to 3 percent, a small number of patients may experience serious health problems or even die. To date, there is a limited number of antiviral agents or vaccines for the treatment of COVID-19. The occurrence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection are outlined and comparatively analyzed, given the outbreak's urgency. The recent developments in diagnostics, treatment, and marketed vaccine are discussed to deal with this viral outbreak. Now the scientist is concerned about the appearance of several variants over the globe and the efficacy of the vaccine against these variants. There is a need for consistent monitoring of the virus epidemiology and surveillance of the ongoing variant and related disease severity.	Diagnosis;Treatment

34207861	Rintatolimod Induces Antiviral Activities in Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells: Opening for an Anti-COVID-19 Opportunity in Cancer Patients? Severe acute respiratory virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally leading to a devastating loss of life. Large registry studies have begun to shed light on the epidemiological and clinical vulnerabilities of cancer patients who succumb to or endure poor outcomes of SARS-CoV-2. Specific treatment for COVID-19 infections in cancer patients is lacking while the demand for treatment is increasing. Therefore, we explored the effect of Rintatolimod (Ampligen((R))) (AIM ImmunoTech, Ocala, FL, USA), a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist, to treat uninfected human pancreatic cancer cells (HPACs). The direct effect of Rintatolimod was measured by targeted gene expression profiling and by proteomics measurements. Our results show that Rintatolimod induces an antiviral effect in HPACs by inducing RNase-L-dependent and independent pathways of the innate immune system. Treatment with Rintatolimod activated the interferon signaling pathway, leading to the overexpression of several cytokines and chemokines in epithelial cells. Furthermore, Rintatolimod treatment increased the expression of angiogenesis-related genes without promoting fibrosis, which is the main cause of death in patients with COVID-19. We conclude that Rintatolimod could be considered an early additional treatment option for cancer patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 to prevent the complicated severity of the disease.

34221256	A prolonged steroid therapy may be beneficial in some patients after the COVID-19 pneumonia. INTRODUCTION: This report introduces two cases presenting absorption of considerable radiological changes in the course of the coronavirus pneumonia in patients treated with prolonged oral steroids.CASES: The first case concerns a male receiving steroids only during hospitalisation in the Infectious Disease Hospital. After discharge, the patient experienced increasing dyspnoea resulting in hospitalisation in our Department of Lung Diseases. HRCT revealed progression of a bilateral, middle, and basal ground-glass opacity when compared to the examination performed at the early stage of the disease. The supplementary oxygen therapy and steroids were administered, followed by extended prednisone consumption up to 2 months after discharge. Follow-up HRCT revealed an almost complete absorption of the ground-glass opacity. The second case concerns a male treated with steroids only during hospitalisation in the Infectious Disease Hospital. Chest CT revealed widespread bilateral ground-glass opacities with consolidations. After discharge with no treatment, he suffered from severe dyspnoea and exercise intolerance, resulting in hospitalisation on the 7(th) day of home stay. Since then, a continued steroid treatment was administered resulting in a clinical, spirometric, and radiological improvement.CONCLUSIONS: Based on these observations, patients after the COVID-pneumonia may derive benefits from a prolonged steroid treatment. Therefore, this class of medications should be considered in SARS-CoV-2 patients, especially in patients with persistent radiological changes and dyspnoea requiring the supplementary oxygen therapy. However, randomised controlled trials are required to establish guidelines for the steroid treatment in this group of patients.	Case Report
34217418	COVID-19 and cancer screening in Scotland: A national and coordinated approach to minimising harm. Screening is an important component of cancer control internationally. In Scotland, the National Health Service Scotland provides screening programmes for cervical, bowel and breast cancers. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the suspension of these programmes in March 2020. We describe the integrated approach to managing the impact of the pandemic on cancer screening programmes in Scotland throughout 2020. We outline the policy context and decision-making process leading to suspension, and the criteria and framework informing the subsequent, staggered, restart in subsequent months. The decision to suspend screening services in order to protect screening invitees and staff, and manage NHS capacity, was made after review of numbers of screening participants likely to be affected, and the potential number of delayed cancer diagnoses. Restart principles and a detailed route map plan were developed for each programme, seeking to ensure broad consistency of approach across the programmes and nationally. Early data indicates bowel, breast and cervical screening participation has increased since restart. Primary care has had to adapt to new infection prevention control measures for delivery of cervical screening. Cancer charities provided cancer intelligence and policy briefs to national bodies and Scottish Government, as well as supporting the public, patients and screening invitees through information and awareness campaigns. Emerging from the pandemic, there is recognition of the need and the opportunity to transform and renew both cancer and screening services in Scotland, and in particular to address long-standing workforce capacity problems through innovation and investment, and to continue to prioritise addressing health inequalities.

34282982	Mouthwashes with CPC Reduce the Infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 Variants In Vitro. Oral mouthwashes decrease the infectivity of several respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2. However, the precise agents with antiviral activity in these oral rinses and their exact mechanism of action remain unknown. Here we show that cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), a quaternary ammonium compound in many oral mouthwashes, reduces SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by inhibiting the viral fusion step with target cells after disrupting the integrity of the viral envelope. We also found that CPC-containing mouth rinses decreased more than a thousand times the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, while the corresponding vehicles had no effect. This activity was effective for different SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the B.1.1.7 or Alpha variant originally identified in United Kingdom, and in the presence of sterilized saliva. CPC-containing mouth rinses could therefore represent a cost-effective measure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in saliva, aiding to reduce viral transmission from infected individuals regardless of the variants they are infected with.

Here we show that the BNT162b2 vaccine induces robust immune responses comparable to responses in healthy donors.	Mechanism;Treatment
34335596	Immunopathogenesis of Different Emerging Viral Infections: Evasion, Fatal Mechanism, and Prevention. Different emerging viral infections may emerge in different regions of the world and pose a global pandemic threat with high fatality. Clarification of the immunopathogenesis of different emerging viral infections can provide a plan for the crisis management and prevention of emerging infections. This perspective article describes how an emerging viral infection evolves from microbial mutation, zoonotic and/or vector-borne transmission that progresses to a fatal infection due to overt viremia, tissue-specific cytotropic damage or/and immunopathology. We classified immunopathogenesis of common emerging viral infections into 4 categories: 1) deficient immunity with disseminated viremia (e.g., Ebola); 2) pneumocytotropism with/without later hyperinflammation (e.g., COVID-19); 3) augmented immunopathology (e.g., Hanta); and 4) antibody-dependent enhancement of infection with altered immunity (e.g., Dengue). A practical guide to early blocking of viral evasion, limiting viral load and identifying the fatal mechanism of an emerging viral infection is provided to prevent and reduce the transmission, and to do rapid diagnoses followed by the early treatment of virus neutralization for reduction of morbidity and mortality of an emerging viral infection such as COVID-19.

34284532	POST-COVID SYNDROME: PULMONARY COMPLICATIONS. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of people worlwide and caused a pandemic that is still ongoing. The virus can cause a disease named as COVID-19 which is composed of multi systemic manifestations with a pulmonary system predominance. As the time passes we are dealing more and more with the effects and complications of the disease in survivors which has shown a wide variety as far as concerns the clinical outcome and the timeline of symptoms in different patients. Since the lungs are the most involved organs and the post-COVID prolonged and persistent effects are mainly related to the pulmonary system it is crucial to define and predict the outcome and to determine the individuals that can progress to fibrosis and loss of function of lungs. This review summarizes the current literature regarding the pulmonary complications in post-COVID syndrome and the management of these conditions.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34285712	Possible Benefit of Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers in COVID-19 Patients: A Case Series. Introduction: Dysfunction in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is presumed that the effect of reducing interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels by angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) by RAAS modulation. We investigated changes in angiotensin II and IL-6 levels in four COVID-19 patients treated with ARBs. Case Presentation. Cases 1 and 2 were who had not received ARBs before and were newly administered ARBs. Case 3 restarted ARBs after discontinuation for 7 days, and case 4 received an increased dose of ARBs. The mean in angiotensin II levels (607.5 pg/mL, range: 488-850 pg/mL, reference range < 100 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (CRP) (10.58 mg/dL, range 4.45-18.05 mg/dL), and IL-6 (55.78 pg/mL, range: 12.86-144.82 pg/mL, reference range < 7 pg/mL) was observed at the admission in all patients. Upon clinical improvement, the mean decrease in CRP (1.02 mg/dL, range 0.06-3.78 mg/dL) and IL-6 (5.63 pg/mL, range 0.17-20.87 pg/mL) was observed in all patients. Conversely, angiotensin II levels gradually increased. Conclusion: This report supports the potential benefit of ARBs to improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients by controlling RAAS dysfunction.	Case Report
34208032	A Murine CD8(+) T Cell Epitope Identified in the Receptor-Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has posed a devastating threat worldwide. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is one of the most important antigens for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, while the analysis of CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in preclinical studies using mouse models is critical for evaluating vaccine efficacy. Here, we immunized C57BL/6 wild-type mice and transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein to evaluate the IFN-gamma-producing T cells in the splenocytes of the immunized mice using an overlapping peptide pool by an enzyme-linked immunospot assay and flow cytometry. We identified SARS-CoV-2 S395-404 as a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted epitope for the RBD-specific CD8 T cell responses in C57BL/6 mice.	Mechanism;Treatment
34291025	Exploring Feasibility of Multivariate Deep Learning Models in Predicting COVID-19 Epidemic. Background: Mathematical models are powerful tools to study COVID-19. However, one fundamental challenge in current modeling approaches is the lack of accurate and comprehensive data. Complex epidemiological systems such as COVID-19 are especially challenging to the commonly used mechanistic model when our understanding of this pandemic rapidly refreshes. Objective: We aim to develop a data-driven workflow to extract, process, and develop deep learning (DL) methods to model the COVID-19 epidemic. We provide an alternative modeling approach to complement the current mechanistic modeling paradigm. Method: We extensively searched, extracted, and annotated relevant datasets from over 60 official press releases in Hubei, China, in 2020. Multivariate long short-term memory (LSTM) models were developed with different architectures to track and predict multivariate COVID-19 time series for 1, 2, and 3 days ahead. As a comparison, univariate LSTMs were also developed to track new cases, total cases, and new deaths. Results: A comprehensive dataset with 10 variables was retrieved and processed for 125 days in Hubei. Multivariate LSTM had reasonably good predictability on new deaths, hospitalization of both severe and critical patients, total discharges, and total monitored in hospital. Multivariate LSTM showed better results for new and total cases, and new deaths for 1-day-ahead prediction than univariate counterparts, but not for 2-day and 3-day-ahead predictions. Besides, more complex LSTM architecture seemed not to increase overall predictability in this study. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of DL models to complement current mechanistic approaches when the exact epidemiological mechanisms are still under investigation.

34200372	ACE2-Independent Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein with Human Epithelial Cells Is Inhibited by Unfractionated Heparin. Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for COVID-19, depend on virus spike protein binding to host cell receptors to cause infection. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds primarily to ACE2 on target cells and is then processed by membrane proteases, including TMPRSS2, leading to viral internalisation or fusion with the plasma membrane. It has been suggested, however, that receptors other than ACE2 may be involved in virus binding. We have investigated the interactions of recombinant versions of the spike protein with human epithelial cell lines that express low/very low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a proxy assay for interaction with host cells. A tagged form of the spike protein containing the S1 and S2 regions bound in a temperature-dependent manner to all cell lines, whereas the S1 region alone and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) interacted only weakly. Spike protein associated with cells independently of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, while RBD required the presence of high levels of ACE2 for interaction. As the spike protein has previously been shown to bind heparin, a soluble glycosaminoglycan, we tested the effects of various heparins on ACE2-independent spike protein interaction with cells. Unfractionated heparin inhibited spike protein interaction with an IC50 value of <0.05 U/mL, whereas two low-molecular-weight heparins were less effective. A mutant form of the spike protein, lacking the arginine-rich putative furin cleavage site, interacted only weakly with cells and had a lower affinity for unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin than the wild-type spike protein. This suggests that the furin cleavage site might also be a heparin-binding site and potentially important for interactions with host cells. The glycosaminoglycans heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate, but not chondroitin sulphate, also inhibited the binding of spike protein, indicating that it might bind to one or both of these glycosaminoglycans on the surface of target cells.

34354677	Combining SARS-CoV-2 Proofreading Exonuclease and RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Inhibitors as a Strategy to Combat COVID-19: A High-Throughput in silico Screening. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of people worldwide. Currently, many clinical trials in search of effective COVID-19 drugs are underway. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) remains the target of choice for prophylactic or curative treatment of COVID-19. Nucleoside analogs are the most promising RdRp inhibitors and have shown effectiveness in vitro, as well as in clinical settings. One limitation of such RdRp inhibitors is the removal of incorporated nucleoside analogs by SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease (ExoN). Thus, ExoN proofreading activity accomplishes resistance to many of the RdRp inhibitors. We hypothesize that in the absence of highly efficient antivirals to treat COVID-19, combinatorial drug therapy with RdRp and ExoN inhibitors will be a promising strategy to combat the disease. To repurpose drugs for COVID-19 treatment, 10,397 conformers of 2,240 approved drugs were screened against the ExoN domain of nsp14 using AutoDock VINA. The molecular docking approach and detailed study of interactions helped us to identify dexamethasone metasulfobenzoate, conivaptan, hesperidin, and glycyrrhizic acid as potential inhibitors of ExoN activity. The results were further confirmed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular mechanics combined with generalized Born model and solvent accessibility method (MM-GBSA) calculations. Furthermore, the binding free energy of conivaptan and hesperidin, estimated using MM-GBSA, was -85.86 +/- 0.68 and 119.07 +/- 0.69 kcal/mol, respectively. Based on docking, MD simulations and known antiviral activities, and conivaptan and hesperidin were identified as potential SARS-CoV-2 ExoN inhibitors. We recommend further investigation of this combinational therapy using RdRp inhibitors with a repurposed ExoN inhibitor as a potential COVID-19 treatment.	Mechanism;Treatment
34339514	The seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Delhi, India: a repeated population-based seroepidemiological study. BACKGROUND: Three rounds of a repeated cross-sectional serosurvey to estimate the change in seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were conducted from August to October 2020 in the state of Delhi, India, in the general population >/=5 y of age. METHODS: The selection of participants was through a multistage sampling design from all 11 districts and 280 wards of the city-state, with multistage allocation proportional to population size. The blood samples were screened using immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. RESULTS: We observed a total of 4267 (N=150 46), 4311 (N=17 409) and 3829 (N=15 015) positive tests indicative of the presence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 during the August, September and October 2020 serosurvey rounds, respectively. The adjusted seroprevalence declined from 28.39% (95% confidence interval [CI] 27.65 to 29.14) in August to 24.08% (95% CI 23.43 to 24.74) in September and 24.71% (95% CI 24.01 to 25.42) in October. On adjusted analysis, participants with lower per capita income, living in slums or overcrowded households and those with diabetes comorbidity had significantly higher statistical odds of having antibody positivity (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one in four residents in Delhi, India >/=5 y of age had the SARS-CoV-2 infection during August-October 2020.	Diagnosis
34228851	Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis. We estimated the seroprevalence of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in residents of African countries and explored its associated factors. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, CINAHL, DOAJ and Google Scholar databases for peer reviewed articles and pre-prints that reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence of general or specific human populations resident in Africa. The eligible studies were evaluated using Joana Briggs Institute prevalence critical appraisal tool. Twenty-three studies involving 27,735 individuals were included in our paper. The pooled seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Africa was 22% (95%CI: 14-31) with very high heterogeneity (I(2) = 100%, p < 0.001). Seroprevalence was highest in studies conducted in Central Africa compared to Southern Africa, West Africa, North Africa and East Africa respectively. The number of days between the first reported coronavirus disease 2019 case in each country and when a seroprevalence study was conducted was a significant moderator of seroprevalence. Seropositivity was numerically influenced by gender and age of the participants with males and those aged below 50 years being most affected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The highest pooled seroprevalence in Africa reported in this review should be interpreted cautiously due to high heterogeneity between studies. Continued seroprevalence surveillance is warranted to establish Africa's transition towards herd immunity.	Diagnosis
34293134	Is SARS-CoV-2 infection a risk factor for early pregnancy loss? ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression and persistent replicative infection in primitive trophoblast. BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection in term placenta is relatively rare. However, growing evidence suggests that susceptibility of the human placenta to infection may vary by gestational age and pathogen. For several viral infections, susceptibility appears to be greatest during early gestation. Infections of the peri-implantation placenta that result in pre-clinical pregnancy loss would typically go undetected. Little is known about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the peri-implantation human placenta since this time in pregnancy can only be modeled in vitro. METHODS: We used a human embryonic stem cell-derived model of peri-implantation placental development to assess patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcription and protein expression in primitive trophoblast. These molecules are involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and infection. We then infected the same trophoblast cell model with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, and documented infection dynamics. RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were transcribed and translated in stem-cell derived trophoblast, with preferential expression in syncytialized cells. These same syncytialized cells supported replicative and persistent infection by SARS-CoV-2, while non-syncytialized trophoblast cells in the same cultures did not. CONCLUSIONS: Co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in early human embryonic stem cell-derived trophoblast and the robust and replicative infection limited to syncytiotrophoblast equivalents support the hypothesis that increased viral susceptibility may be a defining characteristic of primitive trophoblast. Potential implications of these findings for early pregnancy loss deserve further investigation.	Mechanism;Treatment
34289037	Emerging neurotropic features of SARS-CoV-2. The prevailing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has presented some neurological manifestations including hyposmia, hypogeusia, headache, stroke, encephalitis, GuillainBarre syndrome, and some neuropsychiatric disorders. Although several cell types in the brain express angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the main SARS-CoV-2 receptor, and other related proteins, it remains unclear whether the observed neurological manifestations are attributed to virus invasion into the brain or just comorbidities caused by dysregulation of systemic factors. Here, we briefly review the neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, summarize recent evidence for the potential neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, and discuss the potential mechanisms of COVID-19-associated neurological diseases.

34281603	Single-nucleus transcriptome analysis of human brain immune response in patients with severe COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has been associated with neurological and neuropsychiatric illness in many individuals. We sought to further our understanding of the relationship between brain tropism, neuro-inflammation, and host immune response in acute COVID-19 cases. METHODS: Three brain regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medulla oblongata, and choroid plexus) from 5 patients with severe COVID-19 and 4 controls were examined. The presence of the virus was assessed by western blot against viral spike protein, as well as viral transcriptome analysis covering > 99% of SARS-CoV-2 genome and all potential serotypes. Droplet-based single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed in the same samples to examine the impact of COVID-19 on transcription in individual cells of the brain. RESULTS: Quantification of viral spike S1 protein and viral transcripts did not detect SARS-CoV-2 in the postmortem brain tissue. However, analysis of 68,557 single-nucleus transcriptomes from three distinct regions of the brain identified an increased proportion of stromal cells, monocytes, and macrophages in the choroid plexus of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, differential gene expression, pseudo-temporal trajectory, and gene regulatory network analyses revealed transcriptional changes in the cortical microglia associated with a range of biological processes, including cellular activation, mobility, and phagocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 in the brain at the time of death, the findings suggest significant and persistent neuroinflammation in patients with acute COVID-19.

34224078	SARS-CoV-2 seroepidemiological study in healthcare workers and discordant results using seven different diagnostic methods. The aim of the study was to access the SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in healthcare workers (HCWs) of a tertiary pediatric hospital after the first wave of the pandemic and to compare the results among seven commercially available antibody detection assays, including chemiluminescence (CMIA), electroluminescence (ECLIA), Epsilonnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and rapid immunochromatography (RIC). SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection was performed in serum samples of 1216 HCWs, using a reference CMIA assay and 8/1216 (0.66%) were detected positive. Positive serum samples were further tested with other assays; however, only one sample was positive by all tests. The rest 7 cases were negative with ECLIA and ELISA and gave discordant results with RIC test. Six months later, new serum samples of seropositive HCWs were analyzed with the same 7 tests, with inconsistent results again. Identification of reliable SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests is important to determine the actual number of past infections, the duration of antibodies, and guide public health decisions.	Diagnosis
34226206	Clinical phenotypes and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, RSV and seven other respiratory viruses: a retrospective study using complete hospital data. BACKGROUND: An understanding of differences in clinical phenotypes and outcomes COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viral infections is important to optimise the management of patients and plan healthcare. Herein we sought to investigate such differences in patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other respiratory viruses. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalised adults and children (</=15 years) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus A/B, RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza viruses, metapneumovirus, seasonal coronaviruses, adenovirus or bocavirus in a respiratory sample at admission between 2011 and 2020. RESULTS: A total of 6321 adult (1721 SARS-CoV-2) and 6379 paediatric (101 SARS-CoV-2) healthcare episodes were included in the study. In adults, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was independently associated with younger age, male sex, overweight/obesity, diabetes and hypertension, tachypnoea as well as better haemodynamic measurements, white cell count, platelet count and creatinine values. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 was associated with higher 30-day mortality as compared with influenza (adjusted HR (aHR) 4.43, 95% CI 3.51 to 5.59), RSV (aHR 3.81, 95% CI 2.72 to 5.34) and other respiratory viruses (aHR 3.46, 95% CI 2.61 to 4.60), as well as higher 90-day mortality, ICU admission, ICU mortality and pulmonary embolism in adults. In children, patients with SARS-CoV-2 were older and had lower prevalence of chronic cardiac and respiratory diseases compared with other viruses. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is associated with more severe outcomes compared with other respiratory viruses, and although associated with specific patient and clinical characteristics at admission, a substantial overlap precludes discrimination based on these characteristics.

34281512	"Knowledge and attitude on prevention of COVID-19 among community health workers in Nepal-a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: Emerging and reemerging pathogens are global challenges for public health and the pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019is a reemerging case of an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corornavirus-2. Health care worker worldwide are at higher risk worldwide and the situation is the same in Nepal. The knowledge and attitude of health workers will certainly mark the outcome towards this pandemic. So, this study aims to assess the knowledge and attitude of community health workers towards the prevention of COVID-19 virus. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among the community health workers of various provinces of Nepal. A semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire was prepared in Google form and circulated to the sampled health workers through various social media platforms like face book, messenger, Instagram and g-mails. A total of 650 invitations were send and among them 420 responded and among them only 399 provided complete response. Responses containing anonymized data was collected analyzed in using SPSS-version-20. The results were interpreted and was checked with various demographic and enabling factors using chi-square test and logistic regression model. Also, ethical approval was taken from NHRC (Nepal Health Research Council (protocol registration number: 360/2020P) prior to the conduction of study. RESULTS: Out the total sample size of 450, we took 399 responses taking into consideration all the inclusion criteria. So, from 399 valid response, 230 (47.6%) were males and 169 (42.4%) were females. 380 (95.2%) employed participants thought that wearing PPE will reduce the chances of getting COVID-19, majority of the participants 80.5% (321) responded that COVID-19 will successfully be controlled and staffs receiving excellent support from palika had high knowledge level. Knowledge level was significantly associated with the enabling factor ""support from palika"" (P = 0.045).45.9% of the respondents had no availability of COVID-19 response medical items for prevention of COVID-19 at their respective health facilities. Also the logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of knowledge level was 2 times higher (AOR=1.913 at 95% CI: 1.266-2.891) compared to the female participants (Ref- female). CONCLUSIONS: Proper and adequate knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 is a paramount in the prevention and control of SARS-COV-2. Health care workers are knowledgeable about COVID-19 and are proactively practicing the preventive measures to minimize the spread of infection but some lack optimistic attitude. Hence, the constantly updated educational programs related to COVID-19 will surely contribute to improving the healthcare workers knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19."	Prevention
34222613	Statistical study on the impact of different meteorological changes on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt and its latitude. Abstract: More than 1 million illnesses and 70,000 deaths were reported due to novel COVID-19 by the end of the first quarter of 2020. In April 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The striking resemblance between COVID-19 and its forerunners SARS and MERS, as well as earlier findings on the impact of meteorological conditions on the spread of SARS and MERS, prompted researchers to investigate the relationship between meteorological conditions and the spread of COVID-19. In this work, we statistically studied the effect of different meteorological parameters such as average temperature, humidity, dew point, and wind speed on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt and its latitude (Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey). Our findings revealed that there is a correlation between several meteorological parameters and the spread of COVID-19, but that, contrary to popular belief, the virus does not disappear when the temperature rises. Our theory is that either the virus became active in Egypt and its latitude as the temperature rose, or the humidity became unstable when the temperature rose during the summer season. A log-linear quasi-Poisson regression model was used to estimate the relationship between the studied metrological parameters and the spread of COVID-19. The findings of the study will have ramifications for future control and prevention efforts in Egypt and its latitude. Graphic abstract:	Prevention;Transmission

This study aimed to evaluate the cardiometabolic effects of a home-based lifestyle intervention (LI) in breast cancer survivors (BCSs) during the COVID-19 lockdown. In total, 30 BCSs (women; stages 0-II; non-metastatic; aged 53.5 +/- 7.6 years; non-physically active; normal left ventricular systolic function) with a risk factor for recurrence underwent a 3-month LI based on nutrition and exercise. Anthropometrics, Mediterranean diet adherence, physical activity level (PAL), cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), echocardiographic parameters, heart rate variability (average standard deviation of NN intervals (ASDNN/5 min) and 24 h very- (24 hVLF) and low-frequency (24 hLF)), and metabolic, endocrine, and inflammatory serum biomarkers (glycemia, insulin resistance, progesterone, testosterone, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)) were evaluated before (T0) and after (T1) the LI. After the LI, there were improvements in: body mass index (kg/m(2): T0 = 26.0 +/- 5.0, T1 = 25.5 +/- 4.7; p = 0.035); diet (Mediet score: T0 = 6.9 +/- 2.3, T1 = 8.8 +/- 2.2; p < 0.001); PAL (MET-min/week: T0 = 647 +/- 547, T1 = 1043 +/- 564; p < 0.001); VO2max (mL.min(-1).kg(-1): T0 = 30.5 +/- 5.8, T1 = 33.4 +/- 6.8; p < 0.001); signs of diastolic dysfunction (participants: T0 = 15, T1 = 10; p = 0.007); AS-DNN/5 min (ms: T0 = 50.6 +/- 14.4, T1 = 55.3 +/- 16.7; p = 0.032); 24 hLF (ms(2): T0 = 589 +/- 391, T1 = 732 +/- 542; p = 0.014); glycemia (mg/dL: T0 = 100.8 +/- 11.4, T1 = 91.7 +/- 11.0; p < 0.001); insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score: T0 = 2.07 +/- 1.54, T1 = 1.53 +/- 1.11; p = 0.005); testosterone (ng/mL: T0 = 0.34 +/- 0.27, T1 = 0.24 +/- 0.20; p = 0.003); hs-CRP (mg/L: T0 = 2.18 +/- 2.14, T1 = 1.75 +/- 1.74; p = 0.027). The other parameters did not change. Despite the home-confinement, LI based on exercise and nutrition improved cardiometabolic health in BCSs.	Prevention
34350391	Overcoming gaps: regional collaborative to optimize capacity management and predict length of stay of patients admitted with COVID-19. Objective: Ensuring an efficient response to COVID-19 requires a degree of inter-system coordination and capacity management coupled with an accurate assessment of hospital utilization including length of stay (LOS). We aimed to establish optimal practices in inter-system data sharing and LOS modeling to support patient care and regional hospital operations. Materials and Methods: We completed a retrospective observational study of patients admitted with COVID-19 followed by 12-week prospective validation, involving 36 hospitals covering the upper Midwest. We developed a method for sharing de-identified patient data across systems for analysis. From this, we compared 3 approaches, generalized linear model (GLM) and random forest (RF), and aggregated system level averages to identify features associated with LOS. We compared model performance by area under the ROC curve (AUROC). Results: A total of 2068 patients were included and used for model derivation and 597 patients for validation. LOS overall had a median of 5.0 days and mean of 8.2 days. Consistent predictors of LOS included age, critical illness, oxygen requirement, weight loss, and nursing home admission. In the validation cohort, the RF model (AUROC 0.890) and GLM model (AUROC 0.864) achieved good to excellent prediction of LOS, but only marginally better than system averages in practice. Conclusion: Regional sharing of patient data allowed for effective prediction of LOS across systems; however, this only provided marginal improvement over hospital averages at the aggregate level. A federated approach of sharing aggregated system capacity and average LOS will likely allow for effective capacity management at the regional level.	Prevention
34374354	Prevalence of a Single-Nucleotide Variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Korea and Its Impact on the Diagnostic Sensitivity of the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 Assay. The sensitivity of molecular diagnostics could be affected by nucleotide variants in pathogen genes, and the sites affected by such variants should be monitored. We report a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), i.e., G29179T, which impairs the diagnostic sensitivity of the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). We observed significant differences between the threshold cycle (Ct) values for envelope (E) and N genes and confirmed the SNV as the cause of the differences using Sanger sequencing. This SNV, G29179T, is the most prevalent in Korea and is associated with the B.1.497 virus lineage, which is dominant in Korea. Clinical laboratories should be aware of the various SNVs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and consider their potential effects on the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
34219863	Stay at Home! Governance Quality and Effectiveness of Lockdown. In order to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, during the first wave of the pandemic numerous countries decided to adopt lockdown policies. It had been a considerable time since such measures were last introduced, and the first time that they were implemented on such a global scale in a contemporary, information intensive society. The effectiveness of such measures may depend on how citizens perceive the capacity of government to set up and implement sound policies. Indeed, lockdown and confinement policies in general are binding measures that people are not used to, and which raise serious concerns among the population. For this reason governance quality could affect the perception of the benefits related to the government's choice to impose lockdown, making citizens more inclined to accept it and restrict their movements. In the present paper we empirically investigate the relation between the efficacy of lockdown and governance quality (measured through World Governance Indicators). Our results suggest that countries with higher levels of government effectiveness, rule of law and regulatory quality reach better results in adopting lockdown measures.

34220344	Do liberals want curbside pickup more than conservatives? Contactless shopping as protectionary action against the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumers showed a dramatically increased interest in contactless shopping in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the protection motivation theory, this study investigated how contactless shopping grew as a protectionary action against COVID-19. Findings from a nationwide online survey (n = 311) confirmed the impact of politicization of the pandemic on consumer responses for contactless shopping intention and the significance of threat and coping appraisals in taking protectionary actions. This study adds knowledge to the existing literature on contactless shopping and protection motivation theory. Results imply that retailers must invest in contactless shopping and provide an in-store shopping environment that prioritizes the health and safety of shoppers and employees to decrease the threat of virus infection during shopping. However, in doing so, retailers are recommended to develop different marketing strategies regarding contactless shopping based on consumers' political orientations.	Prevention

BACKGROUND: Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a clinical syndrome characterized by a temporary short-term memory loss with inability to retain new memories, usually lasting 2 to 8 h. TGA may be related to several medical procedures, including angiography, general anesthesia, gastroscopy. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 58-year-old woman who experiencing TGA one hour after the execution of her first-time nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19. Brain MRI showed a typical punctate Diffusion Weight Image (DWI) hippocampal lesion. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of TGA after the execution of nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19. This association lengthen the list of medical procedures associated with TGA, and we discuss the possible plausible mechanisms by which a nasopharyngeal swab could trigger TGA."	Case Report
34290917	Possible Vertical Transmission From an Unsuspected SARS-CoV-2-Infected Mother to Her Newborn. Although the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been found to have multiple routes of transmission, limited data exist on whether the vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can occur from asymptomatic infected mothers to their newborns during pregnancy. We report a full-term newborn girl who was found to be positive for COVID-19 at 24 hours of life and subsequently symptomatic with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and elevated total bilirubin. The newborn was delivered by a mother who was not suspected of having COVID-19 before giving birth, but who developed fever and dyspnea five hours after delivery and was found to be positive for COVID-19. Upon further history collection, the mother reported recent mild nasal congestion in the days prior to delivery. This case highlights that the vertical transmission of COVID-19 to a newborn may occur late during the third trimester from a mother who was not suspected of having the infection. All pregnant women may need to be screened for COVID-19 symptoms, including non-specific symptoms, prior to admission for labor and delivery floors in order to perform diagnostic tests and recommended safety precautions to keep newborns and hospital personnel safe.

BACKGROUND: Vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) following the administration of the AstraZeneca (AZ) ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 vaccine has recently been reported. The associated clinical and laboratory features have included thrombosis at unusual sites, thrombocytopenia, and raised D-dimers with positivity for IgG anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies. OBJECTIVES: A UK National External Quality Control Assessment Scheme external quality control exercise was carried out by distributing liquid and lyophilized samples from a subject with VITT, a pool of samples from subjects with classical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and a non-VITT/non-HIT case to 85 centers performing HIT testing. METHODS: Participating centers employed their locally validated testing methods for HIT assays. RESULTS: The lyophilized and liquid samples were found to be commutable for the ELISA assays used in the detection of anti-PF4 antibodies. The Aeskulisa, Stago, Hyphen, and LIFECODES anti-PF4 ELISA assays successfully detected the VITT antibody, whereas the Acustar HIT, Werfen LIA, and the Stago STIC assays did not. CONCLUSION: It is important that clinical and laboratory teams are aware of the limitations of some anti-PF4 assays when using them to aid diagnosis of VITT syndrome.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34224882	Predictors of Telemedicine Utilization in a Pediatric Neurosurgical Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic. OBJECTIVE: In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has become rapidly adopted by the neurosurgical community; however, few studies have examined predictors of telemedicine utilization. Here, we analyze patient variables associated with the acceptance of a telemedicine encounter by a pediatric neurosurgical population during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: All patients seen in a single institution's outpatient pediatric neurosurgery clinic between April 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic variables were collected for each patient's first completed encounter. Patients participating in telemedicine were compared with those seen in person. Univariate analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and Fischer exact test for categorical variables. A logistic regression multivariable analysis was then performed. RESULTS: We included 682 patients (374 telemedicine and 308 in person). Univariate analysis demonstrated that telemedicine visits were more likely to occur at earlier study dates (P < 0.001) and that patients participating in telemedicine visits were more likely to be established rather than new patients (P < 0.001), White or Caucasian (P < 0.001), not Hispanic or Latino (P < 0.001), English-speaking (P < 0.001), non-Medicare/Medicaid recipients (P < 0.001), have lower no-show rates (P = 0.006), and live farther from the hospital (P = 0.005). Multivariable analysis demonstrated older age (P = 0.031), earlier appointment date (P < 0.01), established patient status (P < 0.001), English-speaking (P < 0.02), and non-Medicare/Medicaid insurance (P < 0.05) were significant predictors of telemedicine utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Significant demographic differences exist among pediatric patients who participated in telemedicine versus those who requested an in-person visit at our institution. Addressing barriers to access will be crucial for promoting health equity in continued utilization of telemedicine.	Prevention
34221639	"Role of Chest CT in COVID-19. In December 2019, a disease attributed to a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), broke out in Wuhan, China and has spread rapidly throughout the world. CT has been advocated in selected indications as a tool toward rapid and early diagnosis. The CT patterns of COVID-19 include ground glass opacities GGO, consolidation, and crazy paving. Additional signs include a ""rounded morphology"" of lesions, vascular enlargement sign, nodules, and fibrous stripe. Signs of healing and organization include subpleural bands, a reticular pattern, reversed halo sign and traction bronchiectasis. Cavitation and tree in bud signs are absent and pleural effusions are rare. There is a high incidence of pulmonary embolism associated with COVID-19. CT findings in COVID-19 appear to follow a predictable timeline with maximal involvement approximately 6-11 days after symptom onset. The stages of evolution include early stage (days 0-4) with GGO being the predominant abnormality, progressive stage (days 5-8) with increasing crazy paving; and peak stage (days 9-13) with predominance of consolidation and absorption phase (after day 14) with gradual absorption of consolidation with residual GGO and subpleural bands. CT findings in COVID-19 have a high sensitivity and low specificity, determined to be 98% and 25% in a retrospective study of 1014 patients. The low specificity of CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia is due to the overlap of CT findings with other viral pneumonias and other infections, lung involvement in connective tissue disorders, drug reaction, pulmonary edema, and hemorrhage."

34229274	A mass spectrometry-based targeted assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen from clinical specimens. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has overwhelmed health systems worldwide and highlighted limitations of diagnostic testing. Several types of diagnostic tests including RT-PCR-based assays and antigen detection by lateral flow assays, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, have been developed and deployed in a short time. METHODS: Here, we describe an immunoaffinity purification approach followed a by high resolution mass spectrometry-based targeted qualitative assay capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen from nasopharyngeal swab samples. Based on our discovery experiments using purified virus, recombinant viral protein and nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 positive patients, nucleocapsid protein was selected as a target antigen. We then developed an automated antibody capture-based workflow coupled to targeted high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) - parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assay on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. An ensemble machine learning-based model for determining COVID-19 positive samples was developed using fragment ion intensities from the PRM data. FINDINGS: The optimized targeted assay, which was used to analyze 88 positive and 88 negative nasopharyngeal swab samples for validation, resulted in 98% (95% CI = 0.922-0.997) (86/88) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI = 0.958-1.000) (88/88) specificity using RT-PCR-based molecular testing as the reference method. INTERPRETATION: Our results demonstrate that direct detection of infectious agents from clinical samples by tandem mass spectrometry-based assays have potential to be deployed as diagnostic assays in clinical laboratories, which has hitherto been limited to analysis of pure microbial cultures. FUNDING: This study was supported by DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance Margdarshi Fellowship grant IA/M/15/1/502023 awarded to AP and the generosity of Eric and Wendy Schmidt.	Diagnosis
34370958	Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome during convalescence from COVID-19. A 61-year-old woman with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) confirmed by nasopharyngeal real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) required invasive mechanical ventilation 24-hours after admission. During her intensive care unit stay, she developed transient acute kidney injury and septic shock. She was extubated after 22 days. On day 25, she developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed bilateral subcortical lesions on the parietal and occipital lobes and multiple micro-and macro-bleeds, consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). At this point, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in a respiratory specimen and cerebrospinal fluid was negative. She was discharged home 35 days after admission on oral levetiracetam. Control MRI five months after discharge showed bilateral focal gliosis. On follow-up, she remains seizure-free on levetiracetam.PRES has been observed before as a neurological manifestation of acute COVID-19; to our knowledge, this is the first PRES case occurring in a hospitalized patient already recovered from COVID-19. A persistent proinflammatory/prothrombotic state triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to long-standing endothelial dysfunction, resulting in delayed PRES in patients recovering from COVID-19. With a rapid and exponential increase in survivors of acute COVID-19, clinicians should be aware of delayed (post-acute) neurological damage, including PRES.	Case Report
34373176	Serial quantitative chest computed tomography imaging as prognosticators of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. In 2019, a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in China. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively analyze the evolution of chest computed tomography (CT) imaging features in COVID-19. Nine patients with positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results were included in this study. Totally 19 CT scans were analyzed. Lesion density, lesion volume, and lesion load were higher in the severe group than in the mild group. A significantly positive correlation was noted between major laboratory prognosticators with lesion volume and load. Lesion load at the first week of disease was significantly higher in severe group (p = 0.03). Our study revealed that several CT features were significantly different between severely and mildly infected forms of COVID-19 pneumonia. The CT lesion load value at the first week of infection may be applied as an outcome predictor of the disease.	Diagnosis
34199795	The Impact of COVID-19 on Admissions and Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Episodes in the Emergency Department. BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of admissions to the emergency department (ED) due to a primary diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) has decreased when compared to pre-pandemic times. The principal aim of the study was to assess the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infections and sinus rhythm restoration among patients who arrived at the ED with AF. Secondary aims included determining whether patients arriving at the ED principally due to AF delayed their presentations and whether the frequency of successful cardioversion for AF was decreased during the pandemic period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of medical records of patients admitted to two hospital EDs due to AF during July-December 2019 (pre-pandemic period) versus July-December 2020 (pandemic period) was performed. RESULTS: During the study periods, 601 ED visits by 497 patients were made due to the primary diagnosis of AF. The patients were aged 71.2+/-13.5 years and 51.3% were male. The duration of an AF episode before the ED admission was 10 h (4.5-30 h) during the pandemic period vs. 5 h (3-24 h) during the non-pandemic period (p = 0.001). A shorter duration of the AF episode before ED admission was associated with the successful restoration of the sinus rhythm. During the pandemic period, among patients with short-lasting AF who were not treated with Phenazolinum, the restoration of the sinus rhythm was more frequent in the Copernicus Memorial Hospital than in the University Hospital (p = 0.026). A positive SARS-CoV-2 test was found in 5 (1%) patients, while 2 other patients (0.5%) had a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 disease noted in their medical history. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The number of AF episodes treated in these two EDs was lower during the pandemic than non-pandemic period. 2. The patients with AF appeared at the ED later after AF onset in the pandemic period. 3. Successful cardioversion of atrial fibrillation was more frequent during the pre-pandemic period in one of the two hospitals. 4. A difference of approaches to the treatment of short-lasting AF episodes between EDs during the pandemic period may exist between these two EDs. 5. The patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic constituted a small percentage of the patients admitted to EDs due to an AF episode.	Prevention

34203463	A Pilot Study on Covid and Autism: Prevalence, Clinical Presentation and Vaccine Side Effects. Background: Several neurobiological mechanisms have been proposed to support the hypothesis of a higher COVID-19 risk in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, no real-world data are available on this population. Methods: We compared the period prevalence (March-May 2020) and symptom presentation of COVID-19 infections between a sample of individuals with severe ASD (n = 36) and the staff personnel (n = 35) of two specialized centers. Anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibody positivity was used as a proxy of infection. Additionally, we evaluated vaccine side effects in the same groups. Results: No significant difference was found between the prevalence of COVID-19 positivity between autistic participants and staff personnel. Levels of antibodies against the spike protein and the receptor binding domain were not significantly different between autistic and staff participants. The level of antibodies against the N-terminal domain were higher in autistic individuals. There was a significant difference between the prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 in autistic participants (9.1%) compared to staff personnel (92.3%). The most frequent side effect among autistic participants was light fever. Conclusions: The present study provides preliminary data on COVID-19 transmission and presentation in ASD. Our data do not support the hypothesis of a higher susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in people with ASD.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34227468	Mendelian randomization analysis provides causality of smoking on the expression of ACE2, a putative SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Background: To understand a causal role of modifiable lifestyle factors in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression (a putative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] receptor) across 44 human tissues/organs, and in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility and severity, we conducted a phenome-wide two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Methods: More than 500 genetic variants were used as instrumental variables to predict smoking and alcohol consumption. Inverse-variance weighted approach was adopted as the primary method to estimate a causal association, while MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) were performed to identify potential horizontal pleiotropy. Results: We found that genetically predicted smoking intensity significantly increased ACE2 expression in thyroid (beta=1.468, p=1.8x10(-8)), and increased ACE2 expression in adipose, brain, colon, and liver with nominal significance. Additionally, genetically predicted smoking initiation significantly increased the risk of COVID-19 onset (odds ratio=1.14, p=8.7x10(-5)). No statistically significant result was observed for alcohol consumption. Conclusions: Our work demonstrates an important role of smoking, measured by both status and intensity, in the susceptibility to COVID-19.

34292445	The Number of Syncytial Knots and VEGF Expression in Placental Villi in Parturient Woman with COVID-19 Depends on the Disease Severity. A comparative morphological study was carried out to analyze the number of syncytial knots and VEGF expression in placental villi in parturient women with COVID-19 categorized by the disease severity. The number of syncytial knots was assessed on specimens stained with hematoxylin and eosin. VEGF expression was determined by immunohistochemical analysis in syncytiotrophoblast and villous endothelial cells. Morphological study of the placenta tissue of parturient women with COVID-19 showed increased numbers of syncytial knots in the villi, indicating the development of preplacental hypoxia. High VEGF expression in syncytiotrophoblast and vascular endotheliocytes reflects a stereotyped response to hypoxia and can underlie the development of a preeclampsia-like syndrome. The number of syncytial knots and VEGF expression in placental villi in parturient women with COVID-19 depended on the disease severity.	Treatment;Diagnosis;Mechanism
34202882	Saliva Molecular Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance in Two Italian Primary Schools. BACKGROUND: No evidence has so far proven a significant role of schools in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, while the negative effects of their closure on children and adolescents are well documented. Surveillance, by means of frequent students and staff testing, has been advocated in order to implement school safety. Our aim was to report the results of a school surveillance program for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre- and asymptomatic subjects, by means of molecular salivary testing (MST). METHODS: School surveillance in two schools in Milan, Italy, was carried out for six weeks. Each participant received a saliva collection kit, to be self-performed. RESULTS: 401 students and 12 teachers were enrolled, and 5 positive children in 5 different classes were observed. All the cases were asymptomatic. Their nasopharyngeal swab was positive on the same day in four cases, while in one case it resulted negative on the same day and positive 3 days later. In one positive case, the whole family was set under surveillance. The positive child did not develop symptoms and no family member was infected. CONCLUSIONS: MST might represent an efficient way to actively survey communities in order to detect asymptomatic cases, thus limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34338417	Psychosocial interventions for improving engagement in care and health and behavioural outcomes for adolescents and young people living with HIV: a systematic review and meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: Adolescents and young people comprise a growing proportion of new HIV infections globally, yet current approaches do not effectively engage this group, and adolescent HIV-related outcomes are the poorest among all age groups. Providing psychosocial interventions incorporating psychological, social, and/or behavioural approaches offer a potential pathway to improve engagement in care and health and behavioural outcomes among adolescents and young people living with HIV (AYPLHIV). METHODS: A systematic search of all peer-reviewed papers published between January 2000 and July 2020 was conducted through four electronic databases (Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus). We included randomized controlled trials evaluating psychosocial interventions aimed at improving engagement in care and health and behavioural outcomes of AYPLHIV aged 10 to 24 years. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Thirty relevant studies were identified. Studies took place in the United States (n = 18, 60%), sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe) and Southeast Asia (Thailand). Outcomes of interest included adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), ART knowledge, viral load data, sexual risk behaviours, sexual risk knowledge, retention in care and linkage to care. Overall, psychosocial interventions for AYPLHIV showed important, small-to-moderate effects on adherence to ART (SMD = 0.3907, 95% CI: 0.1059 to 0.6754, 21 studies, n = 2647) and viral load (SMD = -0.2607, 95% CI -04518 to -0.0696, 12 studies, n = 1566). The psychosocial interventions reviewed did not demonstrate significant impacts on retention in care (n = 8), sexual risk behaviours and knowledge (n = 13), viral suppression (n = 4), undetectable viral load (n = 5) or linkage to care (n = 1) among AYPLHIV. No studies measured transition to adult services. Effective interventions employed various approaches, including digital and lay health worker delivery, which hold promise for scaling interventions in the context of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the potential of psychosocial interventions in improving health outcomes in AYPLHIV. However, more research needs to be conducted on interventions that can effectively reduce sexual risk behaviours of AYPLHIV, as well as those that can strengthen engagement in care. Further investment is needed to ensure that these interventions are cost-effective, sustainable and resilient in the face of resource constraints and global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

34333010	The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in hospital: An insight into environmental surfaces contamination, disinfectants' efficiency, and estimation of plastic waste production. The current COVID-19 pandemic that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led all the people around the globe to implement preventive measures such as environmental cleaning using alcohol-based materials, and social distancing in order to prevent and minimize viral transmission via fomites. The role of environmental surface contamination in viral transmission in within hospital wards is still debatable, especially considering the spread of new variants of the virus in the world. The present comprehensive study aims to investigate environmental surface contamination in different wards of a hospital as well as the efficacy of two common disinfectants for virus inactivation, and tries to produce an estimate of plastic residue pollution as an environmental side effect of the pandemic. With regard to environmental surface contamination, 76 samples were taken from different wards of the hospital, from which 40 were positive. These samples were taken from contaminated environmental surfaces such as patient bed handles, the nursing station, toilet door handles, cell phones, patient toilet sinks, toilet bowls, and patient's pillows, which are regularly-touched surfaces and can pose a high risk for transmission of the virus. The number of positive samples also reveals that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on inanimate surfaces after disinfection by ethanol 70 % and sodium hypochlorite (0.001 %). The results correspond to the time that the VOC 202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7) had emerged in the hospital and this should be considered that this variant could possibly have different traits, characteristics, and level of persistence in the environment. The plastic waste as an environmental side effect of the pandemic was also investigated and it was confirmed that the amount of plastic residue for a single (RT) PCR confirmatory test for COVID-19 diagnosis is 821.778 g of plastic residue/test. As a result, it is recommended that for improving plastic waste management programs, considering challenges such as minimizing plastic waste pollution, optimization of gas control technologies in incinerators, process redesign, reduction of single-use plastics and PPE, etc. Is of utmost importance.

34222046	SARS-CoV-2: Origin, Evolution, and Targeting Inhibition. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an outbreak in Wuhan city, China and quickly spread worldwide. Currently, there are no specific drugs or antibodies that claim to cure severe acute respiratory diseases. For SARS-CoV-2, the spike (S) protein recognizes and binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, allowing viral RNA to enter the host cell. The main protease (Mpro) is involved in the proteolytic process for mature non-structural proteins, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is responsible for the viral genome replication and transcription processes. Owing to the pivotal physiological roles in viral invasion and replication, S protein, Mpro, RdRp are regarded as the main therapeutic targets for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we carried out an evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with other mammal-infecting coronaviruses that have sprung up in the past few decades and described the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. We displayed the structural details of S protein, Mpro, and RdRp, as well as their complex structures with different chemical inhibitors or antibodies. Structural comparisons showed that some neutralizing antibodies and small molecule inhibitors could inhibit S protein, Mpro, or RdRp. Moreover, we analyzed the structural differences between SARS-CoV-2 ancestral S protein and D614G mutant, which led to a second wave of infection during the recent pandemic. In this context, we outline the methods that might potentially help cure COVID-19 and provide a summary of effective chemical molecules and neutralizing antibodies.	Mechanism;Treatment
34221822	Use of nanotechnology in combating coronavirus. Recent COVID-19 pandemic situation caused due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affected global health as well as economics. There is global attention on prevention, diagnosis as well as treatment of COVID-19 infection which would help in easing the current situation. The use of nanotechnology and nanomedicine has been considered to be promising due to its excellent potential in managing various medical issues such as viruses which is a major threat. Nanoparticles have shown great potential in various biomedical applications and can prove to be of great use in antiviral therapy, especially over other conventional antiviral agents. This review focusses on the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and the progression of the COVID-19 disease followed by currently available treatments for the same. Use of nanotechnology has been elaborated by exploiting various nanoparticles like metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, carbon-based nanoparticles, quantum dots, polymeric nanoparticles as well as lipid-based nanoparticles along with its mechanism of action against viruses which can prove to be beneficial in COVID-19 therapeutics. However, it needs to be considered that use of these nanotechnology-based approaches in COVID-19 therapeutics only aids the human immunity in fighting the infection. The main function is performed by the immune system in combatting any infection.	Diagnosis;Treatment;Mechanism
34288728	Multicentre post-implementation assessment of the positive-predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-based point-of-care tests used for asymptomatic screening of continuing care staff. Frequent screening of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic populations using antigen-based point of care tests (APOCT) is occurring globally with limited clinical performance data. The positive predictive value (PPV) of two APOCT used in the asymptomatic screening of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers (HCW) at continuing care (CC) sites across Alberta, Canada was evaluated. Between February 22 and May 2, 2021, CC sites implemented SARS-CoV-2 voluntary screening of their asymptomatic HCW. Onsite testing with Abbott Panbio or BD Veritor occurred on a weekly or twice weekly basis. Positive APOCT were confirmed with a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) reference method. A total of 71,847 APOCT (17,689 Veritor and 54,158 Panbio) were performed among 369 CC sites. Eighty-seven (0.12%) APOCT were positive, of which 39 (0.05%) confirmed as true positives using rRT-PCR. Use of the Veritor and Panbio resulted in a 76.6% and 30.0% false positive detection, respectively (p<0.001). This corresponded to a 23.4% and 70.0% PPV for the Veritor and Panbio, respectively. Frequent screening of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic HCW in CC, using APOCT, resulted in a very low detection rate and a high detection of false positives. Careful assessment between the risks vs benefits of APOCT programs and prevalence of infection in this population needs to be thoroughly considered before implementation.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34351679	Deceased donor liver transplantation from a SARS-CoV-2 positive donor to a SARS-CoV-2 positive recipient. Liver grafts from deceased donors with active SARS-CoV-2 infection carry an unknown risk of transmission. Recently, the OPTN Ad Hoc DTAC summary stated that the decision to recover organs from donors with active COVID-19 should consider the recipient's risk of mortality by delaying the transplantation while waiting for a suitable donor and the potential risk of donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 (1). With the high likelihood of persistent community transmission, many deceased donor livers from SARS-CoV-2 infected donors will not be transplanted (2).	Case Report
34226202	Safeguarding teenagers in a sexual health service during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The first aim was to examine how the COVID-19 restrictions on movement impacted on teenagers' access to a local sexual health service (SHS). The second aim was to audit whether safeguarding assessments were carried out for those accessing the service remotely. METHODS: April-September 2020 consultation numbers for teenagers aged 17 years and under were compared with the 2019 equivalent. Service safeguarding assessment standards were reviewed for teenagers receiving telephone consultations for the first 6 months of lockdown, April-September 2020. RESULTS: There was a reduction in contact with the service of 100% for those aged 13 years and younger, 52% for those aged 14 and 15 years and 31% for those aged 16 and 17 years for the compared months. A safeguarding assessment was either carried out by the service or accounted for by a partner community practitioner for all contacts with the service by young people 15 years or younger. 96% of safeguarding assessments were carried out for those aged 16-17 years. CONCLUSIONS: There was a reduction in consultations for all age groups examined in the 6 months following lockdown. This adds to the evidence that restrictions during lockdown are barriers to young people accessing SHSs. For those who did have a consultation, safeguarding assessments were consistently carried out. Nevertheless, due to reduced contact overall, it is likely that some safeguarding issues remain undisclosed. Multiagency safeguarding networks and telephone consultations with a low threshold for promoting an in-person consultation facilitated access to the SHS and a robust safeguarding pathway during the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic.

34366659	Neurological manifestations in mild and moderate cases of COVID-19. Background: The coronavirus disease due to SARS COVID-2 emerged from Wuhan city in China in December 2019 and rapidly spread to more than 200 countries all over the world as a global health pandemic. Its primary presentation is respiratory and cardiac. However, some neurological manifestations are also reported. We tried to explore the reported neurological manifestations in a group of non-hospitalized mild and moderate COVID-19 patients. We contacted 107 patients via phone calls and e-mail messages, within 10 days of clinical presentation. The collected data regarded the neurological and non-neurological symptoms of the disease using a questionnaire that collected medical information of each patient. Results: It is found that 100% of patients have been reported with at least one neurological symptom during the first 10 days of COVID-19 presentation. The most common were headache which recorded 72% of the total. Then anosmia-dysgeusia which reached 52%, then myalgia with 44%, fatigue with 33% and dizziness with 32%. While the less common was numbness, migraine, loss of concentration, and seizures. Conclusion: There are many neurological manifestations found to be very common in COVID-19 patients even in mild cases, which when added to the increasing reports of serious cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, myelitis, stroke, and encephalitis in COVID-19 patients support CNS invasion of the virus and assures the importance of neurological assessment of COVID-19 patients both in the acute phase of infection and after recovery for potential neurological sequelae.

34228774	Association Between Administration of IL-6 Antagonists and Mortality Among Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Meta-analysis. Importance: Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of IL-6 antagonists in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have variously reported benefit, no effect, and harm. Objective: To estimate the association between administration of IL-6 antagonists compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality and other outcomes. Data Sources: Trials were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases between October 2020 and January 2021. Searches were not restricted by trial status or language. Additional trials were identified through contact with experts. Study Selection: Eligible trials randomly assigned patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to a group in whom IL-6 antagonists were administered and to a group in whom neither IL-6 antagonists nor any other immunomodulators except corticosteroids were administered. Among 72 potentially eligible trials, 27 (37.5%) met study selection criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: In this prospective meta-analysis, risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs) for 28-day all-cause mortality. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. There were 9 secondary outcomes including progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death and risk of secondary infection by 28 days. Results: A total of 10930 patients (median age, 61 years [range of medians, 52-68 years]; 3560 [33%] were women) participating in 27 trials were included. By 28 days, there were 1407 deaths among 6449 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 1158 deaths among 4481 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.95]; P = .003 based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis). This corresponds to an absolute mortality risk of 22% for IL-6 antagonists compared with an assumed mortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo. The corresponding summary ORs were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P < .001) for tocilizumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.86-1.36; P = .52) for sarilumab. The summary ORs for the association with mortality compared with usual care or placebo in those receiving corticosteroids were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87) for tocilizumab and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.61-1.38) for sarilumab. The ORs for the association with progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death, compared with usual care or placebo, were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85) for all IL-6 antagonists, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.82) for tocilizumab, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.74-1.34) for sarilumab. Secondary infections by 28 days occurred in 21.9% of patients treated with IL-6 antagonists vs 17.6% of patients treated with usual care or placebo (OR accounting for trial sample sizes, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.16). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, administration of IL-6 antagonists, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.

34225657	Epidemiology of SARS-CoV2 in Qatar's primary care population aged 10 years and above. BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to elucidate the epidemiology of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and characterize its potential impact. Investing in characterising the SARS-CoV2 will help plan and improve the response to the pandemic. Furthermore, it will help identify the most efficient ways of managing the pandemic, avoiding public health policies and interventions that may be unduly restrictive of normal activity or unnecessarily costly. This paper describes the design and reports findings of a population based epidemiological study undertaken to characterise SARS-CoV2 in Qatar using limited resources in a timely manner. METHODS: Asymptomatic individuals >/=10 years registered with Qatar's publicly funded primary health provider were eligible. A stratified random sampling technique was utilized to identify the study sample. Participants were invited to an appointment where they completed a questionnaire and provided samples for polymerase chain reaction and Immunoglobulin M and G immunoassay tests. Data collected were analyzed to calculate point and period prevalence by sociodemographic, lifestyle and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of 18,918 individuals invited for the study, 2084 participated (response rate 10.8%). The overall point prevalence and period prevalence were estimated to be 1.6% (95% CI 1.1-2.2) and 14.6% (95% CI 13.1-16.2) respectively. Period prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection was not considerably different across age groups (9.7-19.8%). It was higher in males compared to females (16.2 and 12.7% respectively). A significant variation was observed by nationality (7.1 to 22.2%) and municipalities (6.9-35.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The study provides an example of a methodologically robust approach that can be undertaken in a timely manner with limited resources. It reports much-needed epidemiological data about the spread of SARS-CoV2. Given the low prevalence rates, majority of the population in Qatar remains susceptible. Enhanced surveillance must continue to be in place, particularly due to the large number of asymptomatic cases observed. Robust contact tracing and social distancing measures are key to prevent future outbreaks.	Prevention
34219500	Simultaneous Sudden Hearing Loss and Peripheral Facial Paralysis in a Patient With Covid-19. Although peripheral facial paralysis and sudden sensorineural hearing loss are not as common as anosmia, they are reported neurological manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We present a 62-year-old, serologically COVID-19 positive woman with seventh and eighth nerve involvement showed electrophysiologically with Auditory Brainstem Response and electroneurography and radiologically with internal acoustic canal magnetic resonance imaging. This single case report suggests a possible association between the SARS-CoV-2 infection with simultaneous sudden sensorineural hearing loss and isolated facial paralysis. However, further studies are needed to determine whether this relationship is coincidental or occasional.	Case Report
34206845	Is There a Temporal Relationship between COVID-19 Infections among Prison Staff, Incarcerated Persons and the Larger Community in the United States? BACKGROUND: Our objective was to examine the temporal relationship between COVID-19 infections among prison staff, incarcerated individuals, and the general population in the county where the prison is located among federal prisons in the United States. METHODS: We employed population-standardized regressions with fixed effects for prisons to predict the number of active cases of COVID-19 among incarcerated persons using data from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for the months of March to December in 2020 for 63 prisons. RESULTS: There is a significant relationship between the COVID-19 prevalence among staff, and through them, the larger community, and COVID-19 prevalence among incarcerated persons in the US federal prison system. When staff rates are low or at zero, COVID-19 incidence in the larger community continues to have an association with COVID-19 prevalence among incarcerated persons, suggesting possible pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission by staff. Masking policies slightly reduced COVID-19 prevalence among incarcerated persons, though the association between infections among staff, the community, and incarcerated persons remained significant and strong. CONCLUSION: The relationship between COVID-19 infections among staff and incarcerated persons shows that staff is vital to infection control, and correctional administrators should also focus infection containment efforts on staff, in addition to incarcerated persons.

34292815	The Use of Telehealth for Orthopedic Consultations and Assessments: A Systematic Review. As a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, tele-health for orthopedic care is expanding rapidly. The authors sought to identify the evidence describing the effectiveness, barriers, and clinical applications of telehealth for orthopedic assessments and consultations. MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to March 2020. Forty-seven studies were included, with the most common conditions evaluated being trauma related and the primary modality being videoconferencing. Available literature supports the use of telehealth for orthopedic consultations and assessments because it yields moderate-to-high patient and provider satisfaction, accurate examinations, cost-effectiveness, and reduced wait times. Most commonly reported concerns were professional liability, network security, and technical issues. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid implementation and uptake of virtual assessment for patient care has occurred. The current evidence suggests that telehealth is capable of providing prompt access to quality, cost-efficient orthopedic consultations and assessments. [Orthopedics. 2021;44(4):198--206.].

34376994	COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance: A Review. As the world continues to respond to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), there is a larger hidden threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) lurking behind. AMR remains worrisome in that the pathogens causing resistant infections to thrive in hospitals and medical facilities, putting all patients at risk, irrespective of the severity of their medical conditions, further compounding the management of COVID-19. This study aims to provide overview of early findings on COVID-19 and AMR as well as to provide recommendations and lesson learned toward improving antimicrobial stewardship. We conducted a rapid narrative review of published articles by searching PubMed and Google Scholar on COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance with predetermined keywords. Secondary bacterial infections play crucial roles in mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19. Research has shown that a minority of COVID-19 patients need antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections. Current evidence reiterates the need not to give antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis to patients with mild COVID-19 or to patients with suspected or confirmed moderate COVID-19 illness unless it is indicated. The pandemic has also brought to the fore the deficiencies in health systems around the world. This comes with a lot of lessons, one of which is that despite the advances in medicine; we remain incredibly vulnerable to infections with limited or no standard therapies. This is worth thinking in the context of AMR, as the resistant pathogens are evolving and leading us to the era of untreatable infections. There is a necessity for continuous research into understanding and controlling infectious agents, as well as the development of newer functional antimicrobials and the need to strengthen the antimicrobial stewardship programs.

34216119	Effects of Interferon Beta in COVID-19 adult patients: Systematic Review. BACKGROUND: The high rate of transmission and infection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of major epidemiological concern. No definitive treatments have been established, and vaccinations have only recently begun. We aim to review the efficacy and safety of Interferon Beta (IFN-beta) in patients who have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search from PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were conducted from December 2019 to December 2020 to review the efficacy and safety of IFN-beta in adult patients with COVID-19 confirmed. We included randomized controlled trials, case reports, and experimental studies. Correspondences, letters, editorials, reviews, commentaries, case control, cross-sectional, and cohort studies that did not include any new clinical data were excluded. RESULTS: Of the 66 searched studies, 8 were included in our review. These studies demonstrated that although IFN-beta did not reduce the time to clinical response, there was an increase in discharge rate at day 14 and a decrease in mortality at day 28. The time to negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was shown to be significantly shortened in patients receiving IFN-beta, along with a lower nasopharyngeal viral load. Further, patients receiving IFN-beta had a less significant rise in IL-6. IFN-beta was shown to decrease intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, the requirement of invasive ventilation in severe cases, and improve the survival rate compared to control groups. There were no severe adverse events reported. Our review found that patients who received early treatment with IFN-beta experienced significantly reduced length of hospitalization, mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation. A greater chance of clinical improvement and improved imaging studies was noted in patients who received IFN-beta. There were no reported deaths associated with the addition of IFN-beta. Further randomized trials involving more significant sample sizes are needed to better understand the effect of IFN-beta on survival in COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This review identified encouraging data and outcomes of incorporating IFN-beta to treat COVID-19 patients. IFN-beta has been shown to decrease hospital stay's overall length and decrease the severity of respiratory symptoms when added to the standard of care. Also, in some studies, it has been demonstrated to reduce the length of ICU stay, enhance survival rate, and decrease the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. There were minor side effects reported (neuropsychiatric symptoms and hypersensitivity reaction). However, randomized clinical trials with a large sample size are needed to assess IFN-beta's benefit precisely.	Treatment
34202835	Heparan Sulfate Binding Cationic Peptides Restrict SARS-CoV-2 Entry. A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic. While the world is striving for a treatment modality against SARS-CoV-2, our understanding about the virus entry mechanisms may help to design entry inhibitors, which may help to limit the virus spreading. Owing to the importance of cellular ACE2 and heparan sulfate in SARS-CoV-2 entry, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cationic G1 and G2 peptides in virus entry inhibition. In silico binding affinity studies revealed possible binding sites of G1 and G2 peptides on HS and ACE2, which are required for the spike-HS and spike-ACE2 interactions. Prophylactic treatment of G1 and G2 peptide was also proved to decrease the cell surface HS, an essential virus entry receptor. With these two mechanisms we confirm the possible use of cationic peptides to inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2.	Mechanism;Treatment
34203564	Electron Density Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Complexes. The work is devoted to the study of the complementarity of the electronic structures of the ligands and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The research methodology was based on determining of 3D maps of electron densities of complexes using an original quantum free-orbital AlteQ approach. We observed a positive relationship between the parameters of the electronic structure of the enzyme and ligands. A complementarity factor of the enzyme-ligand complexes has been proposed. The console applications of the AlteQ complementarity assessment for Windows and Linux (alteq_map_enzyme_ligand_4_win.exe and alteq_map_enzyme_ligand_4_linux) are available for free at the ChemoSophia webpage.

34221400	Differential alterations in peripheral lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 patients: upregulation of double-positive and double-negative T cells. Background: Viral infections cause alteration in the total number of lymphocytes and their subset distribution. We aimed to study peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 patients and to correlate these subsets with clinical and laboratory data, which may help in clarifying the pathogenesis to develop novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19. Methods: Twenty-six reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 patients were subjected to medical history-taking and a thorough clinical examination. Laboratory tests included complete blood count, D dimer, ferritin, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest CT was used to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia. Lymphocyte subsets were compared with those in 20 healthy controls using flow cytometry. Results: Leucopenia, relative neutrophilia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia together with marked elevation in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were observed in our COVID-19 patients. A marked reduction was observed in T cells, including both CD4 and CD8 cells, natural killer (NK), and natural killer T cells (NKT). Double-positive T (DPT) cells, double-negative T (DNT) cells, and B cells were elevated in the patients relative to the other lymphocyte subsets. Conclusion: Immune-inflammatory parameters are of utmost importance in understanding the pathogenesis and in the provisional diagnosis of COVID-19. Yet, adequate care must be taken during their interpretation because of the vast discrepancies observed between studies even in the same locality. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of B cells, DPT, and DNT cells in the pathogenesis and control of COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Treatment
34217409	Women's considerations and experiences for breast cancer screening and surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States: A focus group study. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in numerous changes in delivery of healthcare services, including breast cancer screening and surveillance. Although facilities have implemented a number of strategies to provide services, women's thoughts and experiences related to breast cancer screening and surveillance during a pandemic are not well known. This focus group study with women across seven states recruited through the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium aims to remedy this gap in information. Thirty women ranging in age from 31 to 69 participated in five virtual focus groups, eight of whom had prior breast cancer. The first three focus groups covered a range of topics related to screening and surveillance during the pandemic while the last two groups covered experiences and then a review of sample communications to women about screening and surveillance during the pandemic to obtain reactions and recommendations. More than half of the women had screening or surveillance during the pandemic. Coding and analyses resulted in nine themes in three topic areas: decision factors, screening experiences, and preferred communications. Themes included weighing the risks of COVID-19 versus cancer; feelings that screening and surveillance were mostly safe but barriers may be heightened; feeling safe when undergoing screening but receiving a range of pandemic-specific communications from none to a lot; and wanting communications that are personalized, clear and concise. Based on these findings, providers and facilities should assure women of pandemic safety measures, review methods and content of communications, and assess for barriers to screening that may be amplified during the pandemic, including anxiety and access.

34206895	Long-Term Longitudinal Evaluation of Six Commercial Immunoassays for the Detection of IgM and IgG Antibodies against SARS CoV-2. The number of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 has skyrocketed in the past year. Concerns have been raised regarding their performance characteristics, depending on the disease severity and the time of the analysis post-symptom onset (PSO). Thus, independent validations using an unbiased sample selection are required for meaningful serology data interpretation. We aimed to assess the clinical performance of six commercially available assays, the seroconversion, and the dynamics of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study included 528 serum samples from 156 patients with follow-up visits up to six months PSO and 161 serum samples from healthy people. The IgG/total antibodies positive percentage increased and remained above 95% after six months when chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) IgG antiS1/S2 and electro-chemiluminescent assay (ECLIA) total antiNP were used. At early time points PSO, chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) IgM antiS achieved the best sensitivity. IgM and IgG appear simultaneously in most circumstances, and when performed in parallel the sensitivity increases. The severe and the moderate clinical forms were significantly associated with higher seropositivity percentage and antibody levels. High specificity was found in all evaluated assays, but the sensitivity was variable depending on the time PSO, severity of disease, detection method and targeted antigen.	Diagnosis
34222742	COVID-19-related downscaling of in-hospital liver care decreased patient satisfaction and increased liver-related mortality. Background&Aims: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated down-scaling of in-hospital care to prohibit the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2). We (i)assessed patient perceptions on quality of care by tele-survey(cohort 1) and written questionnaire(cohort 2) and (ii)analyzed trends in elective and non-elective admissions prior to (12/2019-02/2020) and during (03/2020-05/2020) the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria. Methods: Two-hundred seventy-nine outpatients were recruited into cohort 1 and 138 patients into cohort 2. All admissions from 12/2019 to 05/2020 to the Division of Gastroenterology/Hepatology at the Vienna General Hospital were analyzed. Results: Thirty-two point six percent (n=91/279) of cohort 1 and 72.5%(n=95/131) of cohort 2 had tele-medical contact, while 59.5%(n=166/279)and 68.2%(n=90/132) had face-to-face visits. 24.1%(n=32/133) needed acute medical help during healthcare restrictions, however, 57.3%(n=51/89) reported that contacting their physician during COVID-19 was difficult or impossible. Patient-reported satisfaction with treatment decreased significantly during restrictions in cohort 1 (visual analog scale[VAS] 0-10:9.0+/-1.6 to8.6+/-2.2;p<0.001) and non-significantly in cohort 2 (VAS0-10:8.9+/-1.6 to8.7+/-2.1;p=0.182).Despite fewer hospital admissions during COVID-19, the proportion of non-elective admissions (+6.3%) and ICU-admissions (+6.7%) increased. Cirrhotic patients with non-elective admissions during COVID-19 had significantly higher MELD (25.5[14.2]vs.17.0[IQR:8.8]; p=0.003) and DeltaMELD(difference to last MELD;3.9+/-6.3vs.8.7+/-6.4;p=0.008), required immediate intensive care more frequently (26.7%vs.5.6%;p=0.034) and had significantly increased 30-day liver-related mortality (30.0%vs.8.3%;p=0.028). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic impacts on quality of liver care as evident from decreased patient satisfaction, hospitalization of sicker ACLD patients and increased liver-related mortality. Strategies for improved tele-medical liver care and preemptive treatment of cirrhosis-related complications are needed to counteract the COVID-19-associated restrictions of in-hospital care.

34346630	"[Patients who smoke: should we ignore the addiction or take care of the patient?] Smoking cessation yields large health gains, especially in times of COVID-19. Compared to measures to stop COVID-19, tobacco control is lagging behind. We studied smoking-cessation-care in the Netherlands, using qualitative interviews with physicians (N=55) and questionnaires among physicians and other healthcare providers (HCPs; N=883) in 2017. Who is responsible for what? Three actors emerged: the patient who smokes (end responsible for quitting), the HCP (quit-advice, counseling or referral) and the government (create a society that stimulates ""smoke-free""). Many HCPs do not ask about smoking, nor advise to quit. The task-division is unclear, as smoking causes multiple diseases that are part of multiple disciplines and specializations. HCPs that see smoking as a serious addiction are more inclined to ensure adequate smoking-cessation-care for their patients. Fortunately, there are positive developments as well, both within healthcare as society, and ways in which you can contribute."	Prevention
34358993	Identifying compounds that prevent the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein to ACE2. We investigated compounds selected by molecular docking to identify a specific treatment for COVID-19 that decreases the interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Five compounds that interact with ACE2 amino acids Gln24, Asp30, His34, Tyr41, Gln42, Met82, Lys353, and Arg357 were evaluated using specific binding assays for their effects on the interaction between ACE2 with RBD. The compound labeled ED demonstrated favorable ACE2-binding, with an IC50 of 31.95 muM. ED cytotoxicity, evaluated using PC3 cells in an MTT assay, was consistent with the low theoretical toxicity previously reported. We propose that ED mainly interacts with His34, Glu37, and Lys353 in ACE2 and that it has an inhibitory effect on the interaction of ACE2 with the RBD of the S-protein. We recommend further investigation to develop ED into a potential drug or adjuvant in COVID-19 treatment.	Mechanism;Treatment
34220559	Coping With Oral Tongue Cancer and COVID-19 Infection. To date, April 19, 2021, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused about 140,886,773 confirmed cases and more than 3,000,000 deaths worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic. Oncology patients are usually frail due to the fear of prognosis, recurrence, and outcomes of treatments. Thus, coping with cancer is a complicated process that is necessary to overcome oncological challenge, even more in case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease. This is a brief case report on a middle-aged man affected by advanced oral tongue cancer and COVID-19, describing his experience of cancer diagnosis, surgical treatment, and rehabilitation during the hospital quarantine for COVID-19. Besides the traumatic experience due to the functional alteration in breathing, eating, and speaking caused by major surgery and the concurrent facial disfigurement, our patient had to face a COVID-19 diagnosis, which implied hospital and social isolation. The aim of this perspective work is to focus on the role of the psychological support in the management of hospital distress related to COVID-19 psychophysical loneliness or alienation. In our experience, such support should anticipate patients' oncological surgery or treatment and should be implemented through telemedicine in case of isolation or after hospital discharge.

34228508	Outcomes and Prognostic Factors in a Large Cohort of Hospitalized Cancer Patients With COVID-19. PURPOSE: Patients with cancer are at increased risk for unfavorable outcomes from COVID-19. Knowledge about the outcome determinants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in this population is essential for risk stratification and definition of appropriate management. Our objective was to evaluate prognostic factors for all-cause mortality in patients diagnosed with both cancer and COVID-19. METHODS: All consecutive patients with cancer hospitalized at our institution with COVID-19 were included. Electronic medical records were reviewed for clinical and laboratory characteristics potentially associated with outcomes. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-six consecutive patients with cancer and COVID-19 were included in the present study. An overall in-hospital mortality rate of 49.3% was demonstrated. Clinical factors associated with increased risk of death because of COVID-19 were age over 65 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status > 0 zero, best supportive care, primary lung cancer, and the presence of lung metastases. Laboratory findings associated with a higher risk of unfavorable outcomes were neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and elevated levels of D-dimer, creatinine, C-reactive protein, or AST. CONCLUSION: A high mortality rate in patients with cancer who were diagnosed with COVID-19 was demonstrated in the present study, emphasizing the need for close surveillance in this group of patients, especially in those with unfavorable prognostic characteristics.

34133036	"Telehealth during COVID-19: The perspective of alcohol and other drug nurses. AIM: This study aimed to explore the experiences of alcohol and other drug nurses transitioning to telehealth due to the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused immense disruption to healthcare services, and to reduce viral transmission, many services moved to off-site care delivery modalities such as telehealth. DESIGN: We used a qualitative descriptive design for this study. METHODS: Secondary analysis of semistructured interviews with alcohol and other drug nurses from Australia and New Zealand (n = 19) was conducted in July and August 2020. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and reported using COREQ guidelines. RESULTS: Three were identified: '""All our face-to-face contact ceased with clients"": Changing service delivery', '""How do I do my job when I can't see you?"": An anxious shift in service delivery' and '""A lot of Indigenous people don't like the FaceTiming and all that"": Challenges to delivery of services through telehealth'. CONCLUSION: Participants in our study reported challenges in transitioning to telehealth modalities. The perceived loss of therapeutic communication, difficulties in assessing risks to healthcare consumers such as domestic violence and challenges delivering telehealth care to a marginalized consumer cohort need to be overcome before telehealth is considered successful in alcohol and other drug treatment. However, telehealth was a successful adjunct to existing practices for nurses working with consumers in regional or remote areas or where consumers preferred this method of service delivery. IMPACT: Nurses in this study described substantial issues with the delivery of alcohol and other drug treatment via telehealth, including a perception that telehealth was a barrier to addressing risks to consumers who use alcohol and other drugs, and difficulties working in a therapeutically beneficial way via telehealth. Telehealth is a means to reduce viral transmission through a reduction in face-to-face contact, and although it may be useful for some service functions, it may be detrimental to the clinical services nurses provide."

It spread around the world in just a few months and became a worldwide pandemic. Quick and accurate diagnosis of infected patients is very important for controlling transmission. In addition to the commonly used Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection techniques, other diagnostic techniques are also emerging endlessly. This article reviews the current diagnostic methods for COVID-19 and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. It provides an important reference for the diagnosis of COVID-19.	Diagnosis
34337110	Dentistry pathways of coronaviruses transmission: a review. The nCoV-19 in a short period of time, in lower than two months has been spread as a pandemic in all over the world. This novel type of Coronavirus which shows itself with coughing, sneezing, fatigue and respiratory symptoms which is similar to cold illness has killed more than 100,000 people. However, many protocols have been established to minimize the number of infected people, but without any border and regardless the nationality, this virus has been spread in all countries. In this review, with broad mechanistic and interdisciplinary consideration the dentistry pathways of transmission, physiology, effective and available drugs and their biological inhibiting pathways have been discussed. Among many reasons that have caused higher rate of spreading, the dental services and surgeries involve to professional-patient close contacts could be seen as one of the probable pathways of transmission for this virus. According to the more recently reported literatures, the blueprint of many individual and instrumental reasons in dentistry, could be observed in nCoV-19 infection and spreading which raise the concern of the professionals about the efficiency of conventional antiviral methods. So, results of many studies attributed to the facts that the superhydrophobic antiviral materials and surfaces are potential candidates for designing dentistry instruments with more antiviral properties.

34206970	Plant-Based Phytochemical Screening by Targeting Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2 to Design Effective Potent Inhibitors. Currently, a worldwide pandemic has been declared in response to the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a fatal and fast-spreading viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The low availability of efficient vaccines and treatment options has resulted in a high mortality rate, bringing the world economy to its knees. Thus, mechanistic investigations of drugs capable of counteracting this disease are in high demand. The main protease (M(pro)) expressed by SARS-CoV-2 has been targeted for the development of potential drug candidates due to the crucial role played by M(pro) in viral replication and transcription. We generated a phytochemical library containing 1672 phytochemicals derived from 56 plants, which have been reported as having antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activity. A molecular docking program was used to screen the top three candidate compounds: epicatechin-3-O-gallate, psi-taraxasterol, and catechin gallate, which had respective binding affinities of -8.4, -8.5, and -8.8 kcal/mol. Several active sites in the targeted protein, including Cys145, His41, Met49, Glu66, and Met165, were found to interact with the top three candidate compounds. The multiple simulation profile, root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation, radius of gyration, and solvent-accessible surface area values supported the inflexible nature of the docked protein-compound complexes. The toxicity and carcinogenicity profiles were assessed, which showed that epicatechin-3-O-gallate, psi-taraxasterol, and catechin gallate had favorable pharmacological properties with no adverse effects. These findings suggest that these compounds could be developed as part of an effective drug development pathway to treat COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34198547	Computational Intelligence-Based Model for Mortality Rate Prediction in COVID-19 Patients. The COVID-19 outbreak is currently one of the biggest challenges facing countries around the world. Millions of people have lost their lives due to COVID-19. Therefore, the accurate early detection and identification of severe COVID-19 cases can reduce the mortality rate and the likelihood of further complications. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been shown to be effective in the detection and diagnosis of several diseases, including COVID-19. This study used ML algorithms, such as Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and DL model (containing six layers with ReLU and output layer with sigmoid activation), to predict the mortality rate in COVID-19 cases. Models were trained using confirmed COVID-19 patients from 146 countries. Comparative analysis was performed among ML and DL models using a reduced feature set. The best results were achieved using the proposed DL model, with an accuracy of 0.97. Experimental results reveal the significance of the proposed model over the baseline study in the literature with the reduced feature set.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34344406	Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with lower respiratory tract infections in China. BACKGROUND: The multifaceted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) taken during the COVID-19 pandemic not only decrease the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2, but have impact on the prevalence of other viruses. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of common respiratory viruses among hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Respiratory specimens were obtained from children with LRTI at Children's Hospital of Fudan University for detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1 to 3, influenza virus A (FluA), influenza virus B (FluB), human metapneumovirus (MPV) and rhinovirus (RV). The data were analyzed and compared between the year of 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic) and 2019 (before COVID-19 pandemic). RESULTS: A total of 7107 patients were enrolled, including 4600 patients in 2019 and 2507 patients in 2020. Compared with 2019, we observed an unprecedented reduction of RSV, ADV, FluA, FluB, and MPV infections in 2020, despite of reopening of schools in June, 2020. However, the RV infection was significantly increased in 2020 and a sharp increase was observed especially after reopening of schools. Besides, the PIV infection showed resurgent characteristic after September of 2020. The mixed infections were significantly less frequent in 2020 compared with the year of 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The NPIs during the COVID-19 pandemic have great impact on the prevalence of common respiratory viruses in China. Meanwhile, we do need to be cautious of a possible resurgence of some respiratory viruses as the COVID-19 restrictions are relaxed.	Prevention
34355678	Anti-Coronavirus Vaccines: Past Investigations on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, the Approved Vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, Oxford/AstraZeneca and others under Development Against SARS-CoV-2 Infection. The aim of this review article is to summarize the knowledge available to date on prophylaxis achievements to fight against Coronavirus. This work will give an overview of what is reported in the most recent literature on vaccines (under investigation or already developed like BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and ChAdOx1-S) effective against the most pathogenic Coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2), with of course particular attention paid to those under development or already in use to combat the current COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 19) pandemic. Our main objective is to make a contribution to the comprehension, additionally at a molecular level, of what is currently ready for anti-SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic intervention, as well as to provide the reader with an overall picture of the most innovative approaches for the development of vaccines that could be of general utility in the fight against the most pathogenic Coronaviruses.

34345878	Air-liquid interface cultures of the healthy and diseased human respiratory tract: promises, challenges and future directions. Air-liquid interface (ALI) culture models currently represent a valid instrument to recreate the typical aspects of the respiratory tract in vitro in both healthy and diseased state. They can help reducing the number of animal experiments, therefore, supporting the 3R principle. This review discusses ALI cultures and co-cultures derived from immortalized as well as primary cells, which are used to study the most common disorders of the respiratory tract, in terms of both pathophysiology and drug screening. The article displays ALI models used to simulate inflammatory lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, and viral infections. It also includes a focus on ALI cultures described in literature studying respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 causing the global Covid-19 pandemic at the time of writing this review. Additionally, commercially available models of ALI cultures are presented. Ultimately, the aim of this review is to provide a detailed overview of ALI models currently available and to critically discuss them in the context of the most prevalent diseases of the respiratory tract.

34216501	Establishing quality evaluation system of nursing management in fever clinics: A Delphi method. AIM: The aim of this study is to construct a quality evaluation system for fever clinic nursing management. BACKGROUND: Fever clinic is the first line of defence against the epidemic during COVID-19 in China. METHODS: Our study combines the Delphi method and the analytic hierarchy process. Delphi method was used to carry out two rounds of consultation for 18 experts, to select and revise indicators at all levels. Analytic hierarchy process was used to calculate the weight of indicators at all levels. RESULTS: A quality evaluation system of nursing management for fever clinics is built using Delphi method. It includes five first-level indexes, 14 second-level indexes and 82 third-level indexes. A two-round expert consultation is used to build the indicators. The recovery rates of expert questionnaires in the two rounds were, respectively, 100% and 94%, and expert authority coefficients were 0.925. The Kendall coefficients in the two rounds were, respectively, 0.205 and 0.162 (P < .001). The weight analysis shows that health management of nursing staff (0.2803) and disinfection isolation and treatment of medical waste (0.2803) are most important, followed by nursing post management and personnel training (0.1889), configuration and management of equipment (0.1427) and patient consultation management and nursing (0.1078). CONCLUSION: The quality evaluation system of nursing management in the constructed fever clinic is used to put forward a specific, objective and quantifiable evaluation criteria of nursing quality for fever clinic management, which can better meet the needs of epidemic prevention and control, and has a certain application and promotion value. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The establishment and improvement of a quality system for fever clinic care management will help to respond to outbreaks such as COVID-19.	Prevention
34290884	An observational study of a cohort of citizens receiving the AZD1222 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. In this retrospective study, a cohort of 67 subjects vaccinated with AZD1222 was retrospectively observed. Consistently with published findings, no serious adverse event was reported, and all adverse events reported (fever, muscle ache and/or pain in the site of injection) had resolved by day 8. Of note, some citizens were prescribed low-dose aspirin and even heparin for thrombosis prevention. We also found variations in laboratory test results (full blood count and chemistry) on day 1 compared with day 8. Physicians should be aware that no prevention therapy for thrombosis is currently recommended, given the very low incidence of this side effect. Additional studies are warranted to interpret our findings.	Treatment
34370408	A variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: AMSAN. Introduction - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection that has rapidly become a global pandemic and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed with great success. In this article, we would like to present a patient who developed Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), which is a serious complication after receiving the inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac). Case report - A 76-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with nine days of progressive limb weakness. Two weeks prior to admission, he received the second dose of CoronaVac vaccine. Motor examination revealed decreased extremity strength with 3/5 in the lower extremities versus 4/5 in the upper extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in all four extremities. Nerve conduction studies showed predominantly reduced amplitude in both motor and sensory nerves, consistent with AMSAN (acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy). Conclusion - Clinicians should be aware of the neuro-logical complications or other side effects associated with COVID-19 vaccination so that early treatment can be an option.	Case Report
34220357	COVID-19 in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients: a Review of the Current Literature. Purpose of review: The approach to ongoing organ transplantation and management of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) has evolved tremendously since the pandemic's beginning. We summarize the current literature surrounding the virology of SARS-CoV-2, epidemiology of COVID-19 in transplant recipients, review the clinical features and complications of COVID-19 in SOTR, and discuss the safety and efficacy of current therapies and candidate vaccines in this population. Recent findings: Despite initial suspensions in organ transplantation during early 2020, routine donor testing and de-crowding of hospitals have allowed transplant activity to resume at pre-pandemic rates. COVID-19-associated mortality in SOTR is similar to that of the general population, and lower than that of patients with end-organ disease awaiting transplant. The optimal approach to immunosuppression in SOTR with COVID-19 is unknown and disease severity may influence management decisions. Many vaccines in development are likely to be safe for immunocompromised hosts, though post-marketing investigations will be required to determine the efficacy in the SOTR. Summary: Though there are multiple unique considerations in the care of SOTR with COVID-19, immunosuppression does not appear to have a detrimental impact on overall outcome. Organ transplantation remains a lifesaving intervention and can be safely performed despite a global pandemic.	Treatment
34371208	Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and COVID-19: A systematic synthesis of worldwide cases. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) has been reported after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we systematically included worldwide reported cases on this association. We included 30 case reports (pediatric and adults) and explored epidemiological and clinical evidence. We described time to diagnosis, clinical, imaging, and laboratory features, response to treatment regimens, and differences regarding severity. Also, an original case report was presented. Neurologists must be alert to the occurrence of multifocal neurological symptoms with or without encephalopathy in patients recovered from COVID-19. Timely MRI studies should be performed to establish the diagnosis and to consider early corticosteroid-based treatment.	Case Report
34198820	Epitope-Specific Response of Human Milk Immunoglobulins in COVID-19 Recovered Women. The breastfeeding of infants by mothers who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 has become a dramatic healthcare problem. The WHO recommends that infected women should not abandon breastfeeding; however, there is still the risk of contact transmission. Convalescent donor milk may provide a defense against the aforementioned issue and can eliminate the consequences of artificial feeding. Therefore, it is vital to characterize the epitope-specific immunological landscape of human milk from women who recovered from COVID-19. We carried out a comprehensive ELISA-based analysis of blood serum and human milk from maternity patients who had recovered from COVID-19 at different trimesters of pregnancy. It was found that patients predominantly contained SARS-CoV-2 N-protein-specific immunoglobulins and had manifested the antibodies for all the antigens tested in a protein-specific and time-dependent manner. Women who recovered from COVID-19 at trimester I-II showed a noticeable decrease in the number of milk samples with sIgA specific to the N-protein, linear NTD, and RBD-SD1 epitopes, and showed an increase in samples with RBD conformation-dependent sIgA. S-antigens were found to solely induce a sIgA1 response, whereas N-protein sIgA1 and sIgA2 subclasses were involved in 100% and 33% of cases. Overall, the antibody immunological landscape of convalescent donor milk suggests that it may be a potential defense agent against COVID-19 for infants, conferring them with a passive immunity.

34202584	Intracellular Routing and Recognition of Lipid-Based mRNA Nanoparticles. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is being extensively used in gene therapy and vaccination due to its safety over DNA, in the following ways: its lack of integration risk, cytoplasmic expression, and transient expression compatible with fine regulations. However, clinical applications of mRNA are limited by its fast degradation by nucleases, and the activation of detrimental immune responses. Advances in mRNA applications, with the recent approval of COVID-19 vaccines, were fueled by optimization of the mRNA sequence and the development of mRNA delivery systems. Although delivery systems and mRNA sequence optimization have been abundantly reviewed, understanding of the intracellular processing of mRNA is mandatory to improve its applications. We will focus on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as they are the most advanced nanocarriers for the delivery of mRNA. Here, we will review how mRNA therapeutic potency can be affected by its interactions with cellular proteins and intracellular distribution.	Mechanism;Treatment
34292178	Anaphylaxis and digital medicine. PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Digital medicine (mHealth) aims to help patients and healthcare providers (HCPs) improve and facilitate the provision of patient care. It encompasses equipment/connected medical devices, mHealth services and mHealth apps (apps). An updated review on digital health in anaphylaxis is proposed. RECENT FINDINGS: In anaphylaxis, mHealth is used in electronic health records and registries.It will greatly benefit from the new International Classification of Diseases-11 rules and artificial intelligence. Telehealth was revolutionised by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and lessons learnt should be extended to shared decision making in anaphylaxis. Very few nonvalidated apps exist and there is an urgent need to develop and validate such tools. SUMMARY: Although digital health appears to be of great importance in anaphylaxis, it is still insufficiently used.	Prevention
34290823	Reappraisal of trifluperidol against Nsp3 as a potential therapeutic for novel COVID-19: a molecular docking and dynamics study. Novel COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease that is caused by the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2. It is a fast-spreading disease that urgently requires therapeutics. The current study employed computational regression methods to target the ADP-ribose phosphatase (ADRP) domain of Nsp3 using FDA-approved drugs. Identified leads were further investigated using molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). The screening and MDS results suggest that trifluperidol could be a novel inhibitor of the ADRP domain of Nsp3. Trifluperidol could, therefore, be used to help control the spread of COVID-19, either alone or in combination with antiviral agents.	Mechanism;Treatment
34212751	Lessons from COVID-19 in South Africa: Keeping our environment clean should be the first law of health. In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the links between poor hygiene, unclean environments and human health cannot be overemphasised, particularly in South Africa with its high incidence of infectious diseases and overburdened health system. One very controllable factor that is often overlooked is the poor disposal of litter and waste management and its adverse effects on public health. By wearing masks, regular handwashing and sanitising, as well as making sure that neighbourhoods and public spaces are clean and safe, the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases can be prevented.

34349986	COVID-19: a review of current knowledge regarding exposure, quarantine, isolation and other preventive measures. Deeper understanding of the spread, morbidity, fatality, and development of immune response associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is necessary in order to establish an appropriate epidemiological and clinical response. Exposure control represents a key part of the combat against COVID-19, as the effectiveness of current therapeutic options remains partial. Since the preventive measures have not been sufficiently able to slow down this pandemic, in this article we explore some of the pertinent knowledge gaps, while overall looking to effective vaccination strategies as a way out. Early on, such strategies may need to rely on counting the convalescents as protected in order to speed up the immunization of the whole population.	Prevention
34284028	Computational analysis of TMPRSS2 expression in normal and SARS-CoV-2-infected human tissues. The transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is a key molecule for SARS-CoV-2 invading human host cells. To provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection of various human tissues and understand the potential mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we investigated TMPRSS2 expression in various normal human tissues and SARS-CoV-2-infected human tissues. Using publicly available datasets, we performed computational analyses of TMPRSS2 expression levels in 30 normal human tissues, and compared them between males and females and between younger (ages </= 49 years) and older (ages > 49 years) populations in these tissues. We found that TMPRSS2 expression levels were the highest in the prostate, stomach, pancreas, lungs, small intestine, and salivary gland. The TMPRSS2 protein had relatively high expression levels in the parathyroid gland, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, kidneys, seminal vesicle, epididymis, and prostate. However, TMPRSS2 expression levels were not significantly different between females and males or between younger and older populations in these tissues. The pathways enriched in TMPRSS2-upregulated pan-tissue were mainly involved in immune, metabolism, cell growth and proliferation, stromal signatures, and cancer and other diseases. Many cytokine genes displayed positive expression correlations with TMPRSS2 in pan-tissue, including TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, IFN-alpha, MCP-1, G-CSF, and IP-10. We further analyzed TMPRSS2 expression levels in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. TMPRSS2 expression levels showed no significant difference between males and females or between younger and older patients. However, they were significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2-infected than in healthy individuals and patients with other viral acute respiratory illnesses. Interestingly, TMPRSS2 expression levels were positively correlated with the enrichment levels of four immune signatures (B cells, CD8(+) T cells, NK cells, and interferon response) in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients but likely to be negatively correlated with them in the normal lung tissue. Our data may provide insights into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Mechanism;Treatment
34200112	"SARS-CoV-2 and Skin: The Pathologist's Point of View. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has dramatically changed our lives and habits. In just a few months, the most advanced and efficient health systems in the world have been overwhelmed by an infectious disease that has caused 3.26 million deaths and more than 156 million cases worldwide. Although the lung is the most frequently affected organ, the skin has also resulted in being a target body district, so much so as to suggest it may be a real ""sentinel"" of COVID-19 disease. Here we present 17 cases of skin manifestations studied and analyzed in recent months in our Department; immunohistochemical investigations were carried out on samples for the S1 spike-protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as electron microscopy investigations showing evidence of virions within the constituent cells of the eccrine sweat glands and the endothelium of small blood vessels. Finally, we conduct a brief review of the COVID-related skin manifestations, confirmed by immunohistochemistry and/or electron microscopy, described in the literature."	Diagnosis
34202350	Cardiac Events Potentially Associated to Remdesivir: An Analysis from the European Spontaneous Adverse Event Reporting System. Remdesivir was recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. As already reported in the Summary of Product Characteristics, most of remdesivir's safety concerns are hepatoxicity and nephrotoxicity related. However, some cases have raised concerns regarding the potential cardiac events associated with remdesivir; therefore, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of the European Medicines Agency requested to investigate all available data. Therefore, we analyzed all Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) collected in the EudraVigilance database focusing on cardiac adverse events. From April to December 2020, 1375 ICSRs related to remdesivir were retrieved from EudraVigilance, of which 863 (62.8%) were related to male and (43.3%) adult patients. A total of 82.2% of all AEs (N = 2604) was serious and one third of the total ICSRs (N = 416, 30.3%) had a fatal outcome. The most frequently reported events referred to hepatic/hepatobiliary disorders (19.4%,), renal and urinary disorders (11.1%) and cardiac events (8.4%). Among 221 cardiac ICSRs, 69 reported fatal outcomes. Other drugs for cardiovascular disorders were reported as suspected/concomitant together with remdesivir in 166 ICSRs (75.1%), 62 of which were fatal. Moreover, the mean time to overall cardiac event was 3.3 days (+/-2.2). Finally, disproportionality analysis showed a two-fold increased risk of reporting a cardiac adverse event associated with remdesivir compared to both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. This study showed that remdesivir could be associated to risk of cardiac events, suggesting a potential safety signal which has not been completely evaluated yet. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.	Treatment

Colchicine's medical evolution is historically bound to the Mediterranean basin, since remarkable researchers from this region underscored its valuable properties. With the passing of years colchicine became an essential pharmaceutical substance for the treatment of rheumatologic and cardiovascular diseases. In light of recent findings, the therapeutic value of colchicine has grown. In clinical practice, colchicine remains underutilized in view of its proven efficacy and safety. Its complex pharmacokinetics and multifaceted anti-inflammatory role remain under investigation. The current review addresses the safe administration of colchicine in view of key drug to drug interactions. Finally, we are briefly presenting colchicine's future potential applications.	Treatment
34226835	A prospective study on COVID-19 convalescent plasma donor (CCP) recruitment strategies in a resource constrained blood centre. Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across 87 million people with more than 1.8 million deaths in the world. As there is no definite treatment modality, the use of convalescent plasma has become increasingly popular worldwide. This study aimed to identify an appropriate strategy of donor recruitment and to evaluate the appropriateness of pre-set plasma donation guidelines. Material and Methods: In this prospective study conducted from May to September 2020, the donors were recruited under the following two circumstances: Group I, patients in the post-COVID-19 follow-up in the clinic, and Group II, patients recovered from COVID-19 recruited through mass and electronic media. A pre-set donor selection criteria and laboratory investigation was designed according to national and international guidelines. Approximately 500 ml of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) was collected from recovered individuals in each group by two different cell separators. The overall donor's attendance rate, deferral rate, adverse events and donor compliance was analysed and compared between the two groups. Results: There was a significant difference in attendance in relation to registration between the groups (P < 0.0001). Donor deferral was significantly higher in group II compared with group I. The single most frequent cause of donor deferral was low antibody index (P = 0.0001). The total donor adverse event rate in CCP donation was significantly lower compared with routine plateletpheresis procedures. The donor's compliance to blood centre's protocol was satisfactory in both the groups. Conclusion: Recruitment of patients in the post-COVID-19 follow-up in the clinic was more effective than the general recruitment through mass and electronic media for convalescence plasma donation in a resource-constrained blood centre.

34288697	Medical Oncology Patient Perceptions of Telehealth Video Visits. PURPOSE: Telehealth in medical oncology has expanded secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, quantitative research on medical oncology telehealth use shows conflicting results on patient satisfaction, whereas qualitative data are sparse. Our qualitative study aimed to identify the factors influencing patient acceptability of video visits for medical oncology care before and at the onset of the expansion of telehealth because of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted between November 2019 and April 2020 with 20 patients who participated in a telehealth visit with a medical oncology provider at Thomas Jefferson University. RESULTS: Of the 20 participants, 13 (65%) were female and 15 (75%) were White, with a mean (standard deviation) age of 60.5 years (11.8). Patients identified convenience, anxiety, COVID-19, and provider preference as positively influencing the acceptability of video visits; however, some patients noted limitations in provider connection, physical examinations, and visit length as disadvantages. Regarding receipt of serious or bad news, some preferred video visits for privacy, immediacy of results, news processing, and family comfort. Others preferred in-person encounters for provider support and the ability to receive written information and in-person referrals. CONCLUSION: Patient-perceived factors influencing general acceptability, appropriateness of serious and bad news delivery, and future uses of telehealth were unique to each individual, but shared common themes. Understanding each patient's perspective of telehealth acceptability and tailoring use to their preferences is critical for continued utilization. Further research is needed to understand and address reasons for lack of telehealth uptake among certain patients.	Prevention

This is the first case where the evidence of cytokine storm in neonate has been demonstrated in the presence of transplacental acquired IgG antibodies.	Case Report
34377355	COVID-19 in dental care: What do we know? SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is primarily transmitted by airborne droplets and its spread is favored by close human contact, thus the COVID-19 pandemic is the new challenge in dental practice. The oral cavity was considered as a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, the viruses were detected in the saliva and periodontal pockets of infected persons. Therefore, aside from the most common symptoms, COVID-19 can manifest as lesions in the oral cavity. Due to the high risk of cross-contamination in the dental office, new precautionary measures were implemented in professional dental care to ensure safety for both, dental staff and patients. Given the dynamically changing situation, dental practitioners should follow local guidelines and implement them according to current needs and available resources. The key to success is to reduce the risk of cross-infection with SARS-CoV-2 at no cost to the good oral health of the population.	Prevention
34218297	Percutaneous Achilles tenotomy under local anaesthetic in the clubfoot clinic was safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, for both children and parents. PURPOSE: An Achilles tenotomy is routinely required to correct the equinus deformity in Congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) patients as part of the gold standard treatment using the Ponseti method. This procedure can be performed in clinic under local anaesthetic or in theatre under general anaesthetic. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced theatre capacity and caused a delay to CTEV patients' treatment. A new standard operating procedure that allowed the tenotomies to be performed under local anaesthetic in the clinic was introduced. This study was looking into the safety, feasibility and parents' perspective of this procedure. METHODS: The study was prospectively registered as a service improvement project and followed the SQUIRE guidelines (Ogrinc et al. in BMJ Qual Saf 25:986-992, 2016). All consecutive patients requiring a tenotomy were included. Data was collected prospectively including demographics, Pirani score and a carers' satisfaction questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty five patients (36 tenotomies) were included in the study. The median age was 9 weeks. All patients achieved ankle dorsiflexion of greater than 15 degrees post-op. None of the patients nor their parents contracted the COVID 19 virus. All parents reported a positive experience and 99% felt less anxious about having the tenotomy done in clinic rather than theatre. CONCLUSIONS: The new service offering clinic tenotomies was found to be safe and clinically successful. This study is the first to show parents preference and excellent satisfaction with a tenotomy performed under local anaesthetic. The service has improved the allocation of resources and due to its success, will continue beyond the pandemic.	Prevention
34212182	The Patient's Perspective: Burn Reconstructive Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic. During the Covid-19 pandemic, hospital systems delayed or halted elective surgeries and outpatient care, profoundly disrupting reconstructive burn treatment ranging from surgery to postoperative therapy. This study aims to characterize burn patients' perspectives on reconstructive surgery during Covid-19. A 12-component questionnaire to burn patients awaiting reconstructive surgery at a single ABA verified Burn Center was administered. Responses regarding willingness to undergo reconstruction, perceived medical and personal impacts of Covid-19, and perspectives on telehealth were gathered. Surveys were administered to patients/caregivers over the phone in English and Spanish. Inclusion criteria consisted of burn patients who had elective reconstructive surgeries delayed or canceled as a result of the pandemic. 51 patients met our inclusion criteria. Of those, 23 patients responded to our survey (45%). Average patient age was 23, 43% were male, and a majority (52%) were pediatric. 22 (96%) patients were willing to undergo reconstruction during the Covid-19 pandemic, despite a perceived increased risk. 43% disagreed or strongly disagreed that telehealth adequately enabled communication with their burn care provider. 78% agreed or strongly agreed that they felt more susceptible to Covid-19 as burn patients. 83% agreed or strongly agreed that the Covid-19 pandemic had created stressors specifically related to their burn care. The majority of patients expressed a strong desire to return to surgical and therapeutic care delayed by Covid-19. Patients reported feeling especially vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic as burn patients, and cited difficulty obtaining care and financial stressors as the main causes.	Prevention
34227770	"Role of Mycobacterium w for the Treatment of COVID-19: An Observational Study. Background: COVID-19 has taken a big toll on the world in terms of morbidity and mortality. The disease may progress in some of the patients leading to trigger of ""cytokine storm"" which is shown to be associated with adverse outcomes. Heat killed Mycobacterium w (Mw) is a known immunomodulator which is approved for the treatment of gram negative sepsis. This study was carried out to evaluate the role of Mw in the treatment of COVID-19 early in the course of the disease. Method: In this retrospective observational study, 117 (84 males, 33 females) COVID-19 patients admitted between July 3, 2020 and Aug 26, 2020 in the covid ward of Fortis Hiranandani hospital, Mumbai, were enrolled. Patients were tested COVID-19 positive on RTPCR and were treated with standard of care treatment along with Mw 0.3 ml intradermal injection per day for 3 consecutive days. Patients were evaluated for live discharge as well as changes in the levels of inflammatory markers. Results: Use of Mw was seen to be associated with rapid recovery in 116/117 patients from COVID-19 who were discharged from the hospital within 10 days. A decrease in the levels of CRP and IL6 was observed after the administration of Mw. This decrease was associated with improvement in the patients' condition. The use of Mw was seen to be associated with no systemic side effects. Conclusion: The patients of COVID-19 may deteriorate due to exaggerated production of cytokines which may result in adverse outcomes. Mw used earlier in the disease not only effectively prevents excessive cytokine production but also contribute to rapid recovery. Mw was also found to be safe in use. Larger randomized controlled trials are recommended to assess the role of Mw in COVID-19."	Treatment
34217692	Lung Cancer Surgery in the early phase after acute COVID-19 pneumonitis. A 65-year-old female was diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer in 2020 and scheduled for robotic assisted left upper lobectomy. Unfortunately, the patient contracted symptomatic COVID-19, resulting in postponement of lung resection. 6 weeks following acute infection she was admitted for surgery. A pre-operative computed tomography scan showed widespread interstitial pneumonitis. However, the surgery went ahead given concerns over tumour progression, albeit with a lesser resection to preserve lung tissue as the patient was slightly hypoxic. Her postoperative recovery was uneventful and she was discharged 5 days later. Final histology confirmed a fully resected stage T1cN0M0 adenocarcinoma of the lung.	Case Report
34284534	Pandemic Hospitals and Re-organizing Emergency Departments. Emergency departments have always been the first point of contact for hospitals in many situations, including man-made and natural disasters. The first places where patients with symptoms of COVID-19 were met in health institutions were also emergency departments. Emergency departments play an important role in diagnosing the disease and isolating patients (by hospitalization if necessary). The process, which starts with the triage of outpatients admitted to the emergency department and brought by ambulance, continues as isolation of the patients in appropriate areas including physical evaluation, management of laboratory and scanning processes and, if necessary, providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation with airway support. Afterwards, patients can be treated as an outpatient, or hospitalized, or treated at the intensive care unit in line with their preliminary diagnosis and clinical conditions. Disruptions that may occur in one or more of these stages can lead to crowds and lengthy queues in the emergency department by prolonging the follow-up period of the patients. One of the strengths of Turkey at this point is that emergency departments are accustomed to the heavy patient load. The experiences gained from these conditions have facilitated the organization of pre-hospital emergency medical services, pandemic hospitals, and their emergency departments. In this organization, the main goal should be to provide uninterrupted and high-quality patient care through personnel training, personal protection measures, and the creation of physical conditions. Turkey's emergency departments are accustomed to managing the intensive patient flow, as they work at full capacity during normal times. Thanks to the experiences of emergency healthcare workers, health service was provided without any patient being turned away from the door of the emergency departments during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we aimed to present the organization of pandemic hospitals and emergency departments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We made a schematic representation of the architectural areas through the emergency department of Ankara City Hospital, which has a bed capacity of 3810 with 256 beds in emergency department.

In assessing species susceptibility for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and in the search for an appropriate animal model, multiple research groups around the world inoculated a broad range of animal species using various SARS-CoV-2 strains, doses and administration routes. Although in silico analyses based on receptor binding and diverse in vitro cell cultures were valuable, exact prediction of species susceptibility based on these tools proved challenging. Here, we assessed whether precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) could facilitate the selection of animal models, thereby reducing animal experimentation. Pig, hamster and cat PCLS were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 and virus replication was followed over time. Virus replicated efficiently in PCLS from hamsters and cats, while no evidence of replication was obtained for pig PCLS. These data corroborate the findings of many research groups that have investigated the susceptibility of hamsters, pigs and cats towards infection with SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest that PCLS can be used as convenient tool for the screening of different animal species for sensitivity to newly emerged viruses. To validate our results obtained in PCLS, we employed the hamster model. Hamsters were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 via the intranasal route. Susceptibility to infection was evaluated by body weight loss, viral loads in oropharyngeal swabs and respiratory tissues and lung pathology. The broadly used hamster model was further refined by including activity tracking of the hamsters by an activity wheel as a very robust and sensitive parameter for clinical health. In addition, to facilitate the quantification of pathology in the lungs, we devised a semi-quantitative scoring system for evaluating the degree of histological changes in the lungs. The inclusion of these additional parameters refined and enriched the hamster model, allowing for the generation of more data from a single experiment.	Diagnosis
34207391	Electron Donor-Acceptor Capacity of Selected Pharmaceuticals against COVID-19. More than a year ago, the first case of infection by a new coronavirus was identified, which subsequently produced a pandemic causing human deaths throughout the world. Much research has been published on this virus, and discoveries indicate that oxidative stress contributes to the possibility of getting sick from the new SARS-CoV-2. It follows that free radical scavengers may be useful for the treatment of coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19). This report investigates the antioxidant properties of nine antivirals, two anticancer molecules, one antibiotic, one antioxidant found in orange juice (Hesperidin), one anthelmintic and one antiparasitic (Ivermectin). A molecule that is apt for scavenging free radicals can be either an electron donor or electron acceptor. The results I present here show Valrubicin as the best electron acceptor (an anticancer drug with three F atoms in its structure) and elbasvir as the best electron donor (antiviral for chronic hepatitis C). Most antiviral drugs are good electron donors, meaning that they are molecules capable of reduzing other molecules. Ivermectin and Molnupiravir are two powerful COVID-19 drugs that are not good electron acceptors, and the fact that they are not as effective oxidants as other molecules may be an advantage. Electron acceptor molecules oxidize other molecules and affect the conditions necessary for viral infection, such as the replication and spread of the virus, but they may also oxidize molecules that are essential for life. This means that the weapons used to defend us from COVID-19 may also harm us. This study posits the idea that oxide reduction balance may help explain the toxicity or efficacy of these drugs. These results represent a further advance on the road towards understanding the action mechanisms of drugs used as possible treatments for COVID-19. Looking ahead, clinical studies are needed to define the importance of antioxidants in treating COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34293489	Population seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Anambra State, South-East, Nigeria. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of the Anambra State population that had been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and developed antibodies before the second wave. METHODS: The WHO-recommended health facility-based cross-sectional approach was adapted for this survey. Between 8(th) and 15(th) December 2020, 3142 participants across the 21 local government areas (LGAs) of the State, aged one year and over, attending randomly selected health facilities, were recruited. Demographic and symptom-related information were collected from the participants as well as whole peripheral blood, which was tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM with rapid test kits. RESULTS: 425 participants tested positive for IgG only, 74 for IgM only, while 54 were positive for both IgG and IgM. Overall, 553 positives were recorded, giving a crude seroprevalence of 17(.)6% (95% CI = 16(.)26 - 18(.)98). It ranged widely from 31(.)9% (95% CI = 24(.)43 - 40(.)22) in Onitsha North LGA to 5(.)4% (95% CI = 2(.)19 - 10(.)78) in Awka north. Bayesian Adjustments yielded a state seroprevalence of 16(.)1%. CONCLUSION: One in six state residents had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and developed antibodies before the second wave. All LGAs, age groups, sexes, and settlement types were affected by COVID-19. A large proportion of the population remained susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.	Diagnosis
34205837	COVID-19 and School: To Open or Not to Open, That Is the Question. The First Review on Current Knowledge. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented closure of schools in terms of duration. The option of school closure, SARS-CoV-2 initially being poorly known, was influenced by the epidemiological aspects of the influenza virus. However, school closure is still under debate and seems unsupported by sure evidence of efficacy in the COVID-19 era. The aim of our narrative review is to discuss the available literature on SARS-CoV-2 spread among children and adolescents, in the school setting, trying to explain why children appear less susceptible to severe disease and less involved in viral spreading. We also tried to define the efficacy of school closure, through an overview of the effects of the choices made by the various countries, trying to identify which preventive measures could be effective for a safe reopening. Finally, we focused on the psychological aspects of such a prolonged closure for children and adolescents. SARS-CoV-2, children, COVID-19, influenza, and school were used as key words in our literature research, updated to 29 March 2021. To our knowledge, this is the first review summarizing the whole current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 spreading among children and adolescents in the school setting, providing a worldwide overview in such a pandemic context.

34367445	Improper disposal of face masks during COVID-19: unheeded public health threat. Ethiopia confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in March 2020. As a means to tackle the spread of the virus, the government opened a campaign for the public to exercise hygiene measures such as washing hands frequently and physical distancing. A few weeks later, a five-month State of Emergency (SOE) was declared, and several businesses, schools and theatre halls were closed. People were advised to work from home, including permitting telecommuting for many government officials. However, mainly due to fear of economic crisis, the government was forced to release the lockdown and mass wearing of face masks has become a requirement. As health professionals and the government insist that people make use of facemasks, it is also equally important to give guidance on how to dispose of them safely because face masks that are disposed improperly have the potential in spreading SARS-CoV-2. The urgency of this comes in people's violations of rules when it comes to disposing of masks they used. Providing awareness creation programs about the negative impact of contaminated face masks on the health of individuals and introducing laws that can prohibit improper disposal of used personal protective equipment (PPEs) are among the solutions discussed in this manuscript that could help reduce the problem.

34341358	Malignant cerebral infarction after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination: a catastrophic variant of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia with cerebral venous thrombosis is a syndrome recently described in young adults within two weeks from the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Here we report two cases of malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarct and thrombocytopenia 9-10 days following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. The two cases arrived in our facility around the same time but from different geographical areas, potentially excluding epidemiological links; meanwhile, no abnormality was found in the respective vaccine batches. Patient 1 was a 57-year-old woman who underwent decompressive craniectomy despite two prior, successful mechanical thrombectomies. Patient 2 was a 55-year-old woman who developed a fatal bilateral malignant MCA infarct. Both patients manifested pulmonary and portal vein thrombosis and high level of antibodies to platelet factor 4-polyanion complexes. None of the patients had ever received heparin in the past before stroke onset. Our observations of rare arterial thrombosis may contribute to assessment of possible adverse effects associated with COVID-19 vaccination.	Case Report
34281000	Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection among Healthcare Workers of a German COVID-19 Treatment Center. To date, more than 160 million people have been infected with COVID-19 worldwide. In the present study, we investigated the history of SARS-CoV-2 infection among 3067 healthcare workers (HCW) in a German COVID-19 treatment center during the early phase of the pandemic (July 2020) based on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and self-reported previous PCR results. The results demonstrate a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 107 [3.5%]) with no increased risk for employees with a high level of patient exposure in general or working in COVID-19-confined areas in particular. This suggests that the local hygiene standards implemented in our hospital during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic were effective in preventing patient-to-HCW transmission. No evidence for highly mobile staff serving as a vector for SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be found. In addition, impairment of smell and/or taste was strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 history.

34226782	Docking-based virtual screening and identification of potential COVID-19 main protease inhibitors from brown algae. COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is a viral disease that causes acute respiratory syndrome, which has increased the morbidity and mortality rate throughout the world. World Health Organization has declared this COVID-19 outbreak as pandemic and classified health emergency throughout the world. In the recent past, outbreaks of SARS and MERS have shown the interspecies transmission potential of coronaviruses and limitations of already prescribed drugs to overcome this global public health issue. Therefore, there is a dire need to identify a new regimen of targeted drugs from natural compounds having anti-COVID19 potential. This study aimed at screening 1018 brown algal natural compounds (many of them previously reported to have immunomodulatory effects) having probable anti-COVID19 potentials. The source compounds were extracted from MarinLit, a database dedicated to marine natural products and screened against COVID-19 main protease. The top seven compounds were further analysed, and their interactions with the active site were visualized. This study will further warrant screening the potent compounds against the virus in in-vitro conditions.	Mechanism;Treatment
34131124	Insights into household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from a population-based serological survey. Understanding the risk of infection from household- and community-exposures and the transmissibility of asymptomatic infections is critical to SARS-CoV-2 control. Limited previous evidence is based primarily on virologic testing, which disproportionately misses mild and asymptomatic infections. Serologic measures are more likely to capture all previously infected individuals. We apply household transmission models to data from a cross-sectional, household-based population serosurvey of 4,534 people >/=5 years from 2,267 households enrolled April-June 2020 in Geneva, Switzerland. We found that the risk of infection from exposure to a single infected household member aged >/=5 years (17.3%,13.7-21.7) was more than three-times that of extra-household exposures over the first pandemic wave (5.1%,4.5-5.8). Young children had a lower risk of infection from household members. Working-age adults had the highest extra-household infection risk. Seropositive asymptomatic household members had 69.4% lower odds (95%CrI,31.8-88.8%) of infecting another household member compared to those reporting symptoms, accounting for 14.5% (95%CrI, 7.2-22.7%) of all household infections.

34214498	Famotidine inhibits toll-like receptor 3-mediated inflammatory signaling in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Apart from prevention using vaccinations, the management options for COVID-19 remain limited. In retrospective cohort studies, use of famotidine, a specific oral H2 receptor antagonist (antihistamine), has been associated with reduced risk of intubation and death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In a case series, nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 experienced rapid symptom resolution after taking famotidine, but the molecular basis of these observations remains elusive. Here we show using biochemical, cellular, and functional assays that famotidine has no effect on viral replication or viral protease activity. However, famotidine can affect histamine-induced signaling processes in infected Caco2 cells. Specifically, famotidine treatment inhibits histamine-induced expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and can reduce TLR3-dependent signaling processes that culminate in activation of IRF3 and the NF-kappaB pathway, subsequently controlling antiviral and inflammatory responses. SARS-CoV-2-infected cells treated with famotidine demonstrate reduced expression levels of the inflammatory mediators CCL-2 and IL6, drivers of the cytokine release syndrome that precipitates poor outcome for patients with COVID-19. Given that pharmacokinetic studies indicate that famotidine can reach concentrations in blood that suffice to antagonize histamine H2 receptors expressed in mast cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils, these observations explain how famotidine may contribute to the reduced histamine-induced inflammation and cytokine release, thereby improving the outcome for patients with COVID-19.

34344552	Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins using isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry. The emergence and subsequent global outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 prompted our laboratory to launch efforts to develop methods for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection and quantification. We present an isotope dilution mass spectrometry method (IDMS) for rapid and accurate quantification of the primary antigens, spike and nucleocapsid proteins. This IDMS method utilizes liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to analyze sample tryptic digests for detection and quantification of selected conserved peptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. The IDMS method has the necessary attributes to be successfully utilized for accurate quantification in SARS-CoV-2 protein-based vaccines and as targets of rapid diagnostic tests. Absolute quantification was achieved by quantifying and averaging 5 peptides for spike protein (3 peptides in the S1 subunit and 2 peptides in the S2 subunit) and 4 peptides for nucleocapsid protein. The overall relative standard deviation of the method was 3.67% for spike protein and 5.11% for nucleocapsid protein. IDMS offers speed (5 h total analysis time), sensitivity (LOQ; 10 fmol/microL) and precision for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins.	Diagnosis
34227439	Clinico-pathological features in fatal COVID-19 infection: a preliminary experience of a tertiary care center in North India using postmortem minimally invasive tissue sampling. OBJECTIVES: To study the histopathology of patients dying of COVID-19 using post-mortem minimally invasive sampling techniques. METHODS: This was a single-center observational study conducted at JPNATC, AIIMS. Thirty-seven patients who died of COVID-19 were enrolled. Post-mortem percutaneous biopsies were taken from lung, heart, liver, kidney and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemistry was performed using CD61 and CD163. SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected using IHC with primary antibodies. RESULTS: The mean age was 48.7 years and 59.5% were males. Lung histopathology showed diffuse alveolar damage in 78% patients. Associated bronchopneumonia was seen in 37.5% and scattered microthrombi in 21% patients. Immunopositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was observed in Type II pneumocytes. Acute tubular injury with epithelial vacuolization was seen in 46% of renal biopsies. Seventy-one percent of liver biopsies showed Kupffer cell hyperplasia and 27.5% showed submassive hepatic necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Predominant finding was diffuse alveolar damage with demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 protein in the acute phase. Microvascular thrombi were rarely identified in any organ. Substantial hepatocyte necrosis, Kupffer cell hypertrophy, microvesicular, and macrovesicular steatosis unrelated to microvascular thrombi suggested that liver might be a primary target of COVID-19.

34219808	3CL(pro) and PL(pro) affinity, a docking study to fight COVID19 based on 900 compounds from PubChem and literature. Are there new drugs to be found? The spread of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and a resulting COVID19 disease in late 2019 has transformed into a worldwide pandemic and has effectively brought the world to a halt. Proteases 3CL(pro) and PL(pro), responsible for proteolysis of new virions, represent vital inhibition targets for the COVID19 treatment. Herein, we report an in silico docking study of more than 860 COVID19-related compounds from the PubChem database. Molecular dynamic simulations were carried out to validate the conformation stability of compound-ligand complexes with best docking scores. The MM-PBSA approach was employed to calculate binding free energies. The comparison with ca. 50 previously reported potential SARS-CoV-2's proteases inhibitors show a number of new compounds with excellent binding affinities. Anti-inflammatory drugs Montelukast, Ebastine and Solumedrol, the anti-migraine drug Vazegepant or the anti-MRSA pro-drug TAK-599, among many others, all show remarkable affinities to 3CL(pro) and with known side effects present candidates for immediate clinical trials. This study reports thorough docking scores summary of COVID19-related compounds found in the PubChem database and illustrates the asset of computational screening methods in search for possible drug-like candidates. Several yet-untested compounds show affinities on par with reported inhibitors and warrant further attention. Furthermore, the submitted work provides readers with ADME data, ZINC and PubChem IDs, as well as docking scores of all studied compounds for further comparisons.	Mechanism;Treatment
34212752	Raising awareness about the unintended consequences of hand sanitiser in children. The use of hand sanitisers is common practice to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the safety thereof requires consideration as this may be hazardous in children. Recent studies have shown that the misuse and increased unsupervised availability of alcohol-based hand sanitisers may result in adverse events in children such as skin irritation, dryness, cracking and peeling. Unintentional or intentional ingestion of hand sanitisers in children under the age of 12 years may occur because of the colour, smell and flavour added to it. Consumption of alcohol in children may result in hypoglycaemia, apnoea and acidosis. This allows the invasion of other bacterial and viral infections. Children may also rub their eyes with sanitised hands and cause ocular injury. Therefore, the use of hand sanitisers in general needs to be revised in both children and adults. Other interventions on lowering the risk of adverse events because of misuse of hand sanitiser should be practised more often. These include promoting washing of hands over sanitisers where possible, training children on how to use hand sanitisers and creating awareness of the dangers if ingested or in contact with the eyes.

34335014	Recent updates on the possible reasons for the low incidence and morbidity of COVID-19 cases in Africa. Background: The COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide since the first reported case in Wuhan, China. A year has passed since pandemic began, and the reasons for different COVID-19 burden variation across continents keep puzzling the general public. Main body of the abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, published research articles have addressed the epidemiological risk factors, host factors, susceptibility and immunity. To ascertain possible reasons for the different rates of COVID-19 infections between Africa and other continents, we summarized the up-to-date scientific literature to identify possible arguments in this regard. Available literature suggests that demographic, epidemiological, sociological, genetic and immunological factors contribute in the COVID-19 severity and the susceptibly to SARS-CoV-2. Short conclusion: This review summarizes existing data and discusses reasons for differential COVID-19 burden across continents. The arguments mentioned herein will be helpful to guide future experimental studies to test different hypotheses.	Mechanism
34374355	Clinical Evaluation of the Rapid STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test for the Screening of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. Standard tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detect the presence of viral RNA using real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCR. Recently, convenient, rapid, and relatively inexpensive SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) detection methods have been developed. The STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test (SD Biosensor, Inc., Suwon, Korea) is a rapid immunochromatography test that qualitatively detects the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 using gold conjugated antibodies. We evaluated its performance in comparison with that of Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) in a retrospective case-control study using residual samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test were 89.2% (58/65) and 96.0% (96/100), respectively. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for the three target SARS-CoV-2 genes (envelope, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and nucleocapsid genes) included in Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay were significantly lower in Ag test-positive patients than in Ag test-negative patients (P<0.001). The Ag test sensitivity was higher in samples with Ct</=30 and those collected one to five days post symptom onset. In conclusion, the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test can serve as an alternative in high-prevalence settings, when the low sensitivity is compensated or when rRT-PCR tests are limited.	Diagnosis
34133030	The pandemic and the problem of compliance with safety measures: The case of Egypt. Analysing data from a nationally representative sample of 3442 interviews conducted in Egypt in 2020, this study examines the influence of four sets of factors in predicting compliance with the advice of healthcare professionals to combat the spread of COVID-19: demographics, knowledge and values, fear of the disease and denial, and the pandemic as a foreign invasion. The findings show that a higher likelihood of compliance is linked to socioeconomic status, awareness of the pandemic, reliance on a plurality of information sources, adherence to liberal values, and fear of the disease, but being male, young, employed, religious, fatalistic, and in denial of the severity of the pandemic lower this likelihood - all consistent with the results reported in the literature. In addition, this study highlights the link between compliance and such attributes of nationalism as national identity, national pride, the perception of the pandemic as a national event, and the willingness to sacrifice one's human right to combat the spread of the disease. Drawing on these factors, this paper suggests building societal consensus around the theme of national unity against the microparasitic invasion is the key to an effective strategy to combat the spread of the virus.

34227870	Knowledge, Attitudes, and Perceptions of COVID-19 among Healthcare and Non-Healthcare Workers in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Web-Based Survey. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic and associated high mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, there is panic amongst healthcare workers because of the higher risk of being infected. This study compared knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (non-HCWs) and examined common associated factors. A web-based cross-sectional study of 1,871 respondents (430 HCWs and 1,441 non-HCWs) was conducted while lockdown measures were in place in 4 regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Data were obtained using a validated self-administered questionnaire via an online survey platform. Mean scores were calculated and summarized using a t test for both groups. Multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the unadjusted (B) and adjusted coefficients (beta) with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%. The mean scores were slightly higher among HCWs than non-HCWs, but not statistically significant. Being worried about contracting COVID-19 was the only common factor associated with knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions between the 2 groups. Knowledge of COVID-19 was associated with attitudes and perceptions between the 2 groups. Other significant associated factors were: the sub-Saharan Africa region, ages 29 to 38 years (beta = .32; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.60 for knowledge among non-HCWs), education (beta = -.43; 95% CI, -0.81 to -0.04; and beta = -.95; 95% CI, -1.69 to -0.22, for knowledge among non-HCWs and HCWs, respectively), practice of self-isolation (beta = .71; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.02 for attitude among non-HCWs and HCWs (beta = .97; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.49), and home quarantine due to COVID-19, in both groups. Policymakers and healthcare providers should consider these factors when targeting interventions during COVID-19 and other future pandemics.	Prevention
34202895	Role of Non-Invasive Respiratory Supports in COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Failure Patients with Do Not Intubate Orders. The current gold-standard treatment for COVID-19-related hypoxemic respiratory failure is invasive mechanical ventilation. However, do not intubate orders (DNI), prevent the use of this treatment in some cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate if non-invasive ventilatory supports can provide a good therapeutic alternative to invasive ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and a DNI. Data were collected from four centres in three European countries. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection were included. We emulated a hypothetical target trial in which outcomes were compared in patients with a DNI order treated exclusively by non-invasive respiratory support with patients who could be intubated if necessary. We set up a propensity score and an inverse probability of treatment weighting to remove confounding by indication. Four-hundred patients were included: 270 were eligible for intubation and 130 had a DNI order. The adjusted risk ratio for death among patients eligible for intubation was 0.81 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.42). The median length of stay in acute care for survivors was similar between groups (18 (10-31) vs. (19 (13-23.5); p = 0.76). The use of non-invasive respiratory support is a good compromise for patients with severe COVID-19 and a do not intubate order.	Treatment

34281568	Post-infection cognitive impairments in a cohort of elderly patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Understanding the long-term effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on cognitive function is essential for monitoring the cognitive decline in the elderly population. This study aims to assess the current cognitive status and the longitudinal cognitive decline in elderly patients recovered from COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 1539 COVID-19 inpatients aged over 60 years who were discharged from three COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhan, China, from February 10 to April 10, 2020. In total, 466 uninfected spouses of COVID-19 patients were selected as controls. The current cognitive status was assessed using a Chinese version of the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status-40 (TICS-40) and the longitudinal cognitive decline was assessed using an Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Cognitive assessments were performed 6 months after patient discharge. RESULTS: Compared with controls, COVID-19 patients had lower TICS-40 scores and higher IQCODE scores [TICS-40 median (IQR): 29 (25 to 32) vs. 30 (26 to 33), p < 0.001; IQCODE median (IQR): 3.19 (3.00 to 3.63) vs. 3.06 (3.00 to 3.38), p < 0.001]. Severe COVID-19 patients had lower TICS-40 scores and higher IQCODE scores than non-severe COVID-19 patients [TICS-40 median (IQR): 24 (18 to 28) vs. 30 (26 to 33), p < 0.001; IQCODE median (IQR): 3.63 (3.13 to 4.31) vs. 3.13 (3.00 to 3.56), p < 0.001] and controls [TICS-40 median (IQR): 24 (18 to 28) vs. 30 (26 to 33), p < 0.001; IQCODE median (IQR) 3.63 (3.13 to 4.31) vs. 3.06 (3.00 to 3.38), p < 0.001]. Severe COVID-19 patients had a higher proportion of cases with current cognitive impairment and longitudinal cognitive decline than non-severe COVID-19 patients [dementia: 25 (10.50 %) vs. 9 (0.69 %), p < 0.001; Mild cognitive impairment (MCI): 60 (25.21 %) vs. 63 (4.84 %), p < 0.001] and controls [dementia: 25 (10.50 %) vs. 0 (0 %), p < 0.001; MCI: 60 (25.21 %) vs. 20 (4.29 %), p < 0.001)]. COVID-19 severity, delirium and COPD were risk factors of current cognitive impairment. Low education level, severe COVID-19, delirium, hypertension and COPD were risk factors of longitudinal cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with an increased risk of long-term cognitive decline in elderly population. COVID-19 patients, especially severe patients, should be intensively monitored for post-infection cognitive decline.	Diagnosis

34217220	Pre-existing cardiovascular disease rather than cardiovascular risk factors drives mortality in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The relative association between cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, established CV disease (CVD), and susceptibility to CV complications or mortality in COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of consecutive adults hospitalised for severe COVID-19 between 1st March and 30th June 2020. Pre-existing CVD, CV risk factors and associations with mortality and CV complications were ascertained. RESULTS: Among 1721 patients (median age 71 years, 57% male), 349 (20.3%) had pre-existing CVD (CVD), 888 (51.6%) had CV risk factors without CVD (RF-CVD), 484 (28.1%) had neither. Patients with CVD were older with a higher burden of non-CV comorbidities. During follow-up, 438 (25.5%) patients died: 37% with CVD, 25.7% with RF-CVD and 16.5% with neither. CVD was independently associated with in-hospital mortality among patients < 70 years of age (adjusted HR 2.43 [95% CI 1.16-5.07]), but not in those >/= 70 years (aHR 1.14 [95% CI 0.77-1.69]). RF-CVD were not independently associated with mortality in either age group (< 70 y aHR 1.21 [95% CI 0.72-2.01], >/= 70 y aHR 1.07 [95% CI 0.76-1.52]). Most CV complications occurred in patients with CVD (66%) versus RF-CVD (17%) or neither (11%; p < 0.001). 213 [12.4%] patients developed venous thromboembolism (VTE). CVD was not an independent predictor of VTE. CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, pre-existing established CVD appears to be a more important contributor to mortality than CV risk factors in the absence of CVD. CVD-related hazard may be mediated, in part, by new CV complications. Optimal care and vigilance for destabilised CVD are essential in this patient group. Trial registration n/a.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34218857	Post-COVID-19 Syndrome (Long Haul Syndrome): Description of a Multidisciplinary Clinic at Mayo Clinic and Characteristics of the Initial Patient Cohort. OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of a series of patients reporting prolonged symptoms after an infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study describes the multidisciplinary COVID-19 Activity Rehabilitation Program, established at Mayo Clinic to evaluate and treat patients with post-COVID syndrome, and reports the clinical characteristics of the first 100 patients receiving evaluation and management during the timeframe of June 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 100 patients (mean age, 45.4+/-14.2 years; 68% women; mean body mass index, 30.2 kg/m(2); presenting a mean of 93 days after infection). Common preexisting conditions were respiratory (23%) and mental health, including depression and/or anxiety (34%). Most (75%) had not been hospitalized for COVID-19. Common presenting symptoms ware fatigue (80%), respiratory complaints (59%), and neurological complaints (59%) followed by subjective cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, and mental health symptoms. More than one-third of patients (34%) reported difficulties in performing basic activities of daily living. Only 1 in 3 patients had returned to unrestricted work duty at the time of the analysis. For most patients, laboratory and imaging tests showed no abnormalities or were nondiagnostic despite debilitating symptoms. Most patients required physical therapy, occupational therapy, or brain rehabilitation. Face-to-face and virtual care delivery modalities were feasible. CONCLUSION: Most of the patients did not have COVID-19-related symptoms that were severe enough to require hospitalization, were younger than 65 years, and were more likely to be female, and most had no preexisting comorbidities before severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Symptoms including mood disorders, fatigue, and perceived cognitive impairment resulted in severe negative impacts on resumption of functional and occupational activities in patients experiencing prolonged effects.

34373443	Integrated single-cell analysis revealed immune dynamics during Ad5-nCoV immunization. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), driven by SARS-CoV-2, is a severe infectious disease that has become a global health threat. Vaccines are among the most effective public health tools for combating COVID-19. Immune status is critical for evaluating the safety and response to the vaccine, however, the evolution of the immune response during immunization remains poorly understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) represents a powerful tool for dissecting multicellular behavior and discovering therapeutic antibodies. Herein, by performing scRNA/V(D)J-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four COVID-19 vaccine trial participants longitudinally during immunization, we revealed enhanced cellular immunity with concerted and cell type-specific IFN responses as well as boosted humoral immunity with SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Based on the CDR3 sequence and germline enrichment, we were able to identify several potential binding antibodies. We synthesized, expressed and tested 21 clones from the identified lineages. Among them, one monoclonal antibody (P3V6-1) exhibited relatively high affinity with the extracellular domain of Spike protein, which might be a promising therapeutic reagent for COVID-19. Overall, our findings provide insights for assessing vaccine through the novel scRNA/V(D)J-seq approach, which might facilitate the development of more potent, durable and safe prophylactic vaccines.

34229034	Safety and structural integrity of N95/PFF2 respirators decontamination. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, an emerging respiratory pathogen. The work environment represents a high-risk factor for health professionals. Given the scarcity of protective personal equipment due to global demand, decontamination and reuse studies should be carried out. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of a method of decontamination of N95/PFF2 respirators, especially regarding structural integrity. METHODS: N95/PFF2 respirators were subjected to hydrogen peroxide decontamination and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Seven respirators of the same brand and lot were used, one being a control and the other six subjected to decontamination process. As for the sealing, a qualitative test was applied, in order to identify the changes in the structure that could damage the sealing of respirators. RESULTS: Indicated that the fiber morphology in all layers was not affected by the six decontamination cycles. Also, the thermal stability in the different layers was very similar. Fit testing showed that the respiradors submitted to all cycles of decontamination were approved. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, it is possible to conclude that the hydrogen peroxide decontamination method is effective, since it does not alter the physical properties of the respirators.	Prevention
34220784	The First Molecular Characterization of Serbian SARS-CoV-2 Isolates From a Unique Early Second Wave in Europe. March 6, 2020 is considered as the official date of the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Serbia. In late spring and early summer 2020, Europe recorded a decline in the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsiding of the first wave. This trend lasted until the fall, when the second wave of the epidemic began to appear. Unlike the rest of Europe, Serbia was hit by the second wave of the epidemic a few months earlier. Already in June 2020, newly confirmed cases had risen exponentially. As the COVID-19 pandemic is the first pandemic in which there has been instant sharing of genomic information on isolates around the world, the aim of this study was to analyze whole SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Serbia, to identify circulating variants/clade/lineages, and to explore site-specific mutational patterns in the unique early second wave of the European epidemic. This analysis of Serbian isolates represents the first publication from Balkan countries, which demonstrates the importance of specificities of local transmission especially when preventive measures differ among countries. One hundred forty-eight different genome variants among 41 Serbian isolates were detected in this study. One unique and seven extremely rare mutations were identified, with locally specific continuous dominance of the 20D clade. At the same time, amino acid substitutions of newly identified variants of concern were found in our isolates from October 2020. Future research should be focused on functional characterization of novel mutations in order to understand the exact role of these variations.	Mechanism
34293141	Antibody status and cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults in three regions of France following the first lockdown and associated risk factors: a multicohort study. BACKGROUND: We aimed to estimate the seropositivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in May-June 2020 after the first lockdown period in adults living in three regions in France and to identify the associated risk factors. METHODS: Between 4 May 2020 and 23 June 2020, 16 000 participants in a survey on COVID-19 from an existing consortium of three general adult population cohorts living in the Ile-de-France (IDF) or Grand Est (GE) (two regions with high rate of COVID-19) or in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine (NA) (with a low rate) were randomly selected to take a dried-blood spot for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies assessment with three different serological methods (ClinicalTrial Identifier #NCT04392388). The primary outcome was a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG result against the spike protein of the virus (ELISA-S). Estimates were adjusted using sampling weights and post-stratification methods. Multiple imputation was used to infer the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with adjustments for imperfect tests accuracies. RESULTS: The analysis included 14 628 participants, 983 with a positive ELISA-S. The weighted estimates of seropositivity and cumulative incidence were 10.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 9.1%, 10.9%] and 11.4% (95% CI: 10.1%, 12.8%) in IDF, 9.0% (95% CI: 7.7%, 10.2%) and 9.8% (95% CI: 8.1%, 11.8%) in GE and 3.1% (95% CI: 2.4%, 3.7%) and 2.9% (95% CI: 2.1%, 3.8%) in NA, respectively. Seropositivity was higher in younger participants [odds ratio (OR) = 1.84 (95% CI: 1.79, 6.09) in <40 vs 50-60 years old and OR = 0.56 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.74) in >/=70 vs 50-60 years old)] and when at least one child or adolescent lived in the same household [OR = 1.30 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.53)] and was lower in smokers compared with non-smokers [OR = 0.71 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.49)]. CONCLUSIONS: Seropositivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the French adult population was </=10% after the first wave. Modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors were identified.	Diagnosis
34201065	Impact of Prior Influenza and Pneumoccocal Vaccines on Humoral and Cellular Response to SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 Vaccination. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is considered the most effective method of prevention to contain the pandemic. While highly effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are being applied on a large-scale, whether and to what extent the strength of the vaccine-induced immune response could be further potentiated is still an object of debate. Several reports studied the effect of different vaccines on the susceptibility and mortality of COVID-19, with conflicting results. We aimed to evaluate whether previous influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccination had an impact on the specific immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. The study population consists of 710 workers from our Institute who completed the BNT162b2 schedule and have been tested at least once after the second dose, from 27 December 2020 up to 15 April 2021. Of these, 152 (21.4%) had received an influenza and 215 (30.3%) a concomitant influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, a median of 102 days before the second dose of BNT162b2. Overall, 100% of workers were tested for anti-Spike receptor-binding domain (anti-S/RBD) antibodies, 224 workers for neutralization titer (Micro-neutralization assay, MNA), and 155 workers for a spike-specific T cell interferon-gamma response (IFN-gamma). The levels of anti-S/RBD, MNA and IFN-gamma were evaluated and compared according to sex, age, involvement in direct care of COVID-19 patients, and previous influenza/pneumococcal vaccination. At the univariate analysis, no statistically significant association was observed with regard to a previous influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. A significant lower anti-S/RBD response was observed according to an older age and male sex, while MNA titers were significantly associated to sex but not to age. At the multivariable analysis, workers receiving a concomitant influenza and pneumococcal vaccination or only influenza showed a 58% (p 0.01) and 42% (p 0.07) increase in MNA titers, respectively, compared to those who did not receive an influenza/pneumococcal vaccination. Female workers showed an 81% MNA and a 44% anti-S/RBD increase compared to male workers (p < 0.001). Compared to workers aged 21 to 49 years, those aged 50 or older were associated with a reduction in the anti-S/RBD (16%; p 0.005), MNA (31%; p 0.019), and IFN.g (32%) immune response. Maintaining the influenza and pneumococcal immunization program for the coming season, in which COVID-19 could still be spreading, remains strongly recommended to protect those who are more vulnerable and to limit the potential burden of these infections on the healthcare system.

34221910	High throughput surface plasmon resonance imaging method for clinical detection of presence and strength of binding of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 during CoViD-19 infection. Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi) was used to determine the presence and strength of binding of IgG, IgM and IgA against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in sera of 102 CoViD-19 and non-CoViD-19 patients. The SPRi assay simultaneously measures the antibody isotype levels and the strength of binding to the RBD of ultimate 384 patient samples in one run. It turns out that during the course of the disease, the IgG levels and strength of binding increased while generally the IgM and IgA levels go down. Recovered patients all show high strength of binding of the IgG type to the RBD protein. The anti-RBD immunoglobulins SPRi assay provides additional insights in the immune status of patients recovering from CoViD-19. This new high throughput method can be applied for the assessment of the quality of the immune reaction of healthy individuals to SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants in vaccination programs.*Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging is an unprecedented technology for high throughput screening of antibody profiling of CoViD19 patients.*Fingerprinting of isotypes IgM, IgG and IgA can be performed for 384 patients in one run.*An affinity maturation effect was shown for patients recovering from CoViD19.

34227992	Extended Reality for Enhanced Telehealth During and Beyond COVID-19: Viewpoint. The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread challenges and revealed vulnerabilities across global health care systems. In response, many health care providers turned to telehealth solutions, which have been widely embraced and are likely to become standard for modern care. Immersive extended reality (XR) technologies have the potential to enhance telehealth with greater acceptability, engagement, and presence. However, numerous technical, logistic, and clinical barriers remain to the incorporation of XR technology into telehealth practice. COVID-19 may accelerate the union of XR and telehealth as researchers explore novel solutions to close social distances. In this viewpoint, we highlight research demonstrations of XR telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss future directions to make XR the next evolution of remote health care.	Prevention
34209845	Innate Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2 Infection: From Cells to Soluble Mediators. The vulnerability of humankind to SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of a pre-existing immunity, the unpredictability of the infection outcome, and the high transmissibility, broad tissue tropism, and ability to exploit and subvert the immune response pose a major challenge and are likely perpetuating the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, this peculiar infectious scenario provides researchers with a unique opportunity for studying, with the latest immunological techniques and understandings, the immune response in SARS-CoV-2 naive versus recovered subjects as well as in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinees. Interestingly, the current understanding of COVID-19 indicates that the combined action of innate immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines fine-tunes the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the related immunopathogenesis. Indeed, the emerging picture clearly shows that the excessive inflammatory response against this virus is among the main causes of disease severity in COVID-19 patients. In this review, the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is described not only in light of its capacity to influence the adaptive immune response towards a protective phenotype but also with the intent to point out the multiple strategies exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize host antiviral response and, finally, to outline inborn errors predisposing individuals to COVID-19 disease severity.

34284874	Neutrophils at the crossroads of acute viral infections and severity. Neutrophils are versatile immune effector cells essential for mounting a first-line defense against invading pathogens. However, uncontrolled activation can lead to severe life-threatening complications. Neutrophils exist as a heterogeneous population, and their interaction with pathogens and other immune cells may shape the outcome of the host immune response. Diverse classes of viruses, including the recently identified novel SARS-CoV-2, have shown to alter the various aspects of neutrophil biology, offering possibilities for selective intervention. Here, we review heterogeneity within the neutrophil population, highlighting the functional consequences of circulating phenotypes and their critical involvement in exaggerating protective and pathological immune responses against the viruses. We discuss the recent findings of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in COVID-19 pathology and cover other viruses, where neutrophil biology and NETs are crucial for developing disease severity. In the end, we have also pointed out the areas where neutrophil-mediated responses can be finely tuned to outline opportunities for therapeutic manipulation in controlling inflammation against viral infection.

34211257	Evidence-based approach to early outpatient treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. Misinformation and promotion of well-intended but disproved therapies for COVID-19 have plagued evidence-based shared decision-making throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. In times of crisis, clinicians may feel that their strong inclination to prescribe potentially harmful, unproven therapies on behalf of their patients is supported by beneficence. Clinicians should mindfully identify and avoid commission bias during this pandemic, especially as more data have accumulated to assist with clinically sound decision-making. We describe a more evidence-based approach to treatment of early outpatient COVID-19, stressing the availability of Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization therapies and considering plausibly beneficial, nonprescription supplements that are generally regarded as safe.

34222654	Impact of COVID-19 on Pharmaceutical Care Services and the Role of Community Pharmacists: A Multi-Center Cross-Sectional Study in Ethiopia. Objectives: The current study aimed at assessing the impact of COVID-19 on pharmaceutical care services and the role of community pharmacists. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1st to June 7, 2020, on community pharmacies in Bahir Dar and Gondar cities, Ethiopia. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were conducted. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered to declare statistical significance at a 95% Confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 101 community pharmacies were approached (one pharmacist per pharmacy), and 80 of them had completed the survey. From the total pharmacies, 78.8% of them had encountered a shortage of pharmaceutical products. Chi-square test revealed that there was a significant difference (P = 0.036) in the shortage of personal protection equipment between Gondar and Bahir Dar cities. Face mask 55 (77.4%) followed by hand glove 15 (21.1%) were the most commonly reported personal protective equipment's in short supply. Conclusion: Strategies should be in place to improve the availability and affordability of various essential pharmaceuticals to mitigate the spread of the disease and prevent other complications.

34345007	Identification, mapping and relative quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycopeptides by Mass-Retention Time Fingerprinting. We describe an analytical method for the identification, mapping and relative quantitation of glycopeptides from SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The method may be executed using a LC-TOF mass spectrometer, requires no specialized knowledge of glycan analysis and exploits the differential resolving power of reverse phase HPLC. While this separation technique resolves peptides with high efficiency, glycans are resolved poorly, if at all. Consequently, glycopeptides consisting of the same peptide bearing different glycan structures will all possess very similar retention times and co-elute. Rather than a disadvantage, we show that shared retention time can be used to map multiple glycan species to the same peptide and location. In combination with MSMS and pseudo MS3, we have constructed a detailed mass-retention time database for Spike glycopeptides. This database allows any accurate mass LC-MS laboratory to reliably identify and quantify Spike glycopeptides from a single overnight elastase digest in less than 90 minutes.	Diagnosis;Mechanism

The role of the emergency provider lies at the forefront of recognition and treatment of novel and re-emerging infectious diseases in children. Familiarity with disease presentations that might be considered rare, such as vaccine-preventable and non-endemic illnesses, is essential in identifying and controlling outbreaks. As we have seen thus far in the novel coronavirus pandemic, susceptibility, severity, transmission, and disease presentation can all have unique patterns in children. Emergency providers also have the potential to play a public health role by using lessons learned from the phenomena of vaccine hesitancy and refusal.	Prevention
34202849	Seroprevalence of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Blood Donors from Nuevo Leon State, Mexico, during 2020: A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Evaluation. The progression and distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are continuously changing over time and can be traced by blood donors' serological survey. Here, we investigated the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood donors in Nuevo Leon, Mexico during 2020 as a strategy for the rapid evaluation of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and asymptomatic case detection. We collected residual plasma samples from blood donors who attended two regional donation centers from January to December of 2020 to identify changes in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG prevalence. Plasma samples were analyzed on the Abbott Architect instrument using the commercial Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent assay. We found a total of 99 reactive samples from 2068 analyzed plasma samples, resulting in a raw prevalence of 4.87%. Donors aged 18-49 years were more likely to be seropositive compared to those aged >50 years (p < 0.001). Weekly seroprevalence increased from 1.8% during the early pandemic stage to 27.59% by the end of the year. Prevalence was 1.46-fold higher in females compared to males. Case geographical mapping showed that Monterrey city recorded the majority of SARS-CoV-2 cases. These results show that there is a growing trend of seroprevalence over time associated with asymptomatic infection that is unnoticed under the current epidemiological surveillance protocols.

34284539	Are central nervous system drugs displaying anti-inflammatory activity suitable for early treatment of COVID-19? The majority of COVID-19 cases are only mildly or moderately symptomatic, but in some patients excessive inflammatory response becomes the dominant factor of disease progression to the advanced stage, with high mortality. Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs either does not prevent disease progression (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], colchicine), or is recommended only at the advanced disease stage (dexamethasone). Fluvoxamine and amantadine are drugs used to treat neurological and psychiatric diseases. Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, whereas amantadine is an old antiviral variably influencing brain neurotransmitter systems, and repurposed to Parkinson's disease. Both drugs are agonists of sigma-1 receptors located in the endoplasmic reticulum, which effect seems responsible for their anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, amantadine was found to dampen the expression of cathepsin-L, a lysosomal enzyme implicated in SARS-CoV-2 virus entry to target cells. In two small controlled clinical trials, early treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected persons with fluvoxamine fully prevented COVID-19 symptoms. Anecdotal evidence shows that amantadine may be similarly effective. Both drugs are easily available, inexpensive and have favorable safety profiles. Clinical trials evaluating their efficacy as much-needed post-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment of COVID-19 are ongoing.	Treatment
34222812	Association of blood groups on the risk of COVID-19 infection, morbidity, and mortality. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the effects of blood groups and Rh factor on the development of coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) with all aspects such as clinical course, inflammatory parameters, and organ-specific biochemical parameters with a significant number of patients. METHODS: This multicenter study was carried out retrospectively on 3551 patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 and whose blood groups were recorded during the time of hospitalization. As control groups, 22133 individuals' medical data who were admitted to the blood bank affiliated with our hospitals during the last year was used. The differences between the blood groups and clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 3551 patients, A Rh (+) blood group was found to be in a higher ratio in the case group than controls, with increased risk to be infected (case: 41.3% vs. control: 38.8%), (OR 1.113; 95% CI: 1.036-1.197; p=0.003). Meanwhile O Rh (+) blood group ratios were significantly lower in the case group than in the control group (case: 26% vs. control: 28.3%) (OR 0.862; 95% CI: 0.823-0.966; p=0.005). There was no significant difference between blood groups in terms of admission to the intensive care units and mortality, it was observed that patients with AB Rh (+) blood group have a greater risk for intubation than others (OR: 1.467; 95% CI: 1.040-2.071; p=0.028). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that people with blood group A Rh (+) more susceptible to COVID-19, whereas blood group 0 Rh (+) have a protective effect against the infection. Once a person has been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, we should be mindful that patients with blood group AB Rh (+) would be prone to intubation more than other blood groups.

34222718	"The antiviral activity of iota-, kappa-, and lambda-carrageenan against COVID-19: A critical review. Objective: There is no specific antiviral treatment available for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among the possible natural constituents is carrageenan, a polymer derived from marine algae that possesses a variety of antiviral properties. The purpose of this review was to summarize the evidence supporting carrageenan subtypes' antiviral activity against the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar searches were conducted for publications using the terms 'carrageenan', 'iota carrageenan', 'kappa carrageenan', lambda-carrageenan', 'coronavirus', 'common cold', 'rhinovirus', and 'SARS-CoV-2' search was also done in grey literature to increase our understanding. A search for the word ""carrageenan"" was also carried out. Most of the publications were discussed in narrative. Results: Carrageenan has been shown to have potent antiviral activity against both coronaviruses (coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV-2) and non-coronaviruses such as dengue virus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, sindbis virus, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, human papillomavirus, rabies virus, junin virus, tacaribe virus, African swine fever, bovine herpes virus, suid herpes virus, and rhinovirus. No in vivo study has been conducted using carrageenan as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. The majority of the in vivo research was done on influenza, a respiratory virus that causes common cold together with coronavirus. Thus, various clinical trials were conducted to determine the transferability of these in vitro data to clinical effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2. When combined with oral ivermectin, nasally administered iota-carrageenan improved outcome in COVID-19 patients. It is still being tested in clinics for single-dose administration. Conclusion: Though the carrageenan exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and was used to treat COVID-19 under emergency protocol in conjunction with oral medications such as ivermectin, there is no solid evidence from clinical trials to support its efficacy. Thus, clinical trials are required to assess its efficacy for COVID-19 treatment prior to broad application."	Treatment
34217004	An outlook on antigen-specific adoptive immunotherapy for viral infections with a focus on COVID-19. Although not a standard-of-care yet, adoptive immunotherapeutic approaches have gradually earned a place within the list of antiviral therapies for some of fatal and hard-to-treat viral diseases. To maintain robust antiviral immunity and to effectively target the viral particles and virally-infected cells, immune cells capable of recognizing the viral antigens are required. While conventional vaccination can induce these cells in vivo; another option is to prime and generate antigen-specific immune cells ex vivo. This approach has been successfully trialed for virulent opportunistic viral infections after bone marrow transplantation. Amid the crisis of SARS-CoV2 pandemic, which has been followed by the success of certain early-authorized vaccines; some institutions and companies have explored the effects of viral-specific adoptive cell transfers (ACTs) in trials, as alternative treatments. Aimed at outlining a perspective on antigen-specific adoptive immunotherapy for viral infections, this review article specifically provides an appraisal of ACT-based studies/trials on SARS-CoV2 infection.

34223401	FDA-authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are effective per real-world evidence synthesized across a multi-state health system. Background: Two FDA-authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), have demonstrated high efficacies in large Phase 3 randomized clinical trials. It is important to assess their effectiveness in a real-world setting. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of 136,532 individuals in the Mayo Clinic health system (Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin) with PCR testing data between December 1, 2020 and April 20, 2021. We compared clinical outcomes for a vaccinated cohort of 68,266 individuals who received at least one dose of either vaccine (nBNT162b2 = 51,795; nmRNA-1273 = 16,471) and an unvaccinated control cohort of 68,266 individuals propensity-matched based on relevant demographic, clinical, and geographic features. We estimated real-world vaccine effectiveness by comparing incidence rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and COVID-19 associated hospitalization and ICU admission starting 7 days after the second vaccine dose. Findings: The real-world vaccine effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection was 86.1% (95% CI: 82.4-89.1%) for BNT162b2 and 93.3% (95% CI: 85.7-97.4%) for mRNA-1273. BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 were 88.8% (95% CI: 75.5-95.7%) and 86.0% (95% CI: 71.6-93.9%) effective in preventing COVID-19 associated hospitalization. Both vaccines were 100% effective (95% CIBNT162b2: 51.4-100%; 95% CImRNA-1273: 43.3-100%) in preventing COVID-19 associated ICU admission. Conclusions: BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are both effective in a real-world setting and are associated with reduced rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and decreased burden of COVID-19 on the healthcare system.

34220703	Covid-19 and Growth Hormone/Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1: Study in Critically and Non-Critically Ill Patients. Objective: We aimed to measure insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and growth hormone (GH) in critically and non-critically ill patients with Covid-19 and assess them vis-a-vis clinical and laboratory parameters and prognostic tools. Subjects and Methods: We included patients who were admitted to the wards or the ICU of the largest Covid-19 referral hospital in Greece; patients with non-Covid-19 pneumonia served as controls. Apart from the routine laboratory work-up for Covid-19 we measured GH and IGF1 (and calculated normalized IGF-1 values as standard deviation scores; SDS), after blood sampling upon admission to the wards or the ICU. Results: We studied 209 critically and non-critically ill patients with Covid-19 and 39 control patients. Patients with Covid-19 who were ICU non-survivors were older and presented with a worse hematological/biochemical profile (including white blood cell count, troponin, glucose, aminotransferases and lactate dehydrogenase) compared to ICU survivors or Covid-19 survivors in the wards. Overall, IGF-1 SDS was higher in Covid-19 survivors compared to non-survivors (-0.96 +/- 1.89 vs -2.05 +/- 2.48, respectively, p=0.030). No significant differences were noted in GH between the groups. Nevertheless, in critically ill patients with Covid-19, the prognostic value of IGF-1 (raw data), IGF-1 (SDS) and GH for survival/non-survival was on a par with that of APACHE II and SOFA (with a marginal difference between GH and SOFA). Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings suggest that there might be an association between low IGF1 (and possibly GH) and poor outcome in patients with Covid-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34215120	Catalytic hairpin DNA assembly-based chemiluminescent assay for the detection of short SARS-CoV-2 target cDNA. Colorimetric sensors are recognized as a promising means for target molecule detection as they provide rapid, cost-effective, and facile sensing visible to the naked eye. Challenges remain though in terms of their detection sensitivity and specificity for short-length target genes. Herein, we demonstrate the successful combination of the catalytic hairpin DNA assembly (CHA) approach with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-mimicking techniques for a simple, sensitive, and sequence-specific colorimetric assay to detect short SARS-CoV-2 target cDNA. In the developed CHA-based chemiluminescent assay, a low concentration of target cDNA is continuously recycled to amplify dimeric DNA probes from two biotinylated hairpin DNA until the hairpin DNA is completely consumed. The dimeric DNA probes are effectively immobilized in a neutravidin-coated microplate well and then capture neutravidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase via biotin-neutravidin interactions, resulting in a sensitive and selective colorless-to-blue color change. The developed sensing system exhibits a high sensitivity with a detection limit of ~1 nM for target cDNA as well as the ability to precisely distinguish a single-base mismatched mutant gene within 2 h. As the proposed system does not require complex protocols or expensive equipment to amplify target cDNA, it has the potential to be utilized as a powerful tool to improve the detection sensitivity of target genes for clinical diagnostics with colorimetric detection.

34344353	Associations of immunological features with COVID-19 severity: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread widely worldwide, causing millions of deaths. We aim to explore the association of immunological features with COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate mean difference (MD) of immune cells and cytokines levels with COVID-19 severity in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and the grey literature. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies with 2033 COVID-19 patients were included. Compared with mild cases, severe cases showed significantly lower levels of immune cells including CD3(+) T cell (x 10(6), MD, - 413.87; 95%CI, - 611.39 to - 216.34), CD4(+) T cell (x 10(6), MD, - 203.56; 95%CI, - 277.94 to - 129.18), CD8(+) T cell (x 10(6), MD, - 128.88; 95%CI, - 163.97 to - 93.79), B cell (x 10(6)/L; MD, - 23.87; 95%CI, - 43.97 to - 3.78) and NK cell (x 10(6)/L; MD, - 57.12; 95%CI, - 81.18 to - 33.06), and significantly higher levels of cytokines including TNF-alpha (pg/ml; MD, 0.34; 95%CI, 0.09 to 0.59), IL-5 (pg/ml; MD, 14.2; 95%CI, 3.99 to 24.4), IL-6 (pg/ml; MD, 13.07; 95%CI, 9.80 to 16.35), and IL-10 (pg/ml; MD, 2.04; 95%CI, 1.32 to 2.75), and significantly higher levels of chemokines as MCP-1 (SMD, 3.41; 95%CI, 2.42 to 4.40), IP-10 (SMD, 2.82; 95%CI, 1.20 to 4.45) and eotaxin (SMD, 1.55; 95%CI, 0.05 to 3.05). However, no significant difference was found in other indicators such as Treg cell (x 10(6), MD, - 0.13; 95%CI, - 1.40 to 1.14), CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio (MD, 0.26; 95%CI, - 0.02 to 0.55), IFN-gamma (pg/ml; MD, 0.26; 95%CI, - 0.05 to 0.56), IL-2 (pg/ml; MD, 0.05; 95%CI, - 0.49 to 0.60), IL-4 (pg/ml; MD, - 0.03; 95%CI, - 0.68 to 0.62), GM-CSF (SMD, 0.44; 95%CI, - 0.46 to 1.35), and RANTES (SMD, 0.94; 95%CI, - 2.88 to 4.75). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis revealed significantly lower levels of immune cells (CD3(+) T, CD4(+) T, CD8(+) T, B and NK cells), higher levels of cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10) and higher levels of chemokines (MCP-1, IP-10 and eotaxin) in severe cases in comparison to mild cases of COVID-19. Measurement of immunological features could help assess disease severity for effective triage of COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34360866	Acute Kidney Injury in COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly considered a respiratory illness, but since SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) to enter human cells, the kidney is also a target of the viral infection. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most alarming condition in COVID-19 patients. Recent studies have confirmed the direct entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the renal cells, namely podocytes and proximal tubular cells, but this is not the only pathomechanism of kidney damage. Hypovolemia, cytokine storm and collapsing glomerulopathy also play an important role. An increasing number of papers suggest a strong association between AKI development and higher mortality in COVID-19 patients, hence our interest in the matter. Although knowledge about the role of kidneys in SARS-CoV-2 infection is changing dynamically and is yet to be fully investigated, we present an insight into the possible pathomechanisms of AKI in COVID-19, its clinical features, risk factors, impact on hospitalization and possible ways for its management via renal replacement therapy.

34206932	Sample-Pooling Strategy for SARS-CoV-2 Detection among Students and Staff of the University of Sannio. Since the beginning of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, it has been clear that testing large groups of the population was the key to stem infection and prevent the effects of the coronavirus disease of 2019, mostly among sensitive patients. On the other hand, time and cost-sustainability of virus detection by molecular analysis such as reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) may be a major issue if testing is extended to large communities, mainly asymptomatic large communities. In this context, sample-pooling and test grouping could offer an effective solution. Here we report the screening on 1195 oral-nasopharyngeal swabs collected from students and staff of the Universita degli Studi del Sannio (University of Sannio, Benevento, Campania, Italy) and analyzed by an in-house developed multiplex RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection through a simple monodimensional sample pooling strategy. Overall, 400 distinct pools were generated and, within 24 h after swab collection, five positive samples were identified. Out of them, four were confirmed by using a commercially available kit suitable for in vitro diagnostic use (IVD). High accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were also determined by comparing our results with a reference IVD assay for all deconvoluted samples. Overall, we conducted 463 analyses instead of 1195, reducing testing resources by more than 60% without lengthening diagnosis time and without significant losses in sensitivity, suggesting that our strategy was successful in recognizing positive cases in a community of asymptomatic individuals with minor requirements of reagents and time when compared to normal testing procedures.

34201618	Machine Learning for Analyzing Non-Countermeasure Factors Affecting Early Spread of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the whole world, but not all countries were impacted equally. This opens the question of what factors can explain the initial faster spread in some countries compared to others. Many such factors are overshadowed by the effect of the countermeasures, so we studied the early phases of the infection when countermeasures had not yet taken place. We collected the most diverse dataset of potentially relevant factors and infection metrics to date for this task. Using it, we show the importance of different factors and factor categories as determined by both statistical methods and machine learning (ML) feature selection (FS) approaches. Factors related to culture (e.g., individualism, openness), development, and travel proved the most important. A more thorough factor analysis was then made using a novel rule discovery algorithm. We also show how interconnected these factors are and caution against relying on ML analysis in isolation. Importantly, we explore potential pitfalls found in the methodology of similar work and demonstrate their impact on COVID-19 data analysis. Our best models using the decision tree classifier can predict the infection class with roughly 80% accuracy.	Prevention
34218963	Trust in government, intention to vaccinate and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy: A comparative survey of five large cities in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. BACKGROUND: There is widespread hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 in five cities with varying COVID-19 incidence in the US, UK, and Australia. DESIGN: Online, cross-sectional survey of adults from Dynata's research panel in July-September 2020. PARTICIPANTS, SETTING: Adults aged 18 and over in Sydney, Melbourne, London, New York City, or Phoenix. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine; reason for vaccine intention. STATISTICAL METHODS: To identify predictors of intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, we used Poisson regression with robust error estimation to produce prevalence ratios. RESULTS: The proportion willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was 70% in London, 71% NYC, 72% in Sydney, 76% in Phoenix, and 78% in Melbourne. Age was the only sociodemographic characteristic that predicted willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in all five cities. In Sydney and Melbourne, participants with high confidence in their current government had greater willingness to receive the vaccine (PR=1.24; 95% CI=1.07-1.44 and PR=1.38; 95% CI=1.74-1.62), while participants with high confidence in their current government in NYC and Phoenix were less likely to be willing to receive the vaccine (PR=0.78; 95% CI=0.72-0.85 and PR=0.85; 95% CI=0.76-0.96). LIMITATIONS: Consumer panels can be subject to bias and may not be representative of the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Success for COVID-19 vaccination programs requires high levels of vaccine acceptance. Our data suggests more than 25% of adults may not be willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, but many of them were not explicitly anti-vaccination and thus may become more willing to vaccinate over time. Among the three countries surveyed, there appears to be cultural differences, political influences, and differing experiences with COVID-19 that may affect willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

34213849	Structure-function relations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and impact of mutations in the variants of concern. This review covers the main features of the severe acquired respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein, its interaction with the main entry receptor, the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the subsequent membrane fusion step. The focus is on the structural organization of these proteins and mechanistic aspects of their interactions that lead to cytoplasmic release of the viral genome. The most potently neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were shown to interfere with the spike/ACE2 interaction. I thus also review the location and the potential impact of mutations in the spike protein observed in the variants of concern that emerged concomitantly with acquired immunity in the population after one year of virus circulation. Understanding how these interactions affect the spike/ACE2 interactions and the subsequent spike-protein-induced membrane fusion reaction is important to stay one step ahead of the virus evolution and develop efficient countermeasures.

34201797	Dexamethasone for Severe COVID-19: How Does It Work at Cellular and Molecular Levels? The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection of the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) significantly impacted human society. Recently, the synthetic pure glucocorticoid dexamethasone was identified as an effective compound for treatment of severe COVID-19. However, glucocorticoids are generally harmful for infectious diseases, such as bacterial sepsis and severe influenza pneumonia, which can develop respiratory failure and systemic inflammation similar to COVID-19. This apparent inconsistency suggests the presence of pathologic mechanism(s) unique to COVID-19 that renders this steroid effective. We review plausible mechanisms and advance the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection is accompanied by infected cell-specific glucocorticoid insensitivity as reported for some other viruses. This alteration in local glucocorticoid actions interferes with undesired glucocorticoid to facilitate viral replication but does not affect desired anti-inflammatory properties in non-infected organs/tissues. We postulate that the virus coincidentally causes glucocorticoid insensitivity in the process of modulating host cell activities for promoting its replication in infected cells. We explore this tenet focusing on SARS-CoV-2-encoding proteins and potential molecular mechanisms supporting this hypothetical glucocorticoid insensitivity unique to COVID-19 but not characteristic of other life-threatening viral diseases, probably due to a difference in specific virally-encoded molecules and host cell activities modulated by them.

34219582	Effect of the unfavorable maternal-fetal environment cause by mitigation measures of the covid-19 pandemic in the public maternity of reference of Uruguay. INTRODUCTION: The mitigation measures to face the health emergency due to the COVID 19 pandemic generated a deep economic, social, and psychological crisis at the community level. This effect is greater in the people, who are the most violated in their rights. In relation to the social crisis and gender perspective, women are particularly affected by the pandemic. Given the disadvantaged situation of women socially, economically, and politically, their self-care is diminished. OBJECTIVE: To identify whether there is an association between the classic risk factors for prematurity and fetal growth restriction and the increase in these pathologies in the period March-September 2020, in a maternity hospital that assists women from low resources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study, with a comparative analysis of the periods between 15 March and 30 September 2019 and the same period in 2020. The data were obtained from an electronic clinical database. The prevalence of preterm birth and small-for-gestational age newborn was analyzed. Indicators available in the database that reflect maternal conditions that lead to an unfavorable maternal environment were selected and they were classified into categories. RESULTS: In the period of 2019, 3225 births were registered and in the period of 2020, 3036 births. In the 2019 period, 12.2% of prematurity was evidenced, while in the 2020 period, 14.5% (RR = 1.19, IC 95% = 1.05-1.35, p = .005). In relation to PEG 5.5% in the first period versus 6.9% in the second (RR = 1.26, CI 95% = 1.04-1.53, p = .01). No increases were found in the indicators that are traditionally related to the etiologies proposed to explain the increase in prematurity and small-for-age gestational, there was no evidence of an increase in inflammatory or vascular conditions. CONCLUSION: The economic, psychological and social crises, in the 1st semester of the health emergency, seriously affected the social determinants of the health of pregnant women who use the Public Maternity of reference in Uruguay. This situation is at the base of the poor perinatal results in the period of the maximum mediated mitigation of the pandemic.	Prevention
34203888	A Case Study of Using Telehealth in a Rural Healthcare Facility to Expand Services and Protect the Health and Safety of Patients and Staff. This case study aimed to gain an understanding of the implementation and usage of a telehealth program during the COVID-19 pandemic at a rural healthcare facility. An action research methodology, utilizing cycles of planning, implementation, review and adaptation was adopted to improve use of telehealth as COVID-19 cases continued to increase. Data was collected from literature review, examination of existing documents, review of gap and SWOT analysis, and examination of staffing plans. This helped in ensuring that adequate resources were in place to start and continue usage of telehealth. Additionally, review of the entire process was conducted as the program advanced through various phases of implementation. By conducting rigorous analysis and reflection, these data informed cycles of improvement in the telehealth program. Challenges surrounding the continuation and usage of telehealth have also been described. Because there is a paucity of research on the use of telehealth programs in rural healthcare facilities, especially during the pandemic, this study can provide practical tips to leaders and healthcare managers.

34215337	Racial and ethnic disparities in viral acute respiratory infections in the United States: protocol of a systematic review. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted consistent inequities in incidence, disease severity, and mortality across racial and ethnic minority populations in the United States (US) and beyond. While similar patterns have been observed with previous viral respiratory pathogens, to date, no systematic review has comprehensively documented these disparities or potential contributing factors. In response, this review aims to synthesize data on racial and ethnic disparities in morbidity and mortality due to viral acute respiratory infections (ARI) other than SARS-CoV-2. This review will focus on understanding structural health and social factors to contextualize race and ethnicity driving these disparities in the US. METHODS: We will conduct a systematic review of studies published from January 1, 2002, onward. Our search will include PubMed/MEDLINE, EBSCO Host-CINAHL Plus, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases to identify relevant articles. We will include studies of any design that describe racial/ethnic disparities associated with viral ARI conducted in the US. Primary outcomes include incidence, disease severity or complication, hospitalization, or death attributed to ARI. Secondary outcomes include uptake of preventive interventions including vaccination, handwashing, social distancing, and wearing masks. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract relevant data. Data characterizing individual-, community-, and structural-level factors associated with these disparities will be abstracted to better understand the underlying structural inequities contributing to racial disparities in ARI. We will assess the methodological quality of all studies and will conduct meta-analyses using random effects models if appropriate. DISCUSSION: Findings from this systematic review will shed light on patterns of racial and ethnic disparities in viral ARI in the United States to support mathematical modeling of epidemic trajectories, intervention impact, and structural drivers of transmission, including structural racism. Moreover, data emerging from this review may reignite pandemic preparedness focused on communities with specific vulnerabilities related to living and working conditions given prevailing structural inequities, thus facilitating improved future pandemic responses to novel or endemic viral respiratory pathogens.

34375345	Longitudinal analysis to characterize classes and subclasses of antibody responses to recombinant receptor-binding protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients in Thailand. Serological assays to detect antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might contribute to confirming the suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients not detected with molecular assays. Human antibodies that target the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-binding domain of the viral spike protein are a target for serodiagnosis and therapeutics. This study aimed to characterize the classes and subclasses of antibody responses to a recombinant receptor-binding protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients and investigated the reactivity of these antibodies in patients with other tropical infections and healthy individuals in Thailand. ELISAs for IgM, IgA, IgG and IgG subclasses based on RBD antigen were developed and tested with time series of 27 serum samples from 15 patients with COVID-19 and 60 samples from pre-COVID-19 outbreaks including acute dengue fever, murine typhus, influenza, leptospirosis and healthy individuals. Both RBD-specific IgA and IgG were detected in only 21% of the COVID-19 patients in the acute phase. The median IgA and IgG levels were significantly higher in the convalescent serum sample compared to the acute serum sample (P < 0.05). We observed the highest correlation between levels of IgG and IgA (rho = 0. 92). IgG1 and IgG3 were the major IgG subclasses detected in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only acute IgG3 level was negatively associated with viral detection based on RT-PCR of ORF1ab gene (rho = -0.57). The median IgA and IgG levels in convalescence sera of COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than healthy individuals and convalescent sera of other febrile infectious patients. The analyses of antibody classes and subclasses provide insights into human immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 during natural infection and interpretation of antibody assays.

34203977	Bioactive Polyphenolic Compounds Showing Strong Antiviral Activities against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. Until now, there has been no direct evidence of the effectiveness of repurposed FDA-approved drugs against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Although curcumin, hesperidin, and quercetin have broad spectra of pharmacological properties, their antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. Our study aimed to assess the in vitro antiviral activities of curcumin, hesperidin, and quercetin against SARS-CoV-2 compared to hydroxychloroquine and determine their mode of action. In Vero E6 cells, these compounds significantly inhibited virus replication, mainly as virucidal agents primarily indicating their potential activity at the early stage of viral infection. To investigate the mechanism of action of the tested compounds, molecular docking studies were carried out against both SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and main protease (Mpro) receptors. Collectively, the obtained in silico and in vitro findings suggest that the compounds could be promising SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. We recommend further preclinical and clinical studies on the studied compounds to find a potential therapeutic targeting COVID-19 in the near future.	Mechanism;Treatment
34208017	Clinical Course and Risk Factors for In-Hospital Mortality of 205 Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia in Como, Lombardy Region, Italy. The aim of this study is to explore risk factors for in-hospital mortality and describe the effectiveness of different treatment strategies of 205 laboratory-confirmed cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the Lombardy outbreak. All patients received the best supportive care and specific interventions that included the main drugs being tested for repurposing to treat COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, anticoagulation and antiviral drugs, steroids, and interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment characteristics were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods to explore their impact on in-hospital mortality. Univariate analyses showed prognostic significance for age greater than 70 years, the presence of two or more relevant comorbidities, a P/F ratio less than 200 at presentation, elevated LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and CRP (C-reactive protein) values, intermediate- or therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, hydroxychloroquine, early antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir, short courses of steroids, and tocilizumab therapy. Multivariable regression confirmed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with age older than 70 years (OR 3.26) and a reduction in mortality for patients treated with anticoagulant (-0.37), antiviral lopinavir/ritonavir (-1.22), or steroid (-0.59) therapy. In contrast, hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have not been confirmed to have a significant effect in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Results from this real-life single-center experience are in agreement and confirm actual literature data on SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in terms of both clinical risk factors for in-hospital mortality and the effectiveness of the different therapies proposed for the management of COVID19 disease.

34286401	Impact of COVID-19 on gastric cancer treatment in Japanese high-volume centers: a JCOG stomach cancer study group survey. PURPOSES: The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected socioeconomic and healthcare systems in many countries. Accordingly, many individuals may have canceled their annual health-check programs, including esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which would have resulted in lower numbers of newly diagnosed patients with gastric cancer in comparison to other times. METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed to 62 hospitals every week from May 2020 to August 2020 (total 744) through mailing lists of the Stomach Cancer Study Group of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group. The number of patients with gastric cancer and hospital systems during the COVID-19 pandemic were surveyed. RESULTS: In total, 74% (551 out of 744) of the questionnaires were answered and analyzed. In early May, approximately 50% of hospitals had to restrict surgical slots due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they gradually loosened the restrictions thereafter. The number of gastrectomies was < 80% that of the same period in the previous year, and hospitals in Tokyo were seriously affected by a 50% decrease in the number of gastrectomies. CONCLUSIONS: The number of gastrectomies was lower than that in the previous year. Further multi-center follow-up studies are required to evaluate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the clinical outcomes of patients with gastric cancer.	Prevention
34362979	Evidence for a thromboembolic pathogenesis of lung cavitations in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induces lung injury of varying severity, potentially causing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Pulmonary injury patterns in COVID-19 patients differ from those in patients with other causes of ARDS. We aimed to explore the frequency and pathogenesis of cavitary lung lesions in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Retrospective study in 39 critically ill adult patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 including lung injury of varying severity in a tertiary care referral center during March and May 2020, Berlin/Germany. We observed lung cavitations in an unusually large proportion of 22/39 (56%) COVID-19 patients treated on intensive care units (ICU), including 3/5 patients without mechanical ventilation. Median interquartile range (IQR) time between onset of symptoms and ICU admission was 11.5 (6.25-17.75) days. In 15 patients, lung cavitations were already present on the first CT scan, performed after ICU admission; in seven patients they developed during a subsequent median (IQR) observation period of 48 (35-58) days. In seven patients we found at least one cavitation with a diameter > 2 cm (maximum 10 cm). Patients who developed cavitations were older and had a higher body mass index. Autopsy findings in three patients revealed that the cavitations reflected lung infarcts undergoing liquefaction, secondary to thrombotic pulmonary artery branch occlusions. Lung cavitations appear to be a frequent complication of severely ill COVID-19 patients, probably related to the prothrombotic state associated with COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34199077	From Recoding to Peptides for MHC Class I Immune Display: Enriching Viral Expression, Virus Vulnerability and Virus Evasion. Many viruses, especially RNA viruses, utilize programmed ribosomal frameshifting and/or stop codon readthrough in their expression, and in the decoding of a few a UGA is dynamically redefined to specify selenocysteine. This recoding can effectively increase viral coding capacity and generate a set ratio of products with the same N-terminal domain(s) but different C-terminal domains. Recoding can also be regulatory or generate a product with the non-universal 21st directly encoded amino acid. Selection for translation speed in the expression of many viruses at the expense of fidelity creates host immune defensive opportunities. In contrast to host opportunism, certain viruses, including some persistent viruses, utilize recoding or adventitious frameshifting as part of their strategy to evade an immune response or specific drugs. Several instances of recoding in small intensively studied viruses escaped detection for many years and their identification resolved dilemmas. The fundamental importance of ribosome ratcheting is consistent with the initial strong view of invariant triplet decoding which however did not foresee the possibility of transitory anticodon:codon dissociation. Deep level dynamics and structural understanding of recoding is underway, and a high level structure relevant to the frameshifting required for expression of the SARS CoV-2 genome has just been determined.

34210892	Ultrapotent antibodies against diverse and highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. The emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) that are resistant to therapeutic antibodies highlights the need for continuing discovery of broadly reactive antibodies. We identify four receptor-binding domain targeting antibodies from three early-outbreak convalescent donors with potent neutralizing activity against 23 variants including the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, B.1.526 and B.1.617 VOCs. Two antibodies are ultrapotent, with sub-nanomolar neutralization titers (IC50 0.3 to 11.1 ng/mL; IC80 1.5 to 34.5 ng/mL). We define the structural and functional determinants of binding for all four VOC-targeting antibodies and show that combinations of two antibodies decrease the in vitro generation of escape mutants, suggesting their potential in mitigating resistance development.

34281623	Reducing the risk of tuberculosis transmission for HCWs in high incidence settings. Globally, tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of hospital-acquired TB infection due to persistent exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in healthcare settings. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed an international system of infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions to interrupt the cycle of nosocomial TB transmission. The guidelines on TB IPC have proposed a comprehensive hierarchy of three core practices, comprising: administrative controls, environmental controls, and personal respiratory protection. However, the implementation of most recommendations goes beyond minimal physical and organisational requirements and thus cannot be appropriately introduced in resource-constrained settings and areas of high TB incidence. In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) the lack of knowledge, expertise and practice on TB IPC is a major barrier to the implementation of essential interventions. HCWs often underestimate the risk of airborne Mtb dissemination during tidal breathing. The lack of required expertise and funding to design, install and maintain the environmental control systems can lead to inadequate dilution of infectious particles in the air, and in turn, increase the risk of TB dissemination. Insufficient supply of particulate respirators and lack of direction on the re-use of respiratory protection is associated with unsafe working practices and increased risk of TB transmission between patients and HCWs. Delayed diagnosis and initiation of treatment are commonly influenced by the effectiveness of healthcare systems to identify TB patients, and the availability of rapid molecular diagnostic tools. Failure to recognise resistance to first-line drugs contributes to the emergence of drug-resistant Mtb strains, including multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Mtb. Future guideline development must consider the social, economic, cultural and climatic conditions to ensure that recommended control measures can be implemented in not only high-income countries, but more importantly low-income, high TB burden settings. Urgent action and more ambitious investments are needed at both regional and national levels to get back on track to reach the global TB targets, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

34287389	Clinical Mortality Review of COVID-19 Patients at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Nepal; A Retrospective Study. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has challenged the health system worldwide, including the low and middle income countries like Nepal. In view of the rising number of infections and prediction of multiple waves of this disease, mortalities due to COVID-19 need to be critically analyzed so that every possible effort could be made to prevent COVID-19 related mortalities in future. Main aim of this research was to study about the mortalities due to COVID-19 at a tertiary level hospital, in Nepal. This was a retrospective, observational study that included all inpatients from Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, who were reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction positive for SARS-COV-2 and died during hospital stay from January 2020 till January 2021. Medical records of the patients were evaluated. Out of 860 total admissions in a year, there were 50 mortalities in the study center. Out of 50 mortalities, majority were males (76%) with male to female ratio of 3.17:1. Most were above 65 years of age (72%) and had two or more comorbidities (64%). The most common comorbidities among the patients who had died during hospital stay were hypertension (58%) followed by diabetes mellitus (50%) and chronic obstructive airway disease (24%). The median duration from the symptom onset to death was 18 days, ranged from the minimum of 2 days till maximum of 39 days. D-dimer was found to be >1 mg/L in 58% cases and ferritin was >500 ng/ml in 42% patients at presentation. A total of 42% patients had thrombocytopenia, 80% patients had lymphocytopenia and 60% had Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio >11.75 with the mean NLR of 18.38. Of total mortalities, 16% patients also showed microbiological evidence of secondary infection; Male gender, age more than 65 years, multiple comorbidities with lymphocytopenia, elevated Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio and elevated inflammatory markers were risk factors found in majority of mortalities in our study. These findings could be utilized for early triage and risk assessment in COVID-19 patients so that aggressive treatment strategies could be employed at the earliest to reduce mortalities due to COVID-19 in future.

34200827	Diagnostic Accuracy of a New Antigen Test for SARS-CoV-2 Detection. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Quick and reliable diagnostic tools play an important role in controlling the spread of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a new cyto-salivary antigen test aimed at detecting the presence of antigens for SARS-CoV-2, as compared by the gold standard RT-PCR and a lateral flow test. METHODS: A total of 433 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study and the sensitivity and specificity of the new cyto-salivary antigen test were calculated, as compared to the RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab and to the lateral flow test. RESULTS: A total of 433 samples were collected and tested at the Mediterranean Fair in Palermo from February 2021 until April 2021. The new cyto-salivary antigen had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94.2%. The sensitivity and the specificity of the lateral flow test were 55% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The new cyto-salivary antigen test detected more positive cases than the RT-PCR in a sample of asymptomatic subjects, demonstrating to be a promising tool for a more sensitive diagnosis of COVID-19. Further studies are warranted to better characterize its diagnostic accuracy.	Diagnosis
34284538	How efficient are facial masks against COVID-19? Evaluating the mask use of various communities one year into the pandemic. Face masks are devices worn over the mouth and nose to protect against splashes, infectious respiratory droplets or aerosols generated during breathing or coughing according to their filtering capacity. Medical masks, respirators or cloth masks have been used for source control and for the protection of the exposed. After the first case on March 11, 2020, in Turkey, National COVID-19 Scientific Advisory Board published various contents for the correct use of masks. Medical face masks have been used in healthcare settings for both source control and potential personal protection before the COVID-19 pandemic. Adverse events associated with using masks are very sparse and mainly associated with tight-fitting respirators or dermatitis due to prolonged use and shouldn?t be a reason for rejection for use. Studies suggest the use of masks mainly in the healthcare facilities but also in the community for source control of people who have respiratory symptoms of communicable diseases other than COVID-19. They are likely to be acceptable if recommended, particularly in more severe epidemics and pandemics. Meta-analysis, case control, cross sectional, cohort, retrospective, retrospective cross sectional, research, randomized controlled and controlled comparison studies were reviewed on the protective effect of masks on COVID-19 with laboratory evidence. Optimum use of face masks with additional precautions found useful controlling the spread of the respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in most of the studies and meta-analyses. As a conclusion, the recent evidence in COVID-19 pandemic is consistent with the previous studies which have shown association between face mask use and decreased risk of viral infections, and medical face mask use should be encouraged both for the community and healthcare facilities along with other infection control measures such as hand hygiene, during outbreaks when there is widespread community transmission.

34336592	Pneumothorax due to COVID-19: Analysis of case reports. Cases of pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum have been reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, the time to onset and hospital stay have rarely been studied. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with these complications are described to determine the time to onset, associated comorbidities, and location and duration of pneumothorax. A search in PubMed yielded simple frequencies and a bivariate analysis of deaths. There were 113 confirmed cases in 67 articles. The median time from the date of hospital admission to the presence of pneumothorax was 8 days. Right hemithorax was the most frequent form of pneumothorax. Almost half of the patients required intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation. Although the frequency of this phenomenon was not high among hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, it was high among those who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study contributes to the literature because it presents a large number of patients who developed pneumothorax after admission, which was characterized by clinical deterioration (dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, and subcutaneous emphysema) and low oxygen saturation levels. Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum is recommended as a differential diagnosis, even without considering the presence of chronic pulmonary comorbidities or invasive mechanical ventilation.	Case Report
34205564	Confounding Factors Influencing the Kinetics and Magnitude of Serological Response Following Administration of BNT162b2. BACKGROUND: Little is known about potential confounding factors influencing the humoral response in individuals having received the BNT162b2 vaccine. METHODS: Blood samples from 231 subjects were collected before and 14, 28, and 42 days following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination with BNT162b2. Anti-spike receptor-binding-domain protein (anti-Spike/RBD) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were measured at each time-point. Impact of age, sex, childbearing age status, hormonal therapy, blood group, body mass index and past-history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were assessed by multivariable analyses. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In naive subjects, the level of anti-Spike/RBD antibodies gradually increased following administration of the first dose to reach the maximal response at day 28 and then plateauing at day 42. In vaccinated subjects with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, the plateau was reached sooner (i.e., at day 14). In the naive population, age had a significant negative impact on anti-Spike/RBD titers at days 14 and 28 while lower levels were observed for males at day 42, when corrected for other confounding factors. Body mass index (BMI) as well as B and AB blood groups had a significant impact in various subgroups on the early response at day 14 but no longer after. No significant confounding factors were highlighted in the previously infected group.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34225749	HLA-dependent heterogeneity and macrophage immunoproteasome activation during lung COVID-19 disease. BACKGROUND: The worldwide pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by significant and unpredictable heterogeneity in symptoms that remains poorly understood. METHODS: Transcriptome and single cell transcriptome of COVID19 lung were integrated with deeplearning analysis of MHC class I immunopeptidome against SARS-COV2 proteome. RESULTS: An analysis of the transcriptomes of lung samples from COVID-19 patients revealed that activation of MHC class I antigen presentation in these tissues was correlated with the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA present. Similarly, a positive relationship was detected in these samples between the level of SARS-CoV-2 and the expression of a genomic cluster located in the 6p21.32 region (40 kb long, inside the MHC-II cluster) that encodes constituents of the immunoproteasome. An analysis of single-cell transcriptomes of bronchoalveolar cells highlighted the activation of the immunoproteasome in CD68 + M1 macrophages of COVID-19 patients in addition to a PSMB8-based trajectory in these cells that featured an activation of defense response during mild cases of the disease, and an impairment of alveolar clearance mechanisms during severe COVID-19. By examining the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 immunopeptidome with the most common HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles worldwide, we found higher numbers of stronger presenters in type A alleles and in Asian populations, which could shed light on why this disease is now less widespread in this part of the world. CONCLUSIONS: HLA-dependent heterogeneity in macrophage immunoproteasome activation during lung COVID-19 disease could have implications for efforts to predict the response to HLA-dependent SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the global population.

34199384	Comparison and Analysis of Neutralizing Antibody Levels in Serum after Inoculating with SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV Vaccines in Humans. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pose a great threat to humanity. Every pandemic involving these coronaviruses has seriously affected human health and economic development. Currently, there are no approved therapeutic drugs against their infections. Therefore, the development of vaccines is particularly important to combat these coronaviruses. In this review, we summarized and analyzed the progress of vaccines against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, including inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, subunit vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines, and viral vector vaccines. In addition, we compared the levels of neutralizing antibodies in the serum of patients with these three kinds of coronaviruses at different stages, and their ability and effects against SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV. This review provides useful information for vaccine evaluation and analysis.	Mechanism;Treatment
34293596	"Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides decrease PD-1 in T cells of healthy subjects and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and increase their proliferation and eradication of HCC cells. T cells of aged people, and of patients with either cancer or severe infections (including COVID-19), are often exhausted, senescent and dysfunctional, leading to increased susceptibilities, complications and mortality. Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides bind their receptors in T cells, and induce multiple beneficial T cell functions. Yet, T cells of different people vary in the expression levels of Neurotransmitter and Neuropeptide receptors, and in the magnitude of the corresponding effects. Therefore, we performed an individual-based study on T cells of 3 healthy subjects, and 3 Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients. HCC usually develops due to chronic inflammation. The inflamed liver induces reduction and inhibition of CD4(+) T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Immune-based therapies for HCC are urgently needed. We tested if selected Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides decrease the key checkpoint protein PD-1 in human T cells, and increase proliferation and killing of HCC cells. First, we confirmed human T cells express all dopamine receptors (DRs), and glutamate receptors (GluRs): AMPA-GluR3, NMDA-R and mGluR. Second, we discovered that either Dopamine, Glutamate, GnRH-II, Neuropeptide Y and/or CGRP (10nM), as well as DR and GluR agonists, induced the following effects: 1. Decreased significantly both %PD-1(+) T cells and PD-1 expression level per cell (up to 60% decrease, within 1 h only); 2. Increased significantly the number of T cells that proliferated in the presence of HCC cells (up to 7 fold increase), 3. Increased significantly T cell killing of HCC cells (up to 2 fold increase). 4. Few non-conventional combinations of Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides had surprising synergistic beneficial effects. We conclude that Dopamine, Glutamate, GnRH-II, Neuropeptide Y and CGRP, alone or in combinations, can decrease % PD-1(+) T cells and PD-1 expression per cell, in T cells of both healthy subjects and HCC patients, and increase their proliferation in response to HCC cells and killing of HCC cells. Yet, testing T cells of many more cancer patients is absolutely needed. Based on these findings and previous ones, we designed a novel ""Personalized Adoptive Neuro-Immunotherapy"", calling for validation of safety and efficacy in clinical trials."	Mechanism;Treatment
34215639	Avascular necrosis as a part of 'long COVID-19'. 'Long COVID-19' can affect different body systems. At present, avascular necrosis (AVN) as a sequalae of 'long COVID-19' has yet not been documented. By large-scale use of life-saving corticosteroids in COVID-19 cases, we anticipate that there will be a resurgence of AVN cases. We report a series of three cases in which patients developed AVN of the femoral head after being treated for COVID-19 infection. The mean dose of prednisolone used in these cases was 758 mg (400-1250 mg), which is less than the mean cumulative dose of around 2000 mg steroid, documented in the literature as causative for AVN. Patients were symptomatic and developed early AVN presentation at a mean of 58 days after COVID-19 diagnosis as compared with the literature which shows that it generally takes 6 months to 1 year to develop AVN post steroid exposure.

34287820	A quantitative evaluation of aerosol generation during supraglottic airway insertion and removal. Many guidelines consider supraglottic airway use to be an aerosol-generating procedure. This status requires increased levels of personal protective equipment, fallow time between cases and results in reduced operating theatre efficiency. Aerosol generation has never been quantitated during supraglottic airway use. To address this evidence gap, we conducted real-time aerosol monitoring (0.3-10-microm diameter) in ultraclean operating theatres during supraglottic airway insertion and removal. This showed very low background particle concentrations (median (IQR [range]) 1.6 (0-3.1 [0-4.0]) particles.l(-1) ) against which the patient's tidal breathing produced a higher concentration of aerosol (4.0 (1.3-11.0 [0-44]) particles.l(-1) , p = 0.048). The average aerosol concentration detected during supraglottic airway insertion (1.3 (1.0-4.2 [0-6.2]) particles.l(-1) , n = 11), and removal (2.1 (0-17.5 [0-26.2]) particles.l(-1) , n = 12) was no different to tidal breathing (p = 0.31 and p = 0.84, respectively). Comparison of supraglottic airway insertion and removal with a volitional cough (104 (66-169 [33-326]), n = 27), demonstrated that supraglottic airway insertion/removal sequences produced <4% of the aerosol compared with a single cough (p < 0.001). A transient aerosol increase was recorded during one complicated supraglottic airway insertion (which initially failed to provide a patent airway). Detailed analysis of this event showed an atypical particle size distribution and we subsequently identified multiple sources of non-respiratory aerosols that may be produced during airway management and can be considered as artefacts. These findings demonstrate supraglottic airway insertion/removal generates no more bio-aerosol than breathing and far less than a cough. This should inform the design of infection prevention strategies for anaesthetists and operating theatre staff caring for patients managed with supraglottic airways.	Prevention
34345351	Telepractice in School-Age Children Who Stutter: A Controlled Before and After Study to Evaluate the Efficacy Of MIDA-SP. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a general reorganization of rehabilitation services in Italy. The lockdown in Italy led to the use of telepractice for the delivery of speech therapy, including stuttering. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Multidimensional, Integrated, Differentiated, Art-Mediated Stuttering Program (MIDA-SP; Tomaiuoli et al., 2012), delivered online for school-age children who stutter. A non-randomized controlled pre- and post-treatment study included an experimental group (11 children) receiving a telepractice adaptation of MIDA-SP and a historical control group (11 children) receiving in-person MIDA-SP. Both groups had been assessed with the Stuttering Severity Instrument - Fourth Edition (SSI-4) and Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering (OASES-S) pre- and post-treatment. No statistically significant differences were found between the two modes of delivery. These findings suggest that MIDA-SP treatment delivered via telepractice is effective for school-age children who stutter.	Prevention
34210694	Giant coronary artery aneurysm as a feature of coronavirus-related inflammatory syndrome. A 5-month-old female infant was admitted to hospital with a history of fever and rash during the recent coronavirus pandemic. She had significantly elevated inflammatory markers and the illness did not respond to first line broad spectrum antibiotics. The illness was later complicated by coronary artery aneurysms which were classified as giant despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids and immunomodulators. The infant had COVID-19 antibodies despite an initial negative COVID-19 PCR test. This case highlights the association of atypical Kawasaki like illness and paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome-temporarily associated with COVID-19 infection.	Case Report
34215614	Digital acoustic surveillance for early detection of respiratory disease outbreaks in Spain: a protocol for an observational study. INTRODUCTION: Cough is a common symptom of COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses. However, objectively measuring its frequency and evolution is hindered by the lack of reliable and scalable monitoring systems. This can be overcome by newly developed artificial intelligence models that exploit the portability of smartphones. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, cough detection for respiratory disease syndromic surveillance represents a simple means for early outbreak detection and disease surveillance. In this protocol, we evaluate the ability of population-based digital cough surveillance to predict the incidence of respiratory diseases at population level in Navarra, Spain, while assessing individual determinants of uptake of these platforms. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants in the Cendea de Cizur, Zizur Mayor or attending the local University of Navarra (Pamplona) will be invited to monitor their night-time cough using the smartphone app Hyfe Cough Tracker. Detected coughs will be aggregated in time and space. Incidence of COVID-19 and other diagnosed respiratory diseases within the participants cohort, and the study area and population will be collected from local health facilities and used to carry out an autoregressive moving average analysis on those independent time series. In a mixed-methods design, we will explore barriers and facilitators of continuous digital cough monitoring by evaluating participation patterns and sociodemographic characteristics. Participants will fill an acceptability questionnaire and a subgroup will participate in focus group discussions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Canada and the Medical Research Ethics Committee of Navarre, Spain. Preliminary findings will be shared with civil and health authorities and reported to individual participants. Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals and international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04762693.	Prevention;Diagnosis
34293316	Covid-19 and Risk of Venous Thromboembolism in Ethnically Diverse Populations. BACKGROUND: Limited existing data suggest the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may increase risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) but information from large, ethnically diverse populations with appropriate controls are lacking. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does the rate of VTE among adults hospitalized with Covid-19 differ from matched hospitalized controls without Covid-19? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study among hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and hospitalized adults without evidence of Covid-19 matched on age, gender, race/ethnicity, acute illness severity, and month of hospitalization between February-August 2020 from two integrated healthcare delivery systems with 36 hospitals. Outcomes included VTE (deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ascertained using diagnosis codes combined with validated natural language processing algorithms applied to electronic health records) and death from any cause at 30 days. Fine and Gray hazards regression was performed to evaluate the association of Covid-19 with VTE after accounting for competing risk of death and residual differences between groups, as well as identifying predictors of VTE in patients with Covid-19. RESULTS: We identified 6,319 adults with Covid-19 and 6,319 matched adults without Covid-19, with mean (SD) age of 60.0 (17.2) years, 46% women, 53.1% Hispanic, 14.6% Asian/Pacific Islander and 10.3% Black. During 30-day follow-up, 313 validated VTE (160 Covid-19, 153 controls) and 1172 deaths (817 Covid-19, 355 controls) occurred. Adults with Covid-19 had a more than threefold adjusted risk of VTE (adjusted hazard ratio 3.48, 95% Confidence Interval 2.03-5.98) compared with matched controls. Predictors of VTE in Covid-19 patients included age >/=55 years, Black race, prior VTE, diagnosed sepsis, prior moderate or severe liver disease, body mass index >/=40 kg/m(2), and platelet count >217 k/mcL. INTERPRETATION: Among ethnically diverse hospitalized adults, Covid-19 infection increased the risk of VTE, and selected patient characteristics were associated with higher thromboembolic risk in the setting of Covid-19.

34211145	Massively scaled-up testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA via next-generation sequencing of pooled and barcoded nasal and saliva samples. Frequent and widespread testing of members of the population who are asymptomatic for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for the mitigation of the transmission of the virus. Despite the recent increases in testing capacity, tests based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays cannot be easily deployed at the scale required for population-wide screening. Here, we show that next-generation sequencing of pooled samples tagged with sample-specific molecular barcodes enables the testing of thousands of nasal or saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a single run without the need for RNA extraction. The assay, which we named SwabSeq, incorporates a synthetic RNA standard that facilitates end-point quantification and the calling of true negatives, and that reduces the requirements for automation, purification and sample-to-sample normalization. We used SwabSeq to perform 80,000 tests, with an analytical sensitivity and specificity comparable to or better than traditional qPCR tests, in less than two months with turnaround times of less than 24 h. SwabSeq could be rapidly adapted for the detection of other pathogens.	Diagnosis
34205036	Impact of the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic on HIV/AIDS Programming in Kenya: Evidence from Kibera Informal Settlement and COVID-19 Hotspot Counties. The study sought to determine the impact of COVID-19 on HIV/AIDS programming in the Kibera informal settlement and COVID-19 hotspot counties during the first wave of the pandemic. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase entailed the analysis of HIV care and treatment secondary data (2018-2020) from the Kenya Health Information System. In the second phase, a prospective cohort study was conducted among people living with HIV in the Kibera informal settlement. A total of 176 participants aged 18 years and above accessing HIV services at selected healthcare facilities in Kibera were randomly sampled from facility electronic medical records and followed up for three months. Socio-demographics and contact details were abstracted from the records and telephone interviews were conducted with consenting participants. Results from the retrospective review of HIV program data indicated a 56% (p < 0.000, 95% CI: 31.3%-62.8%) reduction in uptake of HIV services. Clients starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduced significantly by 48% (p < 0.001, 95% CI: 35.4%-77%) in hotspot counties. However, pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake increased significantly by 24% (p < 0.019, 95% CI: 4%-49%). In Kibera, 14% reported missing medications at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic because of lack of food (38%) and government measures (11%), which affected ART access; 11% did not access health facilities due to fear of contracting COVID-19, government regulations and lack of personal protective equipment. Socioeconomic factors, food insecurity and government measures affected uptake of HIV/AIDS services; hence, the need for scaling up measures to increase access to HIV/AIDS services during the onset of pandemics.

34217425	Acute respiratory distress syndrome. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute respiratory illness characterised by bilateral chest radiographical opacities with severe hypoxaemia due to non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in ARDS and highlighted challenges associated with this syndrome, including its unacceptably high mortality and the lack of effective pharmacotherapy. In this Seminar, we summarise current knowledge regarding ARDS epidemiology and risk factors, differential diagnosis, and evidence-based clinical management of both mechanical ventilation and supportive care, and discuss areas of controversy and ongoing research. Although the Seminar focuses on ARDS due to any cause, we also consider commonalities and distinctions of COVID-19-associated ARDS compared with ARDS from other causes.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34209725	Efficacy of Telemedicine and Telemonitoring in At-Home Monitoring of Patients with COVID-19. AIM: this work aims to assess if telemedicine and telemonitoring are clinically useful and safe for at-home monitoring of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Galicia (Northwestern Spain) between 26 December 2020 and 15 February 2021. The structured, proactive monitoring via telemonitoring (TELEA) of patients considered to be high-risk in the Lugo, A Marina, and Monforte Healthcare Area (ASLAM) was evaluated compared to other models in the remaining healthcare areas of Galicia. RESULTS: Of the 47,053 COVID-19 patients, 4384 (9.3%) were in ASLAM. Of them, 1187 (27.1%) were monitored via TELEA, and the rest (3197 in ASLAM and 42,669 in the rest of Galicia) were monitored via other methods. Patients monitored in ASLAM via TELEA were older, consulted in the emergency department less frequently (p = 0.05), were hospitalized less frequently (p < 0.01), had shorter hospital stays (p < 0.0001), and had a lower mortality rate in their first hospitalization (p = 0.03). No at-home life-threatening emergencies were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: these data suggest that, for COVID-19 patients, a care model involving proactive at-home monitoring with telemedicine and telemonitoring is associated with reduced pressure on hospital services and a lower mortality rate.

34292866	Digital surveillance through an online decision support tool for COVID-19 over one year of pandemic in Italy: an observational study. BACKGROUND: Italy has experienced very severe consequences in terms of hospitalizations and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online decision support systems and self-triage applications have been used in several settings to supplement recommendations from health authorities to prevent and manage COVID-19. A digital Italian health tech startup developed a non-commercial online decision support system to assist individuals in managing their potential exposure to COVID-19 and interpret their symptoms, with a chat user interface, available since the early phases of the pandemic in Italy. OBJECTIVE: To compare the trend of sessions in this online support decision system with that of COVID-19 cases reported by the national health surveillance system in Italy, from February 2020 to March 2021. METHODS: We analyzed the number of sessions by users with a COVID-19 positive contact and by users with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, with the number of cases reported by the National surveillance system. To calculate the distance between the time series, we used the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm. We also applied Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) encoding to the time series in one-week periods and we calculated the Hamming distance between the SAX strings. We shifted time series of sessions from the online decision support system one week ahead and we measured the improvement in Hamming distance to verify the hypothesis that sessions in the online decision support systems anticipate the trends in cases reported to the official surveillance system. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 75,557 sessions in the online decision support system. Among them, 65,207 were sessions by users with symptoms, while 19,062 were by contacts with individuals with COVID-19. The highest number of sessions in the online decision support system was recorded in the early phases of the pandemic. A second peak was observed in October 2020 and a third peak was observed in March 2021, in parallel with the surge of reported cases. Peaks in sessions of the online decision support system preceded the surge of COVID-19 notified cases by approximately one week. The distance between sessions by users with COVID 19 contacts and reported cases calculated by dynamic time warping was 61.23 while the distance with sessions by users with symptoms was 93.72. As the time series of users with a COVID 19 contact was more consistent with the trend of confirmed cases, we applied Symbolic Aggregate approXimation encoding and we measured the Hamming distance between these two time series. After applying a one-week shift, the Hamming distance between the time series of sessions by users with a COVID-19 contact and reported cases improved from 0.49 to 0.46. We repeated the analysis restricting the time window to the time period between July and December 2020. The corresponding Hamming distance was 0.16 before shifting the time series, and improved to 0.08 after the time shift. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal trends in the number of sessions of an online COVID-19 online decision support system may precede the trend of reported COVID-19 cases obtained through traditional surveillance. The trends of sessions by users with a contact with COVID-19 cases may better predict reported cases of COVID-19 than sessions by users with symptoms. Data from online decision support systems may represent a useful information source to supplement traditional surveillance and to support the identification of early warning signals in the COVID-19 pandemic.

34218204	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections in pregnancy - An overview. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections, like most other viruses that affect the respiratory tract can cause severe maternal illness and adverse pregnancy outcomes. They are not only highly transmissible (acquired through droplets), but Host reservoirs such as dromedary camels for MERS-CoV and masked palm civet for SARS-CoV-1 are critical links in the onset of outbreaks. Clinically they present with flu-like symptoms and therefore a high index of suspicion is required to ensure timely diagnosis and tailored management. Although there are not many reported series on these infections in pregnancy they seem to be associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery and maternal mortality. Diagnosis is made by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. There are currently no effective anti-viral agents for these viruses but following infections various agents have been administered to patients. The most important aspect of management should be early identification of deterioration and intensive support and prevention of transmission. Our understanding of the evidence of the impact of both infections on pregnancies suggests the potential for future repeat outbreaks, hence the importance of maintaining vigilance across healthcare systems.

34211811	COVID-19 With an Initial Presentation of Intraperitoneal Hemorrhage Secondary to Spontaneous Splenic Rupture. The WHO declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic in early 2020. As the pandemic has continued to evolve over a period of several months, many cases of unusual presentations are now emerging, which pose a greater challenge for physicians in terms of quickly identifying COVID-19 patients based on initial signs and symptoms. In this report, we present one such unusual presentation in a patient with sudden intraperitoneal hemorrhage and spontaneous splenic rupture with COVID-19 as the likely etiology and contributing factor. The patient was a 75-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of severe left-sided abdominal pain for several days without any preceding trauma. A CT of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a large amount of fluid in the abdomen, which raised suspicion of bleeding. An exploratory laparotomy revealed splenic rupture with hemoperitoneum, and the patient subsequently underwent an emergent splenectomy. The patient's COVID-19 antigen test returned positive during the surgery and was subsequently confirmed with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. COVID-19 has been found to result primarily in respiratory symptoms through its ability to invade endothelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 affinity. It is speculated that this mechanism may cause a predisposition to micro-thromboses, which can eventually lead to manifestations such as large lymphoid organ thrombosis. Based on this case presentation and the evolving literature on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spontaneous splenic rupture is an emergent differential diagnosis that should be considered in COVID-19 patients presenting with gastrointestinal complaints such as abdominal pain and nausea.

34359922	Lock, Stock and Barrel: Role of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System in Coronavirus Disease 2019. Since the end of 2019, the medical-scientific community has been facing a terrible pandemic caused by a new airborne viral agent known as SARS-CoV2. Already in the early stages of the pandemic, following the discovery that the virus uses the ACE2 cell receptor as a molecular target to infect the cells of our body, it was hypothesized that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Since then, numerous studies have been published on the subject, but the exact role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still a matter of debate. RAAS represents an important protagonist in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, providing the virus with the receptor of entry into host cells and determining its organotropism. Furthermore, following infection, the virus is able to cause an increase in plasma ACE2 activity, compromising the normal function of the RAAS. This dysfunction could contribute to the establishment of the thrombo-inflammatory state characteristic of severe forms of COVID-19. Drugs targeting RAAS represent promising therapeutic options for COVID-19 sufferers.	Mechanism;Treatment
34339386	Impact of Recent SARS-CoV-2 Infection on the Course and Severity of Dengue in Children: A Prospective Observational Study from North India. In 2020, a considerable overlap occurred between the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal dengue transmission in India. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of acute or recent infection with SARS-CoV-2 on the course and outcomes of dengue fever in children. We prospectively enrolled 44 children with a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of dengue fever. Assessment of acute and recent SARS-CoV-2 infection was done using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and IgG antibody through ELISA. Children were grouped based on evidence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and clinical severity, and outcomes were compared. The median age of the study cohort was 96 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 69-129 months). Fever (98%), vomiting (78%), abdominal pain (68%), hepatomegaly (68%), and edema (32%) were the common features. About two-thirds (N = 30) had severe dengue; 20 (45%) had dengue shock. Liver dysfunction (58%) and acute kidney injury (25%) were other major organ dysfunctions. Nineteen (43%) children stayed in the pediatric intensive care unit for a median duration of 5 days (IQR: 2-11 days). None had acute SARS-CoV2 infection; however, IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 15 (34%) cases. Children with recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 showed a trend toward a lower incidence of acute kidney injury, fewer organ dysfunctions, and a lower frequency of invasive ventilation. Four children (9%) died; none of the deaths were in the SARS-CoV-2-exposed group. The present study exposes preliminary evidence that dengue fever might follow a less severe course in children with recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is pertinent to understand the antigenic similarity and cross-protective antibody response between the two viruses and their clinical relevance.	Diagnosis
34220348	Population surveillance approach to detect and respond to new clusters of COVID-19. Background: To maintain control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic as lockdowns are lifted, it will be crucial to enhance alternative public health measures. For surveillance, it will be necessary to detect a high proportion of any new cases quickly so that they can be isolated, and people who have been exposed to them traced and quarantined. Here we introduce a mathematical approach that can be used to determine how many samples need to be collected per unit area and unit time to detect new clusters of COVID-19 cases at a stage early enough to control an outbreak. Methods: We present a sample size determination method that uses a relative weighted approach. Given the contribution of COVID-19 test results from sub-populations to detect the disease at a threshold prevalence level to control the outbreak to 1) determine if the expected number of weekly samples provided from current healthcare-based surveillance for respiratory virus infections may provide a sample size that is already adequate to detect new clusters of COVID-19 and, if not, 2) to determine how many additional weekly samples were needed from volunteer sampling. Results: In a demonstration of our method at the weekly and Canadian provincial and territorial (P/T) levels, we found that only the more populous P/T have sufficient testing numbers from healthcare visits for respiratory illness to detect COVID-19 at our target prevalence level-assumed to be high enough to identify and control new clusters. Furthermore, detection of COVID-19 is most efficient (fewer samples required) when surveillance focuses on healthcare symptomatic testing demand. In the volunteer populations: the higher the contact rates; the higher the expected prevalence level; and the fewer the samples were needed to detect COVID-19 at a predetermined threshold level. Conclusion: This study introduces a targeted surveillance strategy, combining both passive and active surveillance samples, to determine how many samples to collect per unit area and unit time to detect new clusters of COVID-19 cases. The goal of this strategy is to allow for early enough detection to control an outbreak.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34215811	Early and long term antibody kinetics of asymptomatic and mild disease COVID-19 patients. Most patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. However, the early and late antibody kinetics, and the association between antibody levels, clinical symptoms, and disease phase in these patients have not yet been fully defined. Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients and their household contacts were evaluated over a period four months. The evaluation procedure included symptom monitoring, viral load and serology analysis every ten days. A total of 1334 serum samples were collected from 135 patients and analyzed using three assays for IgG-N, IgG-S and IgM antibodies. Of the study participants, 97% were seropositive during the study, and two distinct clusters were identified. These clusters were significantly different in their inflammatory related symptoms. Peak IgG-S was 40.0 AU/ml for the non-inflammatory cluster and 71.5 AU/ml for the inflammatory cluster (P = 0.006), whereas IgG-N peaks were 4.3 and 5.87 (P = 0.023) respectively. Finally, a decision tree model was designed to predict the disease phase based on the serological titer levels, and had an overall accuracy of 80.7%. The specific profile of seroconversion and decay of serum antibodies can be used to predict the time-course from the acute infection.	Diagnosis
34205306	Predictors of COVID-19-Related Perceived Improvements in Dietary Health: Results from a US Cross-Sectional Study. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in substantial lifestyle changes. No US study has identified predictors of perceived dietary healthfulness changes during the pandemic period. This study included analyses of lifestyle and dietary healthfulness changes using 958 survey responses from US primary household food purchasers. Information was collected related to demographics, COVID-19-related household changes, and health-related habits before and during the pandemic. Binary logistic regression identified predictors of perceived increase in dietary healthfulness during the pandemic period. Overall, 59.8%, 16.4%, and 23.4% of participants reported that their eating habits likely changed, may have changed, and likely did not change, respectively. Of the participants whose dietary habits likely or may have changed, 64.1%, 16.8%, and 19% reported healthier, neither healthier nor less healthy, and less healthy eating habits, respectively. COVID-19-related income loss, more meals consumed with household members in front of the television, an increase in food advertisement exposure, increased perceived stress, and better perceived current health were significant predictors of a perceived increase in dietary healthfulness. Overall, dietary habits were perceived to become healthier during the pandemic. The predictors of perceived improvement in dietary healthfulness were surprising and indicate the need for further study of these factors in crisis and noncrisis situations.	Prevention
34217662	Prone and Supine 12-Lead ECG Comparisons: Implications for Cardiac Assessment During Prone Ventilation for COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to describe expected changes in a mirror-image prone electrocardiogram (ECG) compared with normal supine, including a range of cardiac conditions. BACKGROUND: Unwell COVID-19 patients are at risk of cardiac complications. Prone ventilation is recommended but poses practical challenges to acquisition of a 12-lead ECG. The effects of prone positioning on the ECG remain unknown. METHODS: 100 patients each underwent 3 ECGs: standard supine front (SF); prone position with precordial leads attached to front (PF); and prone with precordial leads attached to back in a mirror image to front (PB). RESULTS: Prone positioning was associated with QTc prolongation (PF 437 +/- 32 ms vs. SF 432 +/- 31 ms; p < 0.01; PB 436 +/- 34 ms vs. SF 432 +/- 31 ms; p = 0.02). In leads V1 to V3 on PB ECG, a qR morphology was present in 90% and changes in T-wave polarity in 84%. In patients with anterior ischemia, ST-segment changes in V1 to V3 on supine ECG were no longer visible on PB in 100% and replaced by an R wave in V1. Bundle branch block (BBB) remained detectable in 100% on PB, with left BBB appearing as right BBB on PB in 71% and QRS narrowing with qR in V1 for right BBB. ST-segment/T-wave changes in limb leads and arrhythmia detection were largely unaffected in PB. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, the PB ECG is unreliable for the detection of anterior myocardial injury but remains useful for ST-segment/T-wave abnormalities in limb leads, BBB detection, and rhythm monitoring. The prone ECG is a useful screening tool with diagnostic utility in COVID-19 patients who require prone ventilation.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34285000	Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine childhood immunisation in Colombia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine childhood vaccination coverage in Colombia by age group, rural/urban residence, state and vaccine type. DESIGN: Ecological study of official monthly vaccination records. SETTING: Vaccination records from the Colombian Ministry of Health (March-October 2019 and 2020). PARTICIPANTS: Aggregated data for Colombian children (<12 months, n=676 153; 12-23 months, n=700 319; and 5 years, n=734 295) participating in the Expanded Program on Immunization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of eligible population receiving vaccination. RESULTS: Vaccination coverage showed an overall decline of approximately 14.4% from 2019 to 2020 (2019 coverage=76.0, 2020 coverage=61.6%). The greatest reduction in proportion vaccinated was observed in children <12 months of age for pneumococcal vaccine (second dose) (2019 coverage=81.4%; 2020 coverage=62.2%; 2019-2020 absolute difference, 19.2%; 95% CI 14.8% to 23.7%). For children aged 12-23 months, the proportion vaccinated for yellow fever declined by 16.4% (12.4% to 20.9%) from 78.3% in 2019 to 61.8% in 2020. Among children 5 years of age, the biggest decrease occurred for the oral polio vaccine (second dose), with a difference of 11.4% (7.1% to 15.7%) between 2019 and 2020 (73.1% and 61.7% for 2019 and 2020). We observed a statistically significant effect on vaccine coverage in rural versus urban areas for children <12 months and 5 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced uptake of immunisations during the COVID-19 pandemic poses a serious risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks. Colombia and other middle-income countries need to continue to monitor immunisation programme coverage and disease outbreaks at the national and subnational levels and undertake catch-up vaccination activities.

34292921	Factors associated with mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: A prospective cohort in a Peruvian national referral hospital. Objectives: To describe and assess clinical characteristics and factors associated with mortality in adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to a national referral hospital in Peru. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study that included hospitalized patients older than 18 years with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnosis. Patients with a positive rapid serological test on admission but no respiratory symptoms nor compatible images were excluded. We collected the data from clinical records. Results: A total of 813 adults were included, 544 (66.9%) with confirmed COVID-19. The mean age was 61.2 years (standard deviation: 15.0), and 575 (70.5%) were male. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (34.1%) and obesity (25.9%). On admission, the most frequent symptoms were dyspnea (82.2%) and cough (53.9%). A total of 114 (14.0%) patients received mechanical ventilation, 38 (4.7%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 377 (46.4%) died. The requirement for ventilatory support, greater lung involvement, and inflammatory markers were associated with higher mortality. It was found that for every 10-year age increase, the risk of dying increased 32% (relative risk: 1.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.25 to 1.38). Those who were admitted to the intensive care unit and and were placed on mechanical ventilation had 1.39 (95% confidence interval: 1.13 to 1.69) and 1.97 (95% confidence interval: 1.69 to 2.29) times the risk of dying compared to those who did not, respectively. Conclusion: We found a high mortality rate among hospitalized patients associated with older age, higher inflammatory markers, and greater lung involvement.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34214763	Unique autoantibody prevalence in long-term recovered SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. The variability in resolution of SARS-CoV-2-infections between individuals neither is comprehended, nor are the long-term immunological consequences. To assess the long-term impact of a SARS-CoV-2-infection on the immune system, we conducted a prospective study of 80 acute and former SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and 39 unexposed donors to evaluate autoantibody responses and immune composition. Autoantibody levels against cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), a specific predictor for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), were significantly (p = 0.035) elevated in convalescents only, whereas both acute COVID-19 patients and long-term convalescents showed critically increased levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase (TG), a specific predictor of celiac disease (CD) (p = 0.002). Both, anti-CCP and anti-TG antibody levels were still detectable after 4-8 months post infection. Anti-TG antibodies occurred predominantly in aged patients in a context of a post-SARS-CoV-2-specific immune composition (R(2) = 0.31; p = 0.044). This study shows that increased anti-CCP and anti-TG autoantibody levels can remain long-term after recovering even from mildly experienced COVID-19. The inter-relationship of the lung as viral entry side and RA- and CD-associated autoimmunity indicates that a SARS-CoV-2-infection could be a relevant environmental factor in their pathogenesis.

34133077	Long-lived macrophage reprogramming drives spike protein-mediated inflammasome activation in COVID-19. Innate immunity triggers responsible for viral control or hyperinflammation in COVID-19 are largely unknown. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein) primes inflammasome formation and release of mature interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in macrophages derived from COVID-19 patients but not in macrophages from healthy SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses reveal robust S-protein-driven inflammasome activation in macrophages isolated from convalescent COVID-19 patients, which correlates with distinct epigenetic and gene expression signatures suggesting innate immune memory after recovery from COVID-19. Importantly, we show that S-protein-driven IL-1beta secretion from patient-derived macrophages requires non-specific monocyte pre-activation in vivo to trigger NLRP3-inflammasome signaling. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes profound and long-lived reprogramming of macrophages resulting in augmented immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, a major vaccine antigen and potent driver of adaptive and innate immune signaling.

34209991	Facial Self-Touching and the Propagation of COVID-19: The Role of Gloves in the Dental Practice. BACKGROUND: Despite facial self-touching being a possible source of transmission of SARS-Co-V-2 its role in dental practice has not been studied. Factors such as anxiety symptoms or threat perception of COVID-19 may increase the possibility of contagion. The objective was to compare the impact of control measures, such as gloves or signs in the reduction in facial self-touching. METHODS: An intra-subject design was undertaken with 150 adults. The patients' movements in the waiting room were monitored with Microsoft Kinect software on three occasions: without any control measures, using plastic gloves or using advisory signs against self-touching. Additionally, the participants completed the sub-scale of STAI (State-Anxiety) and the BIP-Q5 (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire); their blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. RESULTS: The lowest incidence of facial self-touching occurred in the experimental situation in which gloves were introduced. The subjects with elevated anxiety symptoms realized more facial self-touching regardless of the control measures. However, the threat perception of COVID-19 is associated negatively with facial self-touching. CONCLUSIONS: The use of gloves is a useful control measure in the reduction in facial touching. However, people with anxiety symptoms regardless of whether they have greater threat perception for COVID-19 exhibit more facial touching.	Prevention
34202613	The Role of Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Review. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), discovered in 2019, is responsible for the global coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The main protein that interacts with the host cell receptor is the Spike-1 (S1) subunit of the coronavirus. This subunit binds with receptors present on the host cell membrane. It has been identified from several studies that neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is one of the co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the significance of NRP-1 in SARS-CoV-2 infection. MEDLINE/PubMed database was used for a search of available literature. In the current review, we report that NRP-1 plays many important functions, including angiogenesis, neuronal development, and the regulation of immune responses. Additionally, the presence of this glycoprotein on the host cell membrane significantly augments the infection and spread of SARS-CoV-2. Literature data suggest that NRP-1 facilitates entry of the virus into the central nervous system through the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. Moreover, published findings show that interfering with VEGF-A/NRP-1 using NRP-1 inhibitors may produce an analgesic effect. The review describes an association between NRP-1, SARS-CoV-2 and, inter alia, pathological changes in the retina. Based on the published findings, we suggest that NRP-1 is a very important mediator implicated in, inter alia, neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, it appears that the use of NRP-1 inhibitors is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Mechanism;Treatment
34291681	Antibiotic Use and Associated Risk Factors for Antibiotic Prescribing in COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients. BACKGROUND: Literature suggests that antibiotic prescribing in COVID-19 patients is high. Currently, there are insufficient data on what drives antibiotic prescribing practices throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine antibiotic use rates and identify risk factors for antibiotic prescribing in hospitalized patients. It was the first study to assess risk factors for receiving more than 1 course of antibiotics. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multi-center, observational study. Patients admitted from March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020, and treated for COVID-19 were included. The primary endpoint was the rate of antibiotic use during hospitalization. Secondary endpoints included risk factors associated with antibiotic use, risk factors associated with receiving more than 1 antibiotic course, and rate of microbiologically confirmed infections. RESULTS: A total of 208 encounters (198 patients) were included in the final analysis. Eighty-three percent of patients received at least 1 course of antibiotics, despite low rates of microbiologically confirmed infection (12%). Almost one-third of patients (30%) received more than 1 course of antibiotics. Risk factors identified for both antibiotic prescribing and receiving more than 1 course of antibiotics included increased hospital length of stay (median 12 days), intensive care unit admission, and the necessity for mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: There were high rates of antibiotic prescribing with low rates of microbiologically confirmed bacterial co-infection. Many patients received more than 1 course of antibiotics during hospitalization. This study highlights the importance and demand for appropriate antibiotic stewardship practices in COVID-19 patients.

34203409	The Potential Use of Vitamin C to Prevent Kidney Injury in Patients with COVID-19. The newly found SARS-CoV-2 has led to the pandemic of COVID-19, which has caused respiratory distress syndrome and even death worldwide. This has become a global public health crisis. Unfortunately, elders and subjects with comorbidities have high mortality rates. One main feature of COVID-19 is the cytokine storm, which can cause damage in cells and tissues including the kidneys. Here, we reviewed the current literature on renal impairments in patients with COVID-19 and analyzed the possible etiology and mechanisms. In addition, we investigated the potential use of vitamin C for the prevention of renal injury in those patients. It appears that vitamin C could be helpful to improve the outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Lastly, we discussed the possible protective effects of vitamin C on renal functions in COVID-19 patients with existing kidney conditions.	Treatment
34218318	COVID-19 in pediatric patients undergoing chronic dialysis and kidney transplantation. The study aims to present the incidence of COVID-19 in pediatric patients undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT) and to compare the severity and outcomes of the disease between the dialysis and kidney transplant (KTx) groups. This multicenter observational study was conducted between 1 April and 31 December 2020 in Istanbul. Members of the Istanbul branch of the Turkish Pediatric Nephrology Association were asked to report all confirmed cases of COVID-19 who were on RRT, as well as the number of prevalent RRT patients under the age of 20. A total of 46 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported from 12 centers, of which 17 were dialysis patients, and 29 were KTx recipients. Thus, the incidence rate of COVID-19 was 9.3% among dialysis patients and 9.2% among KTx recipients over a 9-month period in Istanbul. Twelve KTx recipients and three dialysis patients were asymptomatic (p = 0.12). Most of the symptomatic patients in both the dialysis and KTx groups had a mild respiratory illness. Only two patients, one in each group, experienced a severe disease course, and only one hemodialysis patient had a critical illness that required mechanical ventilation. In the entire cohort, one hemodialysis patient with multiple comorbidities died.Conclusion: While most cases are asymptomatic or have a mild disease course, pediatric patients undergoing dialysis and a kidney transplant are at increased risk for COVID-19. What is Known: * In adult population, both dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk for severe illness of COVID-19 and have higher mortality rate. * Children with kidney transplantation are not at increased risk for COVID-19 and most have mild disease course. * Data on children on dialysis are scarce. What is New: * Pediatric patients undergoing dialysis and kidney transplantation have an increased risk for COVID-19. * Most patients undergoing renal replacement therapy either on dialysis or transplanted develop asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 disease with a favorable outcome.

34228867	Prognostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an accessible and widely used biomarker. NLR may be used as an early marker of poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic value of the NLR in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Observational studies that reported the association between baseline NLR values (ie, at hospital admission) and severity or all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Random effects models and inverse variance method were used for meta-analyses. The effects were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Small study effects were assessed with the Egger's test. RESULTS: We analysed 61 studies (n = 15 522 patients), 58 cohorts, and 3 case-control studies. An increase of one unit of NLR was associated with higher odds of severity (OR 6.22; 95%CI 4.93 to 7.84; P < .001) and higher odds of all-cause mortality (OR 12.6; 95%CI 6.88 to 23.06; P < .001). In our sensitivity analysis, we found that 41 studies with low risk of bias and moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 53% and 58%) maintained strong association between NLR values and both outcomes (severity: OR 5.36; 95% CI 4.45 to 6.45; P < .001; mortality: OR 10.42 95% CI 7.73 to 14.06; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: Higher values of NLR were associated with severity and all-cause mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34203982	Severe COVID-19 in Hospitalized Carriers of Single CFTR Pathogenic Variants. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is extremely heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severely ill patients. Thus, host genetic factors may be involved in determining disease presentation and progression. Given that carriers of single cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing variants of the CFTR gene-CF-carriers-are more susceptible to respiratory tract infections, our aim was to determine their likelihood of undergoing severe COVID-19. We implemented a cohort study of 874 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19, during the first pandemic wave in Italy. Whole exome sequencing was performed and validated CF-causing variants were identified. Forty subjects (16 females and 24 males) were found to be CF-carriers. Among mechanically ventilated patients, CF-carriers were more represented (8.7%) and they were significantly (p < 0.05) younger (mean age 51 years) compared to noncarriers (mean age 61.42 years). Furthermore, in the whole cohort, the age of male CF-carriers was lower, compared to noncarriers (p < 0.05). CF-carriers had a relative risk of presenting an abnormal inflammatory response (CRP >/= 20 mg/dL) of 1.69 (p < 0.05) and their hazard ratio of death at day 14 was 3.10 (p < 0.05) in a multivariate regression model, adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities. In conclusion, CF-carriers are more susceptible to the severe form of COVID-19, showing also higher risk of 14-day death.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34229329	Brief Report: Acute Kidney Injury in People Living With HIV Hospitalized With Coronavirus Disease 2019: Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes. BACKGROUND: Data on clinical characteristics and outcomes of people living with HIV (PLWH) hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) are limited. SETTING: Large tertiary health care system in the Bronx, NY. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 83 PLWH and 4151 patients without HIV hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 10, 2020, to May 11, 2020. We compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with AKI by HIV serostatus and evaluated HIV-related factors for AKI among PLWH. AKI was defined and staged using Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. RESULTS: The incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly by HIV serostatus (54.2% in PLWH vs 49.5% in patients without HIV, P = 0.6). Despite a higher incidence of stage 3 AKI (28.9% vs 17.1% P = 0.05) in PLWH compared with those without HIV, there was no significant difference in the need for renal replacement therapy (22.2% vs 13.4% P = 0.12), renal recovery (76.9% vs 82.5% P = 0.61), or dependence on renal replacement therapy (7.7% vs 3.8% P = 0.27). CD4 T-cell count, HIV-1 RNA viral suppression, and antiretroviral therapy use were not associated with AKI. AKI was associated with increased need for invasive ventilation and in-hospital death, but HIV was not an independent risk factor of in-hospital death after AKI [adjusted hazard ratio 1.01 (95% CI: 0.59 to 1.72), P = 0.98]. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-related factors were not associated with increased risk of AKI in PLWH hospitalized with COVID-19. PLWH hospitalized with COVID-19 had more stage 3 AKI, but outcomes after AKI were similar to those without HIV.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34202867	Characteristics of Healthcare Workers Vaccinated against Influenza in the Era of COVID-19. Understanding the potential impact of COVID-19 on receiving influenza vaccination among healthcare workers (HCWs) is of utmost importance. The purposes of the present cross-sectional study were to describe the characteristics and to explore the predictors of receiving influenza vaccination among a large cohort of Italian HCWs in hospital settings. Information was collected through an anonymous questionnaire from December 2020 through January 2021. General and practice characteristics, perceived risk of seasonal influenza, attitudes towards efficacy and safety of influenza vaccination, and reasons behind the decision to be vaccinated against influenza were explored. Fewer than half (46.2%) of HCWs agreed that influenza is a serious illness and perceived the risk of getting infected with influenza, and concerns about the safety of the vaccination were significant positive predictors. Fewer than half of the respondents were not concerned at all about the efficacy (48.6%) and safety (49.8%) of influenza vaccination, and 51.9% reported that they have not received a seasonal influenza vaccine during the previous season. The most mentioned reason for receiving the influenza vaccine in the current season was that influenza and COVID-19 share some similar symptoms. Study results will aid policymakers in developing vaccination education programs, promotion of trust to address negative misconceptions, and to achieve future high coverage among this high-risk group.

Summary. Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) includes the subacute, symptomatic phase 4-12 weeks after acute COVID-19 as well as the subsequent chronic post-COVID-19 period. PACS is associated with various general symptoms and organ (pulmonary, cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, endocrine, musculoskeletal, dermatological, renal) manifestations. In this summary, we review the pathogenetic and risk factors leading to the development of PACS. We present the clinical picture and diagnostics. PACS should usually be managed by the general practitioner. The management of PACS includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment, multidisciplinary rehabilitation and regular follow-ups. Here we also discuss the tasks of the general practitioner, the reasons for referral to specialists and the need to set up and operate a post-COVID-19 network. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(27): 1067-1078.

34363257	Herpes zoster after inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in two healthy young adults. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause various cutaneous manifestations that were identified since the outbreak.(1) With the era of vaccination, cutaneous side effects of vaccines will likely be frequently encountered. Mild reactions like localized redness and swelling have been detected in vaccines reaching phase 3 trials; besides, rarer adverse effects such as injection cite urticaria, maculo-papular rash, reaction to dermal fillers due to COVID-19 vaccines have been reported.(2).

34217422	"Understanding COVID-19 impact on cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screening among federally qualified healthcare centers participating in ""Back on track with screening"" quality improvement projects. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to decreases in breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screenings between 86 and 94% compared to three-year averages. These postponed screenings have created backlogs that systems will need to address as healthcare facilities re-open for preventive care. The American Cancer Society is leading a 17-month intervention with 22 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) across the United States aimed at reducing cancer incidence and mortality disparities and alleviating additional strain caused by COVID-19. This study describes COVID-related cancer screening service disruptions reported by participating FQHCs. Selected FQHCs experienced service disruptions and/or preventive care cancellations due to COVID-19 that varied in severity and duration. Fifty-nine percent stopped cancer screenings completely. Centers transitioned to telehealth visits or rescheduled for the future, but the impact of these strategies may be limited by continued pandemic-related disruptions and the inability to do most screenings at home; colon cancer screening being the exception. Most centers have resumed in-person screening, but limited in person appointments and high levels of community transmission may reduce FQHC abilities to provide catch-up services. FQHCs provide critical cancer prevention services to vulnerable populations. The delivery of culturally competent, high-quality healthcare can mitigate and potentially reverse racial and ethnic disparities in cancer prevention testing and treatment. Ensuring and expanding access to care as we move out of the pandemic will be critical to preventing excess cancer incidence and mortality in vulnerable populations."	Prevention
34214571	Performance of the Roche IL-6 chemiluminescent immunoassay in patients with COVID-like respiratory symptoms. INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the Roche Elecsys IL6 assay on the Cobas immunoassay analyser. METHOD: Serum IL6 of 144 controls were compared to 52 samples from patients with COVID-like respiratory symptoms (17 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive); 25 of these were from the intensive care unit (ICU). We compared the IL6 levels to C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels in all cases. RESULTS: The IL6 assay had coefficient-of-variation (CV) of 2.3 % (34.1 pg/mL) and 2.5 % (222.5 pg/mL), a limit of quantitation <1.6 pg/mL, and was linear from 1.6 to 4948 pg/mL. There was a significant difference in IL6 values between patients with COVID-like respiratory symptoms versus controls (p < 0.001). ROC analysis showed that IL6 > 6.4 pg/mL identified symptomatic cases (AUC 0.94, sensitivity 88.2 %, specificity 97.2 %). There was a significant difference between the IL6 of symptomatic ICU/non-ICU cases (median IL6 228 vs 11 pg/mL, p < 0.0001); ROC analysis showed IL6 > 75 pg/mL (sensitivity 76.0 %, specificity 88.9 %) was superior to CRP and PCT in predicting ICU admission (AUC: IL6 0.83, CRP 0.71, PCT 0.82). CONCLUSION: The performance of Elecsys IL6 assay is in keeping with the manufacturer's claims. IL6 > 6.4 pg/mL differentiates healthy from suspected COVID-19 cases and appears to be raised earlier than the other inflammatory markers in some cases. IL6 > 75 pg/mL was a good predictor of ICU admission.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34290078	Combined non-invasive respiratory support therapies to treat SARS-CoV-2 patients: A prospective Observational Study. Background: The role of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and CPAP in COVID-19 are controversial. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of the application of a non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) algorithm on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 subjects with acute respiratory failure (ARF).Methods: We performed a single center prospective observational study of subjects with respiratory failure from COVID-19 managed with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and CPAP+HFNC (combined therapy). The main outcome was the intubation rate, which defined failure of therapy. We also analyzed the role of the ROX index ([SpO2/FiO2]/respiratory rate) to predict the need for intubation.Results: From June to December 2020, 113 subjects with COVID-19 respiratory failure were admitted to our respiratory intermediate care unit (RICU). HFNC was applied in 65 subjects (57.52%) and combined therapy in 48 (42.47%). A total of 83 subjects (73.45%) were successfully treated with NIRS. The intubation rate was 26.54 %, and overall mortality was 14.15%. Mortality rate in intubated subjects was 55.2%. ROX index of 6.28 at 12 hours predicted NIRS failure, with 97.6% of sensitivity and 51.8% of specificity.Conclusions: Data from our cohort managed on RICU showed that combined NIRS are feasible with favorable outcomes. Further prospective studies are required.	Treatment
34281096	A Possible Preventive Role of Physically Active Lifestyle during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic; Might Regular Cold-Water Swimming and Exercise Reduce the Symptom Severity of COVID-19? The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence and course of COVID-19 and the risk of an upper respiratory tract infection in a group of people with physically active lifestyles. Data were collected anonymously using an online survey platform during December 2020. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 65 years. Out of 2343 participants, 11.5% overcame COVID-19 infection. Relative to the control group (CTRL), physically active, cold-water swimmers (PACW) did not exhibit a lower risk of incidence for COVID-19 (RR 1.074, CI 95% (0.710-1.625). However, PACW had a higher chance of having an asymptomatic course of COVID-19 (RR 2.321, CI 95% (0.836-6.442); p < 0.05) and a higher chance of only having an acute respiratory infection once or less per year than CTRL (RR 1.923, CI 95% (1.1641-2.253); p < 0.01). Furthermore, PACW exhibited a lower incidence of acute respiratory infection occurring more than twice per year (RR 0.258, CI 95% (0.138-0.483); p < 0.01). Cold-water swimming and physical activity may not lessen the risk of COVID-19 in recreational athletes. However, a physically active lifestyle might have a positive effect on the rate of incidence of acute respiratory infection and on the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.	Prevention
34376168	Transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a mid-size city of China. BACKGROUND: An outbreak of pneumonia, COVID-19 associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and then rapidly spread to other cities. Wenzhou is located approximately 900 km from Wuhan, which was experiencing an outbreak that was severe at the time but is considered modest as the epidemic became a pandemic. We described the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 outside of the epicenter to help understand the transmission pattern in a mid-sized Chinese city. METHODS: To investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19, we described case series of 473 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wenzhou, China from January 27 to March 16, 2020. We described the public health interventions of COVID-19 and evaluated the effect of interventions by the effective reproduction number (Rt). RESULTS: The median age of all patients was 47.6 years, 48.4% of whom were female. 33.8% of the patients had a history of residence in Wuhan. Fever (71.7%) and cough (43.1%) were the most common symptoms. In addition, three kinds of unconventional cases were observed, namely 4.9% asymptomatic patients, 7.6% confirmed patients who had no link to Wuhan city but contact with individuals from Wuhan without any symptoms at the time of contact, and 12.9% confirmed patients who had an unknown source of transmission. We estimated that the basic reproductive number (R0) was 2.75 (95% CI: 2.37-3.23). The Rt fluctuated within the range of 2.50 to 3.74 from January 11 to January 16 while gradually reached a peak of 3.74 on January 16. Rt gradually decreased after January 16 and decreased to 1.00 on January 30. Rt continually decreased and reached the lowest point (0.03) on February 21, 2020. CONCLUSION: Our study presented the possibility of asymptomatic carriers affected with SARS-CoV-2, and transmission by these three kinds of unconventional patients in Wenzhou may be an important characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The evaluation showed that a series of multifaceted interventions proved effective in controlling the epidemic of COVID-19. These findings might provide valuable examples of control policies for countries or areas in combatting the global pandemic of COVID-19.	Transmission;Prevention
34291081	In silico Screening of Natural Phytocompounds Towards Identification of Potential Lead Compounds to Treat COVID-19. COVID-19 is one of the members of the coronavirus family that can easily assail humans. As of now, 10 million people are infected and above two million people have died from COVID-19 globally. Over the past year, several researchers have made essential advances in discovering potential drugs. Up to now, no efficient drugs are available on the market. The present study aims to identify the potent phytocompounds from different medicinal plants (Zingiber officinale, Cuminum cyminum, Piper nigrum, Curcuma longa, and Allium sativum). In total, 227 phytocompounds were identified and screened against the proteins S-ACE2 and M (pro) through structure-based virtual screening approaches. Based on the binding affinity score, 30 active phytocompounds were selected. Amongst, the binding affinity for beta-sitosterol and beta-elemene against S-ACE2 showed -12.0 and -10.9 kcal/mol, respectively. Meanwhile, the binding affinity for beta-sitosterol and beta-chlorogenin against M (pro) was found to be -9.7 and -8.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Further, the selected compounds proceeded with molecular dynamics simulation, prime MM-GBSA analysis, and ADME/T property checks to understand the stability, interaction, conformational changes, binding free energy, and pharmaceutical relevant parameters. Moreover, the hotspot residues such as Lys31 and Lys353 for S-ACE2 and catalytic dyad His41 and Cys145 for M (pro) were actively involved in the inhibition of viral entry. From the in silico analyses, we anticipate that this work could be valuable to ongoing novel drug discovery with potential treatment for COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34379308	In-depth profiling of COVID-19 risk factors and preventive measures in healthcare workers. PURPOSE: To determine risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthcare workers (HCWs), characterize symptoms, and evaluate preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 spread in hospitals. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study conducted between May 27 and August 12, 2020, after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, we obtained serological, epidemiological, occupational as well as COVID-19-related data at a quaternary care, multicenter hospital in Munich, Germany. RESULTS: 7554 HCWs participated, 2.2% of whom tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Multivariate analysis revealed increased COVID-19 risk for nurses (3.1% seropositivity, 95% CI 2.5-3.9%, p = 0.012), staff working on COVID-19 units (4.6% seropositivity, 95% CI 3.2-6.5%, p = 0.032), males (2.4% seropositivity, 95% CI 1.8-3.2%, p = 0.019), and HCWs reporting high-risk exposures to infected patients (5.5% seropositivity, 95% CI 4.0-7.5%, p = 0.0022) or outside of work (12.0% seropositivity, 95% CI 8.0-17.4%, p < 0.0001). Smoking was a protective factor (1.1% seropositivity, 95% CI 0.7-1.8% p = 0.00018) and the symptom taste disorder was strongly associated with COVID-19 (29.8% seropositivity, 95% CI 24.3-35.8%, p < 0.0001). An unbiased decision tree identified subgroups with different risk profiles. Working from home as a preventive measure did not protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. A PCR-testing strategy focused on symptoms and high-risk exposures detected all larger COVID-19 outbreaks. CONCLUSION: Awareness of the identified COVID-19 risk factors and successful surveillance strategies are key to protecting HCWs against SARS-CoV-2, especially in settings with limited vaccination capacities or reduced vaccine efficacy.

34289965	Head home: implementation during COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that between 20% and 50% of paediatric head injuries attending our emergency department (ED) could be safely discharged soon after triage, without the need for medical review, using a 'Head Injury Discharge At Triage' tool (HIDAT). We sought to implement this into clinical practice. METHODS: Paediatric ED triage staff underwent competency-based assessments for HIDAT with all head injury presentations 1 May to 31 October 2020 included in analysis. We determined which patients were discharged using the tool, which underwent CT of the brain and whether there was a clinically important traumatic brain injury or representation to the ED. RESULTS: Of the 1429 patients screened; 610 (43%) screened negative with 250 (18%) discharged by nursing staff. Of the entire cohort, 32 CTs were performed for head injury concerns (6 abnormal) with 1 CT performed in the HIDAT negative group (normal). Of those discharged using HIDAT, four reattended, two with vomiting (no imaging or admission) and two with minor scalp wound infections. Two patients who screened negative declined discharge under the policy with later medical discharge (no imaging or admission). Paediatric ED attendances were 29% lower than in 2018. CONCLUSION: We have successfully implemented HIDAT into local clinical practice. The number discharged (18%) is lower than originally described; this is likely multifactorial. The relationship between COVID-19 and paediatric ED attendances is unclear but decreased attendances suggest those for whom the tool was originally designed are not attending ED and may be accessing other medical/non-medical resources.

34222798	Parenteral Anticoagulation and Retroperitoneal Hemorrhage in COVID-19: Case Report of Five Patients. Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a hypercoagulable state, especially in critical patients, anticoagulation is used for thromboprophylaxis. Hemorrhagic complications, even uncommon ones such as retroperitoneal hemorrhage, can occur following anticoagulant administration. We present 5 patients with COVID-19 whose clinical course was complicated by spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage. The patients were initially presented with respiratory manifestations of the infection. There was no history or evidence suggestive for traumatic injury. After hospitalization, the patients received supplemental oxygen, antibiotics, enoxaparin or heparin, interferon beta-1b (in three patients), and anticoagulation with subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin (three patients) or heparin (two patients). During the course of hospitalization, the patients showed sudden-onset abdominal pain (three cases), hypotension (three cases), and an acute drop in hemoglobin level. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed retroperitoneal hemorrhage. For one patient, owing to unstable vital signs and an expanding hematoma, surgical intervention was performed. Others were managed conservatively with discontinuation of anticoagulants, intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation, and packed red blood cells transfusion. Three patients died due to worsening of the infection and respiratory failure. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage could be a potential complication in COVID-19 patients receiving anticoagulation. Careful monitoring of the vital signs and blood tests like hemoglobin level of such patients is essential.	Case Report
34346995	[The epidemics in La Pampa (Argentina), from a historical perspective]. This article describes the emergence of health concerns relating to the epidemics that occurred during the twentieth century in La Pampa, a province in Argentina. Epidemics such as smallpox drove such policies, which frequently originated in Buenos Aires, the country's capital. The spread of many epidemics was due to shortages: water, sewage and adequate refuse disposal, an insufficient number of health care workers, the presence of disease transmission vectors such as mosquitos, and, ultimately, poverty. The historical experience described in this text highlights the importance of analyzing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 beyond the big cities.	Prevention
34215666	Antibody Status, Disease History, and Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Patients on Chronic Dialysis. BACKGROUND: Although reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rare among individuals with few coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk factors, the ability of naturally acquired immunity to prevent reinfection among patients with ESKD is not known. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted among adults with ESKD treated with in-center hemodialysis (ICHD) in the United States. Exposure was ascribed on the basis of the presence or absence of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, and separately, a history of documented COVID-19 before study entry. Outcomes were assessed after an infection-free period, and were any SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., detected by protocolized PCR tests or during routine clinical surveillance), and clinically manifest COVID-19 (consisting of only the latter). RESULTS: Of 2337 consented participants who met study inclusion criteria, 9.5% were anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive at baseline; 3.6% had a history of COVID-19. Over 6679 patient-months of follow-up, 263 participants had evidence of any SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 141 who had clinically manifest COVID-19. Presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (versus its absence) at baseline was associated with lower risk of any SARS-CoV-2 infection (incidence rate ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.95) and clinically manifest COVID-19 0.21 (95% confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.67). CONCLUSION: Among patients with ESKD, naturally acquired anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity is associated with a 45% lower risk of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a 79% lower risk of clinically manifest COVID-19. Because natural immunity is incomplete, patients with ESKD should be prioritized for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, independent of their COVID-19 disease history.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34290398	Dendritic cell deficiencies persist seven months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infection induces an exacerbated inflammation driven by innate immunity components. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the defense against viral infections, for instance plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), have the capacity to produce vast amounts of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). In COVID-19 there is a deficit in DC numbers and IFN-alpha production, which has been associated with disease severity. In this work, we described that in addition to the DC deficiency, several DC activation and homing markers were altered in acute COVID-19 patients, which were associated with multiple inflammatory markers. Remarkably, previously hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients remained with decreased numbers of CD1c+ myeloid DCs and pDCs seven months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the expression of DC markers such as CD86 and CD4 were only restored in previously nonhospitalized patients, while no restoration of integrin beta7 and indoleamine 2,3-dyoxigenase (IDO) levels were observed. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the immunological sequelae of COVID-19.	Mechanism
34337912	Comparison of renal replacement therapy and renal recovery before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A single centre observational study. BACKGROUND: Our objective was to the describe indications, management, complications and outcomes of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in COVID-19 critically ill patients. To contextualise these findings, comparisons were made against 36 non-COVID-19 consecutive patients requiring RRT on ICU. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single centre observational cohort study of patients requiring acute RRT between 1st March and 30th June 2020. Comparison was made against those receiving RRT in the pre-COVID-19 period from January 2019 to February 2020. RESULTS: Of 154 COVID-19 patients, 47 (30.5%) received continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVHF), all of whom required mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. The requirement for RRT was related to fluid balance rather than azotaemia. Compared to 36 non-COVID-19 patients, those with COVID-19 were younger (p=0.016) with a lower serum creatinine on hospital admission (p=0.049), and lesser degrees of metabolic acidosis (p<0.001) and lactataemia (p<0.001) before initiation of RRT. In addition, the duration of RRT requirement was longer (p<0.001). Despite lower CVVHF exchange rates with higher serum creatinine levels following RRT initiation in the COVID-19 patients, metabolic abnormalities were corrected. Hospital mortality was 60% among COVID-19 patients requiring RRT, compared to 67% in non-COVID patients (p=0.508), and renal recovery among survivors without pre-existing CKD was similar (p=0.231). CONCLUSIONS: The requirement for RRT in COVID-19 patients was primarily related to fluid balance and using lower CVVHF exchange rates was effective to correct metabolic abnormalities. Renal recovery occurred in all but one patient by 60 days in the 40% of patients who survived.	Diagnosis;Treatment

Although many reports of neurological complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection exist, none of them are of patients on hemodialysis, who have a fivefold greater risk of stroke than the general population. In this report, we emphasize the importance of being vigilant for mild stroke in high risk populations-such as patients on hemodialysis-with COVID-19, since these conditions have overlapping symptoms.

34351091	Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination promises to improve the catastrophic prognosis of hemodialysis patients as a result of COVID-19. The COViNEPH Project. Introduction There is an urgent need to check the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among hemodialyzed (HD) patients known to have extensive disturbances of acquired immunity and a catastrophic risk of death from COVID-19. Objectives In a cross-sectional study we aimed to assess the humoral response following vaccination with the BNT162b2 (BioNTech / Pfizer Comirnaty) vaccine. Patients and methods We analyzed the titer magnitude of the IgG antibodies directed against spike (S)- SARS-CoV-2 antigen 14-21 days after the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine in a group of HD patients who have not been confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection yet, compared to patients with a history of COVID-19. 126 HD patients were stratified based on evidence of a previous infection with SARS-COV-2 confirmed with viral RNA detection or nucleocapsid-specific IgG antibodies detection. Results s-antigen immune response with a median (IQR) antibody titer of 366 (193-691) UA/ml was seen in 87 of 91 infection naive (IN)-HD patients (95.6%). In 68 of 91 IN-HD patients (74.7%) a strong humoral response was observed with titer anti-S antibodies above 200 UA/ml. Older subjects were less likely to develop an S-antibodies response (P <0.001). The median S-antigen antibody titer in 35 previously infected (PI)-HD patients was over 12-fold higher than in IN-HD patients; 4620 (1240-7820) UA/ml (P <0.001). There were no significant differences in S-antibody titer between symptomatic and asymptomatic PI-HD patients. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that the majority of HD patients achieved a high immunization rate after vaccination with BNT162b2. Whether this translates into protecting this population from COVID-19 requires further research.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34221848	Perception and experiences regarding COVID-19 pandemic among urban young adults in Bangladesh: a mixed-method study. Aim: This study aimed at exploring the perception and experiences with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi urban young adults. Subject and methods: Using a mixed-method approach, an online cross-sectional survey among 315 participants and in-depth interviews (IDI) among 20 young adults were conducted from May 1 to May 25, 2020. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were performed for quantitative data, along with the thematic analysis for qualitative data. Results: The mean (+/- SD) age of the participants was 26.54 (+/- 3.05), and the majority were male (54.9%). About 81.6% of the participants reported COVID-19 as a viral disease, transmitted through droplets of sneezing and coughing, and close contact with another person (90.8%). Nearly 40% of participants reported news channels as a reliable source of information for COVID-19. Participants who were male were less likely to be aware than females in terms of mode of transmission of COVID-19 such as going outside of the home (82.7% male vs 90.8% female; p < 0.05). Male participants thought they were perfectly healthy and more reluctant to agree with maintaining social distance compared to female participants (72.8% male vs 90.1% female; p < 0.001). Participant's satisfaction level with services provided by the government was also significantly different and higher among females than male participants (39.9% male vs 53.5% female; p < 0.05). The majority of the participants reported suffering due to financial uncertainty, psychological distress, and inadequate health facilities. Dissatisfaction was reported with the existing health services as creating several misconceptions, lacking testing facilities, and debasement by the health professionals. Conclusion: This study found a better perception regarding COVID-19 among the young adults, but they had poor preventive practices. Health education intervention with the rapid response should be implemented targeting this vulnerable group to improve their preventive practices.	Prevention
34211650	Resolution of pulmonary artery thrombosis in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease. Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been widely described as the cause for a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state. The inflammatory process involving the alveolar vascular endothelium in the respiratory system, is a determining factor for the onset of primary Pulmonary Artery Thrombosis (PAT) even in patients with heparin prophylactic treatment. Little is known about the efficacy of the anticoagulant therapy during the course of PAT caused by COVID-19. In this paper we describe the results obtained in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease, previously threated with prophylactic enoxaparin, who then received full Anticoagulant treatment after diagnosis of PAT. After three months Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography demonstrated a complete resolution of the vascular obstructive lesions in all patients, while all the coagulation tests were normal.

34199223	Functions of Coronavirus Accessory Proteins: Overview of the State of the Art. Coronavirus accessory proteins are a unique set of proteins whose genes are interspersed among or within the genes encoding structural proteins. Different coronavirus genera, or even different species within the same coronavirus genus, encode varying amounts of accessory proteins, leading to genus- or species-specificity. Though accessory proteins are dispensable for the replication of coronavirus in vitro, they play important roles in regulating innate immunity, viral proliferation, and pathogenicity. The function of accessory proteins on virus infection and pathogenesis is an area of particular interest. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on accessory proteins of several representative coronaviruses that infect humans or animals, including the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with an emphasis on their roles in interaction between virus and host, mainly involving stress response, innate immunity, autophagy, and apoptosis. The cross-talking among these pathways is also discussed.	Mechanism;Treatment
34377494	COVID-19 pneumonia suspected to be co-infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and improved by early administration of favipiravir and ciclesonide. A female nurse in her 40s caring for a patient with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia treated with a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) presented with fever, cough and dyspnoea. Based on imaging findings and a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed, although her cohabiting family had similar symptoms and their RT-PCR tests were negative. Laboratory results showed Mycoplasma antigen (+). She was started on ciclesonide 1200 mug/day and favipiravir (3600 mg/day on the first day and 1600 mg/day from Day 2). As Mycoplasma antigen was positive on admission and her family had similar symptoms, levofloxacin 500 mg/day was started. The patient recovered and was discharged on Day 10. The patient did not have Mycoplasma infection because the Mycoplasma antibody measured by particle agglutination (PA) method was increased only up to 80 times after 4 weeks. This case highlights that healthcare workers wearing full personal protective equipment can nevertheless acquire COVID-19 from patients treated with HFNCs.	Case Report
34341217	Innovations to automate manual ventilation during Covid-19 pandemic and beyond. Manual ventilation by compressing self-inflating bags is a life-saving option for respiratory support in many resource-limited settings. Previous efforts to automate manual ventilation using mechatronic systems were unsuccessful. The Covid-19 pandemic stimulated re-exploration of automating manual ventilation as an economically viable alternative to address the anticipated shortage of mechanical ventilators. Many devices have been developed and displayed in the lay press and social media platforms. However, most are unsuitable for clinical use for a variety of reasons. These include failure to understand the clinical needs, complex ventilatory requirements in Covid-19 patients, lack of technical specifications to guide innovators, technical challenges in delivering ventilation parameters in a physiological manner, absence of guidelines for bench testing of innovative devices and lack of clinical validation in patients. The insights gained during the design, development, laboratory testing and clinical validation of a novel device designated the 'Artificial Breathing Capability Device' are shared here to assist innovators in developing clinically usable devices. A detailed set of clinical requirements from such devices, technical specifications to meet these requirements and framework for bench testing are presented. In addition, regulatory and certification issues, as well as concerns related to the protection of intellectual property, are highlighted. These insights are designed to foster an innovation ecosystem whereby clinically useful automated manual ventilation devices can be developed and deployed to meet the needs associated with the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond.

34221902	Conscious prone positioning in a pregnant patient with COVID-19 respiratory distress: A case report and review. Prone positioning has been used for decades to improve oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. With the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a growing emphasis on the utilization of prone positioning for non-intubated patients as a means of preventing invasive ventilation and improving outcomes. In this case report, a patient is presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in late pregnancy who experienced significant improvements in oxygenation with prone positioning. Additionally, the physiology of prone positioning is reviewed, as well as its mechanism and safety in pregnancy.	Case Report
34212347	Outbreak of COVID-19 on an industrial ship. BACKGROUND: People on ships are at high risk for outbreaks of infectious diseases including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A rapid and well-coordinated response is important to curb transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied an outbreak on an industrial ship to improve outbreak control for ships and coordination between participating harbour partners. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Public Health Service (PHS) Rotterdam-Rijnmond performed an epidemiological investigation during the outbreak of COVID-19 among 77 seafarers on a ship in their port. The captain was interviewed about ship details and his experiences during the outbreak. The seafarers were asked to fill in questionnaires about symptoms suspicious of COVID-19 and date of symptom onset. Information about stakeholders involved in outbreak control was registered. RESULTS: The captain first contacted PHS about probable cases on March 31st 2020 via a physician ashore. One crewmember was hospitalised on April 8th and another died unexpectedly aboard on April 10th. Questionnaires distributed mid-April to the 75 remaining seafarers showed that 38 of 60 responders (63%) had had suspicious symptoms between February 15th and April 13th. None of them were tested but a total of 8 other crewmembers tested positive for COVID-19 after leaving the ship, including the hospitalised crewmember and the one who died aboard. On May 5th, the last case left isolation and the quarantine ended. Many different stakeholders were involved in the outbreak response and responsibilities were not always fully clear beforehand, causing coordination issues. CONCLUSIONS: Testing crew with COVID-19 symptoms underpins control measures and clarifies communication between stakeholders. Building a network beforehand to develop outbreak guidelines tailored to ships and local circumstances is essential to control future outbreaks on ships.	Prevention
34352688	The importance of being external. methodological insights for the external validation of machine learning models in medicine. Background and Objective Medical machine learning (ML) models tend to perform better on data from the same cohort than on new data, often due to overfitting, or co-variate shifts. For these reasons, external validation (EV) is a necessary practice in the evaluation of medical ML. However, there is still a gap in the literature on how to interpret EV results and hence assess the robustness of ML models. METHODS: We fill this gap by proposing a meta-validation method, to assess the soundness of EV procedures. In doing so, we complement the usual way to assess EV by considering both dataset cardinality, and the similarity of the EV dataset with respect to the training set. We then investigate how the notions of cardinality and similarity can be used to inform on the reliability of a validation procedure, by integrating them into two summative data visualizations. RESULTS: We illustrate our methodology by applying it to the validation of a state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnostic model on 8 EV sets, collected across 3 different continents. The model performance was moderately impacted by data similarity (Pearson rho = 0.38, p< 0.001). In the EV, the validated model reported good AUC (average: 0.84), acceptable calibration (average: 0.17) and utility (average: 0.50). The validation datasets were adequate in terms of dataset cardinality and similarity, thus suggesting the soundness of the results. We also provide a qualitative guideline to evaluate the reliability of validation procedures, and we discuss the importance of proper external validation in light of the obtained results. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we propose a novel, lean methodology to: 1) study how the similarity between training and validation sets impacts the generalizability of a ML model; 2) assess the soundness of EV evaluations along three complementary performance dimensions: discrimination, utility and calibration; 3) draw conclusions on the robustness of the model under validation. We applied this methodology to a state-of-the-art model for the diagnosis of COVID-19 from routine blood tests, and showed how to interpret the results in light of the presented framework.	Diagnosis
34206357	Development and Validation of a Method for Quantification of Favipiravir as COVID-19 Management in Spiked Human Plasma. In the current work, a simple, economical, accurate, and precise HPLC method with UV detection was developed to quantify Favipiravir (FVIR) in spiked human plasma using acyclovir (ACVR) as an internal standard in the COVID-19 pandemic time. Both FVIR and ACVR were well separated and resolved on the C18 column using the mobile phase blend of methanol:acetonitrile:20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3.1) in an isocratic mode flow rate of 1 mL/min with a proportion of 30:10:60 %, v/v/v. The detector wavelength was set at 242 nm. Maximum recovery of FVIR and ACVR from plasma was obtained with dichloromethane (DCM) as extracting solvent. The calibration curve was found to be linear in the range of 3.1-60.0 microg/mL with regression coefficient (r(2)) = 0.9976. However, with acceptable r(2), the calibration data's heteroscedasticity was observed, which was further reduced using weighted linear regression with weighting factor 1/x. Finally, the method was validated concerning sensitivity, accuracy (Inter and Intraday's % RE and RSD were 0.28, 0.65 and 1.00, 0.12 respectively), precision, recovery (89.99%, 89.09%, and 90.81% for LQC, MQC, and HQC, respectively), stability (% RSD for 30-day were 3.04 and 1.71 for LQC and HQC, respectively at -20 degrees C), and carry-over US-FDA guidance for Bioanalytical Method Validation for researchers in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Furthermore, there was no significant difference for selectivity when evaluated at LLOQ concentration of 3 microg/mL of FVIR and relative to the blank.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34205932	"Predictive Markers of Immunogenicity and Efficacy for Human Vaccines. Vaccines represent one of the major advances of modern medicine. Despite the many successes of vaccination, continuous efforts to design new vaccines are needed to fight ""old"" pandemics, such as tuberculosis and malaria, as well as emerging pathogens, such as Zika virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Vaccination aims at reaching sterilizing immunity, however assessing vaccine efficacy is still challenging and underscores the need for a better understanding of immune protective responses. Identifying reliable predictive markers of immunogenicity can help to select and develop promising vaccine candidates during early preclinical studies and can lead to improved, personalized, vaccination strategies. A systems biology approach is increasingly being adopted to address these major challenges using multiple high-dimensional technologies combined with in silico models. Although the goal is to develop predictive models of vaccine efficacy in humans, applying this approach to animal models empowers basic and translational vaccine research. In this review, we provide an overview of vaccine immune signatures in preclinical models, as well as in target human populations. We also discuss high-throughput technologies used to probe vaccine-induced responses, along with data analysis and computational methodologies applied to the predictive modeling of vaccine efficacy."

34220286	Mask R-CNN-based building extraction from VHR satellite data in operational humanitarian action: An example related to Covid-19 response in Khartoum, Sudan. Within the constraints of operational work supporting humanitarian organizations in their response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we conducted building extraction for Khartoum, Sudan. We extracted approximately 1.2 million dwellings and buildings, using a Mask R-CNN deep learning approach from a Pleiades very high-resolution satellite image with 0.5 m pixel resolution. Starting from an untrained network, we digitized a few hundred samples and iteratively increased the number of samples by validating initial classification results and adding them to the sample collection. We were able to strike a balance between the need for timely information and the accuracy of the result by combining the output from three different models, each aiming at distinctive types of buildings, in a post-processing workflow. We obtained a recall of 0.78, precision of 0.77 and F 1 score of 0.78, and were able to deliver first results in only 10 days after the initial request. The procedure shows the great potential of convolutional neural network frameworks in combination with GIS routines for dwelling extraction even in an operational setting.	Prevention
34224254	Prevalence of Symptoms More Than Seven Months After Diagnosis of Symptomatic COVID-19 in an Outpatient Setting. BACKGROUND: With millions of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide, increasing numbers of patients are coming forward with long-term clinical effects of the disease lasting several weeks to months. OBJECTIVE: To characterize symptoms 7 to 9 months after diagnosis of COVID-19. DESIGN: Self-reported surveys and semistructured telephone interviews at enrollment and 30 to 45 days and 7 to 9 months from diagnosis. SETTING: From 18 March to 15 May 2020, symptomatic persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the Geneva University Hospitals were followed by CoviCare, a virtual, clinical, outpatient follow-up program. Persons were contacted again at 30 to 45 days and 7 to 9 months from diagnosis. PARTICIPANTS: Persons who were a part of the CoviCare program from 18 March to 15 May 2020. MEASUREMENTS: A standardized interview of symptoms consistent with COVID-19, with grading of intensity. RESULTS: Of the 629 participants in the study who completed the baseline interviews, 410 completed follow-up at 7 to 9 months after COVID-19 diagnosis; 39.0% reported residual symptoms. Fatigue (20.7%) was the most common symptom reported, followed by loss of taste or smell (16.8%), dyspnea (11.7%), and headache (10.0%). LIMITATION: Limitations include generalizability and missing data for 34.8% of participants. CONCLUSION: Residual symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection are common among otherwise young and healthy persons followed in an outpatient setting. These findings contribute to the recognition of long-term effects in a disease mostly counted by its death toll to date by promoting communication on postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 and encouraging physicians to continue long-term monitoring of their patients.

34213845	COVID-19: individual and herd immunity. Immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus ensures protection against reinfection by this virus thanks to the combined action of neutralizing antibodies and T lymphocytes specific to viral proteins, in particular the Spike protein. It must be distinguished from the immune response that ensures healing of the infection following contamination that involves innate immunity, particularly type 1 interferons, and which is followed by adaptive cellular and humoral immunity. The importance of the effect of interferons is highlighted by the occurrence of severe forms of the disease in genetically deficient subjects or in patients with antibodies neutralizing type 1 interferon. Herd immunity is not an individual biological property. It is a mathematical property that qualifies the fact that when the proportion of subjects with individual immunity is high enough, there is little chance that an epidemic can occur. The level of that proportion-the herd immunity of the population can be computed under theoretical, often unrealistic, hypotheses, and is difficult to assess in natural conditions.	Mechanism
34205891	Challenges and Opportunities of Mass Vaccination Centers in COVID-19 Times: A Rapid Review of Literature. A mass vaccination center is a location, normally used for nonhealthcare activities, set up for high-volume and high-speed vaccinations during infectious disease emergencies. The high contagiousness and mortality of COVID-19 and the complete lack of population immunity posed an extraordinary threat for global health. The aim of our research was to collect and review previous experiences on mass vaccination centers. On 4 April 2021, we developed a rapid review searching four electronic databases: PubMed/Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, Google Scholar and medRxiv. From a total of 2312 papers, 15 of them were included in the current review. Among them, only one article described a COVID-19 vaccination center; all of the others referred to other vaccinations, in particular influenza. The majority were conducted in the United States, and were simulations or single-day experiences to practice a mass vaccination after bioterrorist attacks. Indeed, all of them were published after September 11 attacks. Regarding staff, timing and performance, the data were highly heterogenous. Several studies used as a model the Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Results highlighted the differences around the definition, layout and management of a mass vaccination center, but some aspects can be considered as a core aspect. In light of this, we suggested a potential definition. The current review answers to the urgency of organizing a mass vaccination center during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the most important organizational aspects that should be considered in the planning.

34286929	Clinical and epidemiological profile of Indian COVID-19 patients from Jaipur: a descriptive study. We analyzed the data of 102 confirmed patients with novel Coronavirus 2 infection (COVID-19) during the early period of nationwide lockdown announced in India after the declaration of pandemic. We analyzed epidemiological, clinical characteristics and outcome of hospitalization in 102 patients with positive results for novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) RNA testing which were traced on the basis of history of travel, contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, resident of hotspot areas or presence of symptoms, thus providing an accurate estimate of the proportion of asymptomatic cases in the initial population. Of 102 patients enrolled in the study, 83.3% (85/102) were asymptomatic and 16.67% (17/102) were symptomatic. Seventy-seven (75.49%) were males and 24.50% (25/102) were females. Eighteen (17.6%) patients had associated comorbidities, the most prevalent of which were diabetes mellitus 10.8% (11/102), hypertension 7.8% (8/102), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 3.92% (4/102), chronic kidney Disease (CKD) 0.98% (1/102), coronary artery Disease (CAD) 0.98% (1/102) and cerebro-vascular disease (CVD) 0.98% (1/102). The clinical spectrum among symptomatic COVID-19 patients varied from dry cough and fever to respiratory failure and multi-organ failure. Twelve (11.76%) patients were kept in intensive care unit (ICU). Ninety-nine (97.05%) patients recovered while three (2.94%) died during hospital stay. With majority of COVID-19 cases in India being asymptomatic, changes in biochemical and inflammatory profile were small and insignificant in asymptomatic patients when compared to symptomatic patients. Elevated NLR, lymphopenia, age and presence of comorbidities were associated with increased severity and poor outcome.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34222797	Coronary artery calcification and risk of mortality and adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19: a Chinese multicenter retrospective cohort study. Background: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an independent risk factor of major adverse cardiovascular events; however, the impact of CAC on in-hospital death and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. Objective: To explore the association between CAC and in-hospital mortality and adverse events in patients with COVID-19. Methods: This multicenter retrospective cohort study enrolled 2067 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with definitive clinical outcomes (death or discharge) admitted from 22 tertiary hospitals in China between January 3, 2020 and April 2, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory results, chest CT findings, and CAC on admission were collected. The primary outcome was in-hospital death and the secondary outcome was composed of in-hospital death, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), and requiring mechanical ventilation. Multivariable Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier plots were used to explore the association between CAC and in-hospital death and adverse clinical outcomes. Results: The mean age was 50 years (SD,16) and 1097 (53.1%) were male. A total of 177 patients showed high CAC level, and compared with patients with low CAC, these patients were older (mean age: 49 vs. 69 years, P < 0.001) and more likely to be male (52.0% vs. 65.0%, P = 0.001). Comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) ([33.3%, 59/177] vs. [4.7%, 89/1890], P < 0.001), presented more often among patients with high CAC, compared with patients with low CAC. As for laboratory results, patients with high CAC had higher rates of increased D-dimer, LDH, as well as CK-MB (all P < 0.05). The mean CT severity score in high CAC group was also higher than low CAC group (12.6 vs. 11.1, P = 0.005). In multivariable Cox regression model, patients with high CAC were at a higher risk of in-hospital death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.731; 95% CI 1.010-2.971, P = 0.046) and adverse clinical outcomes (HR, 1.611; 95% CL 1.087-2.387, P = 0.018). Conclusion: High CAC is a risk factor associated with in-hospital death and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with confirmed COVID-19, which highlights the importance of calcium load testing for hospitalized COVID-19 patients and calls for attention to patients with high CAC.

34200818	Extracellular Vesicles of Mesenchymal Stem Cells: Therapeutic Properties Discovered with Extraordinary Success. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the cells distributed in the stromas of the body, are known for various properties including replication, the potential of various differentiations, the immune-related processes including inflammation. About two decades ago, these cells were shown to play relevant roles in the therapy of numerous diseases, dependent on their immune regulation and their release of cytokines and growth factors, with ensuing activation of favorable enzymes and processes. Such discovery induced great increase of their investigation. Soon thereafter, however, it became clear that therapeutic actions of MSCs are risky, accompanied by serious drawbacks and defects. MSC therapy has been therefore reduced to a few diseases, replaced for the others by their extracellular vesicles, the MSC-EVs. The latter vesicles recapitulate most therapeutic actions of MSCs, with equal or even better efficacies and without the serious drawbacks of the parent cells. In addition, MSC-EVs are characterized by many advantages, among which are their heterogeneities dependent on the stromas of origin, the alleviation of cell aging, the regulation of immune responses and inflammation. Here we illustrate the MSC-EV therapeutic effects, largely mediated by specific miRNAs, covering various diseases and pathological processes occurring in the bones, heart and vessels, kidney, and brain. MSC-EVs operate also on the development of cancers and on COVID-19, where they alleviate the organ lesions induced by the virus. Therapy by MSC-EVs can be improved by combination of their innate potential to engineering processes inducing precise targeting and transfer of drugs. The unique properties of MSC-EVs explain their intense studies, carried out with extraordinary success. Although not yet developed to clinical practice, the perspectives for proximal future are encouraging.	Mechanism;Treatment
34228411	[What are the differences between the various covid-19 vaccines?] The coronavirus pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination appears to offer the way out of this pandemic. Vaccines against this virus make use of the SARS-CoV-2's spike protein, an essential protein on the surface of the virus that it uses to attach itself to the host cells. In viral vector vaccines (AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Johnson & Johnson) the gene for the spike protein is introduced into an adenovirus. Following vaccination, the modified adenovirus will infect cells of the host, which will subsequently start to produce the spike protein, causing an immune response. RNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) only introduce messenger RNA for the spike protein into host cells, which the messenger RNA uses to produce spike protein. Viral vector vaccines and RNA vaccines are not only faster to develop and safer to produce than traditional vaccines, they are also easier to modify to new viruses and virus variants. The latter may be of great importance for future pandemics.	Mechanism;Treatment
34354712	Dynamic Characteristic Analysis of Antibodies in Patients With COVID-19: A 13-Month Study. There is a worldwide pandemic of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection; yet our understanding remains limited on the characteristic of antibodies, especially for dynamic long-term tracking. Sequential serum samples were collected up to 416 days post onset of symptoms (POS) from 102 patients who were hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, and IgA levels targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 receptor-binding domain (S1-RBD), spike 2 extracellular domain (S2-ECD), and nucleocapsid protein (N) were quantified as well as neutralizing activity. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the antibody remained detective and effective for more than a year POS. We also found the varied reactions of different antibodies as time passed: N-IgA rose most rapidly in the early stage of infection, while S2-IgG was present at a high level in the long time of observation. This study described the long traceable antibody response of the COVID-19 and offered hints about targets to screen for postinfectious immunity and for vaccination development of SARS-CoV-2.

34290378	Impact of repeated nasal sampling on detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2. The impact of repeated sample collection on COVID-19 test performance is unknown. The FDA and CDC currently recommend the primary collection of diagnostic samples to minimize the perceived risk of false-negative findings. We therefore evaluated the association between repeated sample collection and test performance among 325 symptomatic patients undergoing COVID-19 testing in Atlanta, GA. High concordance was found between consecutively collected mid-turbinate samples with both molecular (n = 74, 100% concordance) and antigen-based (n = 147, 97% concordance, kappa = 0.95, CI = 0.88-1.00) diagnostic assays. Repeated sample collection does not decrease COVID-19 test performance, demonstrating that multiple samples can be collected for assay validation and clinical diagnosis.	Diagnosis

The population's behavioral responses to containment and precautionary measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have played a fundamental role in controlling the contagion. A comparative analysis of precautionary behaviors in the region was carried out. A total of 1184 people from Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Cuba, and Guatemala participated through an online survey containing a questionnaire on sociodemographic factors, precautionary behaviors, information about COVID-19, concerns, maintenance of confinement, and medical symptoms associated with COVID-19. Cubans reported the highest scores for information about COVID-19. Colombians reported less frequent usage of precautionary measures (e.g., use of masks), but greater adherence to confinement recommendations in general, in contrast to the low levels of these behaviors in Guatemalans. Chileans reported greater pandemic-related concerns and the highest number of medical symptoms associated with COVID-19. These findings allow a partial characterization of the Latin American population's responses during the second and third phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of designing and managing public health policies according to the circumstances of each population when facing pandemics.

34219967	Numerical simulation and stability analysis of a novel reaction-diffusion COVID-19 model. In this study, a novel reaction-diffusion model for the spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is investigated. The model is a spatial extension of the recent COVID-19 SEIR model with nonlinear incidence rates by taking into account the effects of random movements of individuals from different compartments in their environments. The equilibrium points of the new system are found for both diffusive and non-diffusive models, where a detailed stability analysis is conducted for them. Moreover, the stability regions in the space of parameters are attained for each equilibrium point for both cases of the model and the effects of parameters are explored. A numerical verification for the proposed model using a finite difference-based method is illustrated along with their consistency, stability and proving the positivity of the acquired solutions. The obtained results reveal that the random motion of individuals has significant impact on the observed dynamics and steady-state stability of the spread of the virus which helps in presenting some strategies for the better control of it.

34346755	COVID-19 Cases from the First Local Outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 Variant in China May Present More Serious Clinical Features: A Prospective, Comparative Cohort Study. The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant has increased sharply in numbers worldwide and is reported to be more contagious than the nonvariant. Little is known regarding the detailed clinical features of B.1.1.7 variant infection. Data on 74 COVID-19 cases from two outbreaks in two districts of Beijing, China were extracted from a cloud database, including 41 cases from Shunyi District (Shunyi B.1.470 group) and 33 from Daxing (Daxing B.1.1.7 group) from December 25, 2020 to January 17, 2021. We conducted a comparison of the clinical characteristics. Seven clinical indicators of the Daxing B.1.1.7 group were significantly higher than those of the Shunyi group, including the proportion with fever over 38 degrees C, the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), creatine kinase (CK), d-dimer (DD), and CD4(+) T lymphocytes (CD4(+) T), and the proportion with ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the lung (P values of </=0.05). After adjusting for age, B.1.1.7 variant infection was a risk factor for elevated CRP (P = 0.045), SAA (P = 0.011), CK (P = 0.034), and CD4(+) T (P = 0.029) and for the presence of GGO (P = 0.005). The median threshold cycle (CT) value of reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) tests of the N gene target in the Daxing B.1.1.7 group was significantly lower (P = 0.036) than that in the Shunyi B.1.470 group. Clinical features, including a more serious inflammatory response, pneumonia, and a possibly higher viral load, were detected in the cases infected with B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2. The B.1.1.7 variant may have increased pathogenicity. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant, which was first identified in the United Kingdom, has increased sharply in numbers worldwide and was reported to be more contagious than the nonvariant. To our knowledge, no studies investigating the detailed clinical features of COVID-19 cases infected with the B.1.1.7 variant have been published. Local epidemics have rarely occurred in China, but occasionally, a small clustered outbreak triggered by an imported SARS-CoV-2 strain with only one chain of transmission could happen. From late 2020 to early 2021, two clustered COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in Beijing, one of which was caused by the B.1.1.7 variant. The COVID-19 patients from the two outbreaks received similar clinical tests, diagnoses, and treatments. We found that the B.1.1.7 variant infection could lead to a more serious inflammatory response, acute response process, more severe pneumonia, and probably higher viral loads. This therefore implies that the B.1.1.7 variant may have increased pathogenicity.	Diagnosis
34288726	Evaluation of cell-based and surrogate SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays. Determinants of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection require the development of well-standardized, reproducible antibody assays. This need has led to the emergence of a variety of neutralization assays. Head-to-head evaluation of different SARS-CoV-2 neutralization platforms could facilitate comparisons across studies and laboratories. Five neutralization assays were compared using forty plasma samples from convalescent individuals with mild-to-moderate COVID-19: four cell-based systems using either live recombinant SARS-CoV-2 or pseudotyped viral particles created with lentivirus (LV) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) packaging and one surrogate ELISA-based test that measures inhibition of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) binding its receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Vero, Vero E6, HEK293T expressing hACE2, and TZM-bl cells expressing hACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 were tested. All cell-based assays showed 50% neutralizing dilution (ND50) geometric mean titers (GMTs) that were highly correlated (Pearson r = 0.81-0.89) and ranged within 3.4-fold. The live-virus assay and LV-pseudovirus assays with HEK293T/hACE2 cells showed very similar mean titers: 141 and 178, respectively. ND50 titers positively correlated with plasma IgG targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD (r = 0.63-0.89), but moderately correlated with nucleoprotein IgG (r = 0.46-0.73). ND80 GMTs mirrored ND50 data and showed similar correlation between assays and with IgG concentrations. The VSV-pseudovirus assay and LV-pseudovirus assay with HEK293T/hACE2 cells in low and high-throughput versions were calibrated against the WHO SARS-CoV-2 IgG standard. High concordance between the outcomes of cell-based assays with live and pseudotyped virions enables valid cross-study comparison using these platforms. 249.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34223651	Effective Lockdown and Role of Hospital-Based COVID-19 Transmission in Some Indian States: An Outbreak Risk Analysis. Several reports in India indicate hospitals and quarantined centers are COVID-19 hotspots. To study the transmission occurring from the hospitals and as well as from the community, we developed a mechanistic model with a lockdown effect. Using daily COVID-19 cases data from six states and overall India, we estimated several important parameters of our model. Moreover, we provided an estimation of the effective (RT ), the basic (R0 ), the community (RC ), and the hospital (RH ) reproduction numbers. We forecast COVID-19 notified cases from May 3, 2020, till May 20, 2020, under five different lockdown scenarios in the seven locations. Our analysis suggests that 65% to 99% of the new COVID-19 cases are currently asymptomatic in those locations. Besides, about 1-16% of the total COVID-19 transmission are currently occurring from hospital-based contact and these percentage can increase up to 69% in some locations. Furthermore, the hospital-based transmission rate (beta2 ) has significant positive (0.65 to 0.8) and negative (-0.58 to -0.23) correlation with R0 and the effectiveness of lockdown, respectively. Therefore, a much larger COVID-19 outbreak may trigger from the hospital-based transmission. In most of the locations, model forecast from May 3, 2020, till May 20, 2020, indicates a two-times increase in cumulative cases in comparison to total observed cases up to April 29, 2020. Based on our results, we proposed a containment policy that may reduce the threat of a larger COVID-19 outbreak in the future.	Prevention;Transmission
34221444	Bubble concept for sporting tournaments during the COVID-19 pandemic: Football Club World Cup. Objectives: To report the person-to-staff transmission of COVID-19 with the implementation of a bubble concept that included testing, hygiene, distancing and monitoring strategies to mitigate risks. Methods: A prospective case series included all staff on-site involved in the Football Club World Cup. The tournament was conducted within 'bubbles'. All personnel travelling to the tournament were required to be in possession of a negative RT-PCR test within 72 hours of arrival and subjected to a testing schedule during the tournament. Each location was assigned a COVID-19 protocol enforcement officer to ensure adherence to regular testing, hygiene measures, physical distancing and daily symptom reporting (via ScribePro app). Results: The study involved 70 recruited staff with a combined 1321 test days on the symptom checker app. The mean number of days completed on the symptom checker app was 18.87 days (range: 7-28). Of the five questions asked as part of the daily symptom checker, only one was answered positively (0.015%). This individual was isolated, assessed within 20 min and tested. The initial diagnosis was likely a non-COVID-19-related viral illness. Further testing returned three negative tests during the remainder of the tournament. Conclusions: There was no person-to-staff transmission of COVID-19 during the tournament within our sample. The organisation of a sporting tournament during the COVID-19 pandemic is possible with risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include setting up a bubble with regular testing, hygiene measures, physical distancing and daily symptom reporting.	Prevention
34204972	"Burden of COVID-19 on Italian Internal Medicine Wards: Delphi, SWOT, and Performance Analysis after Two Pandemic Waves in the Local Health Authority ""Roma 6"" Hospital Structures. Background: COVID-19 causes major changes in day-to-day hospital activity due to its epidemiological characteristics and the clinical challenges it poses, especially in internal medicine wards. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and manage all of the implicated factors in order to maintain a high standard of care, even in sub-par circumstances. Methods: This was a three-phase, mixed-design study. Initially, the Delphi method allowed us to analyze the causes of poor outcomes in a cohort of an aggregate of Italian COVID-19 wards via an Ishikawa diagram. Then, for each retrieved item, a score was assigned according to a pros/cons, opportunities/threats system. Scores were also assigned according to potential value/perceived risk. Finally, the performances of MCs (Medicine-COVID-19 wards) and MCFs (Medicine-COVID-19-free: Internal Medicine wards) units were represented via a Barber's nomogram. Results: MCFs hospitalized 790 patients (-23.90% compared to 2019 Internal Medicine admissions). The main risk factors for mortality were patients admitted from local facilities (+7%) and the presence of comorbidities (>3: 100%, >/=5: 24.7%). A total of 197 (25%) patients were treated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV). The most deaths (57.14%) occurred in patients admitted from local facilities. Conclusions: Medicine-COVID-19 wards show higher complexity and demand compared to non-COVID-19 ones and they are comparable to sub-intensive therapy wards. It is necessary to promote the use of NIV in such settings."	Prevention
34377775	"Changes in Patient Satisfaction Scores During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a rapid and widespread application of telemedicine services in the outpatient setting. Prior to COVID-19, patient satisfaction was measured with Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Clinician & Group Survey (CG-CAHPS) and was then measured with the Press Ganey telemedicine survey. Both surveys ask about a patient's likelihood to recommend a particular medical practice, which is a useful, but imperfect, surrogate for overall satisfaction. The purpose of this analysis was to identify any changes in patient satisfaction scores with the implementation of telemedicine services. A retrospective analysis of our institution's experience during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the months immediately prior to the pandemic was conducted. The percent of patients with a ""Top box"" response to survey questions regarding their likelihood to recommend a medical practice were compared. A total of 14 430 CG-CAHPS results collected in November 2019 through February 2020 were compared to 22 009 telemedicine survey results collected between March and May 2020. In general, most medical specialties incorporated telemedicine but suffered a decrease in their patient's likelihood to recommend a medical practice during the first few months of the pandemic. However, the magnitude of this decrease was variable by medical specialty. Physical medicine and rehabilitation and pain medicine had relatively poor scores prior to the pandemic which did not statistically change. Oncology was the sole medical specialty that continued to have unchanged high patient satisfaction scores. These data provide insights for the refinement of telemedicine."	Prevention
34215570	Quality of life in patients with IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 has put a strain on regular healthcare worldwide. For inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), gastrointestinal surgeries were postponed and changes in treatment and diagnostic procedures were made. As abrupt changes in treatment regimens may result in an increased morbidity and consequent well-being of patients with IBD, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with IBD. DESIGN: All patients with IBD who completed both Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire between 31 August and 13 September 2020 were included in our cohort study. The primary end point was to determine the HRQoL in patients with IBD, measured by the IBDQ and SF-36 questionnaire. The secondary end point was determining which factors influence the HRQoL in patients with IBD. RESULTS: 582 patients with IBD filled in the IBDQ and SF-36 questionnaire. The HRQoL in our study population was low according to the questionnaires on both physical and mental subscales. In addition, multivariate analysis showed that increased age, female sex and patients who underwent surgery had a significantly lower HRQoL, most frequently on the physical domains in both questionnaires. CONCLUSION: Patients with IBD had an overall low HRQoL during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, older patients, women and patients who underwent surgical procedures had the lowest physical HRQoL.

34227581	The front-line during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: healthcare personnel. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An estimated four to 11% of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases occurs in healthcare personnel (HCP). HCP are at high risk of acquiring and transmitting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) given their close contact with individuals with recognized and unrecognized COVID-19. We summarize the literature to date describing the epidemiology, identifying risk factors associated with COVID-19, and analyzing clinical characteristics and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCP. RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCP ranges from 0.7 to 45%. Although there is heterogeneity in the seroprevalence rate reported in the literature, HCP may be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from exposure to patients with COVID-19. The literature supports that this can be minimized with adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supply, proper hand hygiene, appropriate PPE use, and other infection prevention measures. In addition, infections in HCP are commonly acquired in the community as well as in nonclinical care settings including break rooms or work rooms. SUMMARY: While much focus has been on minimizing patient-to-HCP transmission of SARS-CoV-2, additional efforts are needed to prevent exposures in nonclinical care settings and in the community.

34361227	Nanotechnology Integration for SARS-CoV-2 Diagnosis and Treatment: An Approach to Preventing Pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is the COVID-19 disease, which has caused massive health devastation, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a worldwide health emergency. The corona virus infected millions of people worldwide, and many died as a result of a lack of particular medications. The current emergency necessitates extensive therapy in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus. There are various vaccinations available, but no validated COVID-19 treatments. Since its outbreak, many therapeutics have been tested, including the use of repurposed medications, nucleoside inhibitors, protease inhibitors, broad spectrum antivirals, convalescence plasma therapies, immune-modulators, and monoclonal antibodies. However, these approaches have not yielded any outcomes and are mostly used to alleviate symptoms associated with potentially fatal adverse drug reactions. Nanoparticles, on the other hand, may prove to be an effective treatment for COVID-19. They can be designed to boost the efficacy of currently available antiviral medications or to trigger a rapid immune response against COVID-19. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in nanotechnology. This review focuses on the virus's basic structure, pathogenesis, and current treatment options for COVID-19. This study addresses nanotechnology and its applications in diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and targeted vaccine delivery, laying the groundwork for a successful pandemic fight.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34199319	Endothelial Cell Participation in Inflammatory Reaction. Inflammation is an old concept that has started to be considered as an important factor in infection and chronic diseases. The role of leukocytes, the plasmatic components, then of the mediators such as prostaglandins, cytokines, and, in recent decades, of the endothelium has completed the concept of the inflammation process. The function of the endothelium appeared to be crucial as a regulator or the initiator of the inflammatory process. Culture of human endothelial cells and experimental systems made it possible to define the molecular basis of inflammation in vascular diseases, in diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, vasculitis and thromboembolic complications. Advanced glycation end product receptor (RAGE), present on endothelial cells (ECs) and monocytes, participates in the activation of these cells in inflammatory conditions. Inflammasome is a cytosolic multiprotein that controls the response to diverse microorganisms. It is positively regulated by stimulator of interferon response CGAMP interactor-1 (STING1). Angiogenesis and thrombotic events are dysregulated during inflammation. ECs appear to be a protector, but also a possible initiator of thrombosis.	Mechanism;Treatment
34335996	Effects of air pollution and climatology on COVID-19 mortality in Spain. The health, economic, and social impact of COVID-19 has been significant across the world. Our objective was to evaluate the association between air pollution (through NO2 and PM2.5 levels) and COVID-19 mortality in Spanish provinces from February 3, 2020, to July 14, 2020, adjusting for climatic parameters. An observational and ecological study was conducted with information extracted from Datadista repository (Datadista, 2020). Air pollutants (NO2 and PM2.5 levels) were analyzed as potential determinants of COVID-19 mortality. Multilevel Poisson regression models were used to analyze the risk of mortality after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Models were adjusted by four climatic variables (hours of solar radiation, precipitation, daily temperature and wind speed) and population size. The mean levels of PM2.5 and NO2 across all provinces and time in Spain were 8.7 mug/m(3) (SD 9.7) and 8.7 mug/m(3) (SD 6.2), respectively. High levels of PM2.5 (IRR = 1.016, 95% CI: 1.007-1.026), NO2 (IRR = 1.066, 95% CI: 1.058-1.075) and precipitation (IRRNO2 = 0.989, 95% CI: 0.981-0.997) were positively associated with COVID-19 mortality, whereas temperature (IRRPM2.5 = 0.988, 95% CI: 0.976-1.000; and IRRNO2 = 0.771, 95% CI: 0.761-0.782, respectively) and wind speed (IRRNO2 = 1.095, 95% CI: 1.061-1.131) were negatively associated with COVID-19 mortality. Air pollution can be a key factor to understand the mortality rate for COVID-19 in Spain. Furthermore, climatic variables could be influencing COVID-19 progression. Thus, air pollution and climatology ought to be taken into consideration in order to control the pandemic.

34339862	Absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pre-pandemic plasma from children and adults in Vietnam. We tested pre-pandemic (2015-2019) plasma samples from 148 Vietnamese children, and 100 Vietnamese adults at high risk of zoonotic infections, for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins. None was positive. The data thus demonstrated that there was no evidence of prior serological cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 that might explain the low numbers of COVID-19 in Vietnam. Future studies should look at pre-existing B cell and T cell memory in pre-pandemic samples in Vietnam, which might further shed light on the pathogenesis of the infection.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
34343845	Feasibility of assessment of skeletal muscle mass on a single cross-sectional image at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra. BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) determined on computed tomography (CT) is emerging as a novel imaging biomarker. Cross-sectional area (CSA) of SMM at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) on abdominal imaging is considered the clinical reference standard for measuring SMM. In certain patient groups, such as those with oncological or non-oncological lung disease like COVID-19, a chest CT may be available while an abdominal CT is not. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether determining SMM on a chest CT is a feasible alternative to abdominal CT. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the correlation between SMM measurements at the level of L3 and the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra (Th4)? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study we retrospectively analyzed abdominal and thoracic series of whole-body CT-scans of trauma patients (N = 47) and head and neck cancer patients (N = 194). All abdominal muscles were delineated on a single axial slice at the level of L3. The erector spinae, levator scapulae, rhomboideus minor and major and pectoralis minor and major muscles were delineated on a single axial slice at the level of Th4. CSA of the muscles at Th4 and the L3 level were compared using linear regression, and a multivariate linear regression model was established. RESULTS: Muscle CSA at level Th4 strongly correlates with L3 muscle CSA (r = 0.791, p < 0.05). A multivariate model incorporating the patient characteristics arm positioning, age, sex, and weight achieved a stronger correlation (r = 0.856, p < 0.05). INTERPRETATION: Skeletal muscle CSA measured at the level of Th4 is a feasible alternative to measurements at L3. This allows diagnosing low SMM using clinically available thoracic CT-scans. SMM measurements at the level of Th4 may become a prognostic or triage tool when faced with mechanical ventilator shortage.	Diagnosis
34208156	Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior and Well-Being of Adults with Physical Disabilities and/or Chronic Diseases during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Rapid Review. Background: People with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases report lower levels of physical activity and well-being than the general population, which potentially is exacerbated through the COVID-19 pandemic. This study explored the international literature on physical activity, sedentary behavior and well-being in adults with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases during the first wave of the pandemic. Method: In a rapid review, we included studies reporting on physical activity, sedentary behavior and/or well-being in adults with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases. Four databases (Pubmed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Embase) were searched for studies published until 30 September 2020. Results: We included twenty-nine studies involving eleven different types of disabilities or health conditions from twenty-one different countries. Twenty-six studies reported on physical activity, of which one reported an increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, four studies reported no difference, and twenty-one studies reported a decrease. Thirteen studies reported a decline in well-being. Only one study measured sedentary behavior, reporting an increase. Conclusion: Despite the variety in methods used, almost all studies reported negative impacts on physical activity and well-being in people with physical disabilities and/or chronic disease during the first wave of the pandemic. These findings highlight the importance of supporting this population, especially in times of crisis.	Prevention
34213801	Does chronic inflammation cause acute inflammation to spiral into hyper-inflammation in a manner modulated by diet and the gut microbiome, in severe Covid-19? We propose that hyper-inflammation (HYPi) is a ''runaway'' consequence of acute inflammation (ACUi) that arises more easily (and also abates less easily) in those who host a pre-existing chronic inflammation (CHRi), because (i) most factors involved in generating an ACUi to limit viral proliferation are already present when there is an underlying CHRi, and also because (ii) anti-inflammatory (AI) mechanisms for the abatement of ACUi (following containment of viral proliferation) are suppressed and desensitized where there is an underlying CHRi, with this causing the ACUi to spiral into a HYPi. Stress, pollution, diet, and gut microbiomes (alterable in weeks through dietary changes) have an intimate and bidirectional cause-effect relationship with CHRi. We propose that avoidance of CHRi-promoting foods and adoption of CHRi-suppressing foods could reduce susceptibility to HYPi, in Covid-19 and in other viral diseases, such as influenza, which are characterized by episodic and unpredictable HYPi.

34286505	Immunohistochemical findings in the lungs of COVID-19 subjects: evidence of surfactant dysregulation. OBJECTIVE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by quantitative and qualitative changes in surfactant composition, leading to surfactant dysregulation with alveolar collapse and acute respiratory hypoxic failure. Recently, surfactant has been hypothesized to play a relevant role in COVID-19, representing a strong defender against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of our work was the study of immunohistochemical surfactant expression in the lungs of patients died following SARS-CoV-2 ARDS, in order to shed light on a possible therapeutic surfactant administration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated four patients who died due to ARDS following SARS-COV-2 infection and four patients submitted to lung biopsy, in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In all 8 cases, lung specimens were immunostained with anti-surfactant protein A (SP-A) and B (SP-B). RESULTS: In control subjects, reactivity for SP-B was restricted to type II alveolar cells. Immunostaining for SP-A was observed on the surface of alveolar spaces. In the COVID-19 positive lungs, immunoreactivity for SP-B was similar to that observed in control lungs; SP-A was strongly expressed along the alveolar wall. Moreover, dense aggregates of SP-A positive material were observed in the alveolar spaces. CONCLUSIONS: Our immunohistochemical data show the dysregulation of surfactant production in COVID-19 patients, particularly regarding SP-A expression. The increased presence of SP-A in condensed masses inside alveolar spaces could invalidate the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment with exogenous surfactant.	Mechanism;Treatment
34289657	Complement dysregulation is associated with severe COVID-19 illness. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) may manifest as thrombosis, stroke, renal failure, myocardial infarction, and thrombocytopenia, reminiscent of other complement-mediated diseases. Multiple clinical and preclinical studies have implicated complement in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 illness. We previously found that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein activates the alternative pathway of complement (APC) in vitro through interfering with the function of complement factor H, a key negative regulator of APC. Here, we demonstrated that serum from 58 COVID-19 patients (32 patients with minimal oxygen requirement, 7 on high flow oxygen, 17 requiring mechanical ventilation and 2 deaths) can induce complement-mediated cell death in a functional assay (the modified Ham test) and increase membrane attack complex (C5b-9) deposition on the cell surface. A positive mHam assay (>20% cellkilling) was present in 41.2% COVID-19 patients requiring intubation (n=7/17) and only 6.3% in COVID-19 patients requiring minimal oxygen support (n=2/32). C5 and factor D inhibition effectively mitigated the complement amplification induced by COVID-19 patient serum. Increased serum factor Bb level was associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that APC dysregulation plays an important role. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins directly block complement factor H from binding to heparin, which may lead to complement dysregulation on the cell surface. Taken together, our data suggest that complement dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and may be a marker of disease severity.	Mechanism;Treatment;Diagnosis
34289840	Healthcare workers' perspectives on coronavirus testing availability: a cross sectional survey. BACKGROUND: Studies on the impact of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID) for healthcare workers (HCWs) rarely include the full spectrum of hospital workers, including less visible patient support roles. In the early days of the pandemic, COVID testing was preferentially available to HCWs. The objective of this study was to understand how individual experiences for all HCWs during the pandemic were associated with perceptions of access to, and receipt of COVID testing . METHODS: All hospital employees (n = 6736) in a single academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey regarding perceived access to, and receipt of COVID testing during the first wave of the pandemic (March - August 2020). Responses were linked to human resources data. Log binomial univariate and multivariable models were used to estimate associations between individual and employment variables and COVID testing. RESULTS: A total of 2543 employees responded to the survey (38 %). The mean age was 40 years (+/- 14). Respondents were female (76 %), white (55 %), worked as nurses (27 %), administrators (22 %) and patient support roles (22 %); 56 % of respondents wanted COVID testing. Age (RR 0.91, CI 0.88-0.93), full time status (RR 0.85, CI 0.79-0.92), employment tenure (RR 0.96, CI 0.94-0.98), changes in quality of life (RR 0.94, CI 0.91-0.96), changes in job duties (RR 1.19, CI 1.03-1.37), and worry about enough paid sick leave (RR 1.21, CI 1.12-1.30) were associated with interest in testing. Administrators (RR 0.64, CI 0.58-0.72) and patient support staff (RR 0.85, CI 0.78-0.92) were less likely than nurses to want testing. Age (RR 1.04, CI 1.01-1.07), material hardships (RR 0.87, CI 0.79-0.96), and employer sponsored insurance (RR 1.10, CI 1.00-1.22) were associated with receiving a COVID test. Among all employees, only administrative/facilities staff were less likely to receive COVID testing (RR 0.69, CI 0.59-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to our understanding of how hospital employees view availability of COVID testing. Hazard pay or other supports for hospital workers may increase COVID testing rates. These findings may be applicable to perceived barriers towards vaccination receipt.	Prevention
34283495	"Non-dieting Approaches To Treatment Of Obesity A body mass index of >/=30 (>27 in those of Asian descent) kilograms per square meter constitutes the definition of obesity.[1] Obesity involves a complex interplay of genetic, sociocultural, environmental, and behavioral factors. In 1997, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared obesity a major global health issue along with undernutrition and climate change-the triad being termed ""the Global Syndemic.""[2] Today in the United States of America (USA), one-third of the adult population is obese, with the Center for Disease Control projecting that by 2050 60% of men and 40% of women in the USA will be obese.[3] Obesity once again came into focus during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, when patients with obesity were found to have an increased need for mechanical ventilation and higher mortality.[4] Once thought to be an exclusive problem of the developed world, numerous studies have shown developing countries now have the highest incidence of obesity. South-East Asians have a higher percentage of body fat, truncal/central obesity, and insulin resistance than their White race counterparts prompting the WHO to endorse a lower cut-off point for action against obesity at >/=27kg/m^2 in the Asian population.[5] The latest terminology introduced for obesity is ABCD-adiposity based chronic disease, which shifts the focus to the chronic nature of obesity and its comorbidities, which require treatment in addition to the treatment of obesity itself.[6] It is well known that obesity is associated with a shortened life span and increased incidence of obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, gout, polycystic ovarian syndrome, metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, hypertension, stroke, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, heart failure, and cancers of the colon, breast, endometrium, and gallbladder.[7] Thus the treatment of obesity is essential, along with early identification of complications. Although this article focuses on non-dieting approaches to treating obesity with medications, gastrointestinal devices, and bariatric surgery, it must be emphasized that diet and exercise are essential to good cardiometabolic health in obese patients."

34208858	Implementation of Triage System and Shortening Patient Journey Time to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in a University Hospital during a Pandemic. To explore the characteristics of the patient under investigation (PUI), and the routes and the patient journey time in our outpatient service, we examined the demographic data, presenting symptoms, risks of contact with COVID-19 cases, and the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in PUI cases from March to May 2020. The contact time, transfer time and total journey time of patient journey routes in our hospital were also explored. The results were shown in numbers, percentages and medians (interquartile range, IQR). A total of 334 PUI cases were identified from our triage system. The median (IQR) age was 35 (27, 47) years. Cough was the most common presenting symptom (56.2%), while fever (>/=37.5 degrees C) was found in only 19.8% of the cases. The median (IQR) time of onset of the presenting symptoms was 3 (1, 5) days. The most common risk of contact with COVID-19 cases found during the triage was living in or returning from an outbreak area. Fifteen (4.5%) of the PUI cases had positive real-time PCR tests. The contact time and transfer time were longest in the PUI ward and from the Emergency Department (ED) to the PUI ward, respectively. Plans and actions to shorten the transfer time between the ED and the PUI ward and the total journey time should be developed.	Prevention;Transmission
34221943	The Importance of Happy Hypoxemia in COVID-19. Background: Nowadays, the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its complications are one of the main concerns of the world. One of the most severe complications of COVID-19 is hypoxemia. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the importance of happy hypoxemia in COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched web of science, PubMed, and Google scholar databases to find articles related to COVID-19 and happy hypoxemia. Results: COVID-19 causes a type of hypoxemia named silent (happy) hypoxemia, which has an atypical clinical presentation. This type of hypoxemia has not been noted before in viral pneumonia, and there is no specific treatment for this serious complication. Patients with silent hypoxemia may develop severe hypoxemia without dyspnea and with near-normal lung compliance. These patients are awake, calm, and responsive. Although their lungs are not oxygenated efficiently, they are alert and cooperative. Their condition may be deteriorated rapidly without warning and causes death. Conclusions: According to the findings, paying attention to happy hypoxemia is important for improving the health status of COVID-19 patients.	Treatment;Diagnosis
34282139	SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics and transmission from community-wide serological testing in the Italian municipality of Vo'. In February and March 2020, two mass swab testing campaigns were conducted in Vo', Italy. In May 2020, we tested 86% of the Vo' population with three immuno-assays detecting antibodies against the spike and nucleocapsid antigens, a neutralisation assay and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Subjects testing positive to PCR in February/March or a serological assay in May were tested again in November. Here we report on the results of the analysis of the May and November surveys. We estimate a seroprevalence of 3.5% (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 2.8-4.3%) in May. In November, 98.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 93.7-100.0%) of sera which tested positive in May still reacted against at least one antigen; 18.6% (95% CI: 11.0-28.5%) showed an increase of antibody or neutralisation reactivity from May. Analysis of the serostatus of the members of 1,118 households indicates a 26.0% (95% CrI: 17.2-36.9%) Susceptible-Infectious Transmission Probability.

34287111	Real-world impact of vaccination on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence in healthcare personnel at an academic medical center. OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination effectiveness in healthcare personnel (HCP) has been established. However, questions remain regarding its performance in high-risk healthcare occupations and work locations. We describe the effect of a COVID-19 HCP vaccination campaign on SARS-CoV-2 infection by timing of vaccination, job type, and work location. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance, incidence of postvaccination COVID-19, hospitalization, and mortality among 16,156 faculty, students, and staff at a large academic medical center. Data were collected 8 weeks prior to the start of phase 1a vaccination of frontline employees and ended 11 weeks after campaign onset. RESULTS: The COVID-19 incidence rate among HCP at our institution decreased from 3.2% during the 8 weeks prior to the start of vaccinations to 0.38% by 4 weeks after campaign initiation. COVID-19 risk was reduced among individuals who received a single vaccination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.68; P < .0001) and was further reduced with 2 doses of vaccine (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.09-0.32; P < .0001). By 2 weeks after the second dose, the observed case positivity rate was 0.04%. Among phase 1a HCP, we observed a lower risk of COVID-19 among physicians and a trend toward higher risk for respiratory therapists independent of vaccination status. Rates of infection were similar in a subgroup of nurses when examined by work location. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in HCP. Despite these encouraging results, unvaccinated HCP remain at an elevated risk of infection, highlighting the need for targeted outreach to combat vaccine hesitancy.	Prevention

The novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 has emerged at the end of 2019, which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-2019). Recent case reports of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals have revealed the onset of Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms in patients who do not have a family history of the PD.. However, till recently, no genetic impact or mechanisms that may induce Parkinsonism inCOVID-19 patients or after COVID-19 have been found.. This study aimed to detect the commonly dysregulated genes, transcriptional regulators, and pathways between PD and SARS-CoV-2 infections. We integrated genome-wide transcriptomic datasets from PBMC samples from COVID-19 and PD and associated pathways. Our study revealed 81 upregulated and 48 downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared between PD and SARS-CoV-2 infections. These dysregulated genes were involved in key pathways ""mitochondrion structure organization"", ""cell activation in immune response"", and ""signalling by interleukins"". Our analysis showed RELA, TP53 and SP1 TFs that may regulate the upregulated DEGs. We have discovered key dysregulated genes and characterized the biological processes of commonly dysregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infections and PD, which could be used for the design of personalized treatment of PD following COVID-19."

34206230	Can Copper Products and Surfaces Reduce the Spread of Infectious Microorganisms and Hospital-Acquired Infections? Pathogen transfer and infection in the built environment are globally significant events, leading to the spread of disease and an increase in subsequent morbidity and mortality rates. There are numerous strategies followed in healthcare facilities to minimize pathogen transfer, but complete infection control has not, as yet, been achieved. However, based on traditional use in many cultures, the introduction of copper products and surfaces to significantly and positively retard pathogen transmission invites further investigation. For example, many microbes are rendered unviable upon contact exposure to copper or copper alloys, either immediately or within a short time. In addition, many disease-causing bacteria such as E. coli O157:H7, hospital superbugs, and several viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) are also susceptible to exposure to copper surfaces. It is thus suggested that replacing common touch surfaces in healthcare facilities, food industries, and public places (including public transport) with copper or alloys of copper may substantially contribute to limiting transmission. Subsequent hospital admissions and mortality rates will consequently be lowered, with a concomitant saving of lives and considerable levels of resources. This consideration is very significant in times of the COVID-19 pandemic and the upcoming epidemics, as it is becoming clear that all forms of possible infection control measures should be practiced in order to protect community well-being and promote healthy outcomes.

34288707	Assessment of antiviral coatings for high-touch surfaces using human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2. A novel and robust approach to evaluate the antiviral activity of coatings was developed, assessing three commercially available leave-on surface coating products for efficacy against human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2. The assessment is based on three criteria that reflect real-life settings, namely (i) immediate antiviral effect, (ii) effect after repeated cleaning of the coated surface, and (iii) antiviral activity in the presence of organic material. The results showed that only a copper compound-based coating successfully met all three criteria. A quaternary ammonium compound-based coating did not meet the second criterion, and a coating based on reactive oxygen species showed no antiviral effect. Moreover, the study demonstrated that HCoV-229E is a relevant SARS-CoV-2 surrogate for such experiments. This new approach allows to benchmark currently available antiviral coatings and future coating developments to avoid unjustified claims. The deployment of efficient antiviral coatings can offer an additional measure to mitigate the risk of transmission of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 or influenza viruses from high-touch surfaces. Importance SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is transmitted mainly by person-to-person through respiratory droplets whilst the contribution of fomite transmission is less important than suspected at the beginning of the pandemic. Nevertheless, antiviral coating solutions can offer an additional measure to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from high-touch surfaces. The deployment of antiviral coatings is not new, but what is currently lacking is solid scientific evidence of the efficacy of commercially available self-disinfecting surfaces under real-life conditions. Therefore, we developed a novel, robust approach to evaluate the antiviral activity of such coatings, applying strict quality criteria to three commercially available products to test their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. We also showed that HCoV-229E is a relevant surrogate for such experiments. Our approach will bring significant benefit to evaluate the effect of coatings also on the survival of non-enveloped viruses, known to be more tolerant to desiccation and disinfectants and for which high-touch surfaces play an important role.

34214538	Biophysical properties of the isolated spike protein binding helix of human ACE2. The entry of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus in human cells is mediated by the binding of its surface spike protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. A 23-residue long helical segment (SBP1) at the binding interface of human ACE2 interacts with viral spike protein and therefore has generated considerable interest as a recognition element for virus detection. Unfortunately, emerging reports indicate that the affinity of SBP1 to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein is much lower than that of the ACE2 receptor itself. Here, we examine the biophysical properties of SBP1 to reveal factors leading to its low affinity for the spike protein. Whereas SBP1 shows good solubility (solubility > 0.8 mM), circular dichroism spectroscopy shows that it is mostly disordered with some antiparallel beta-sheet content and no helicity. The helicity is substantial (>20%) only upon adding high concentrations (>/=20% v/v) of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, a helix promoter. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and single-molecule photobleaching studies show that the peptide oligomerizes at concentrations >50 nM. We hypothesized that mutating the hydrophobic residues (F28, F32, and F40) of SBP1, which do not directly interact with the spike protein, to alanine would reduce peptide oligomerization without affecting its spike binding affinity. Whereas the mutant peptide (SBP1(mod)) shows substantially reduced oligomerization propensity, it does not show improved helicity. Our study shows that the failure of efforts, so far, to produce a short SBP1 mimic with a high affinity for the spike protein is not only due to the lack of helicity but is also due to the heretofore unrecognized problem of oligomerization.

34341411	The incremental value of computed tomography of COVID-19 pneumonia in predicting ICU admission. Triage is crucial for patient's management and estimation of the required intensive care unit (ICU) beds is fundamental for health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed whether chest computed tomography (CT) of COVID-19 pneumonia has an incremental role in predicting patient's admission to ICU. We performed volumetric and texture analysis of the areas of the affected lung in CT of 115 outpatients with COVID-19 infection presenting to the emergency room with dyspnea and unresponsive hypoxyemia. Admission blood laboratory including lymphocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and C-reactive protein and the ratio between the arterial partial pressure of oxygen and inspired oxygen were collected. By calculating the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC), we compared the performance of blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses features alone and combined with the CT features in two hybrid models (Hybrid radiological and Hybrid radiomics)for predicting ICU admission. Following a machine learning approach, 63 patients were allocated to the training and 52 to the validation set. Twenty-nine (25%) of patients were admitted to ICU. The Hybrid radiological model comprising the lung %consolidation performed significantly (p = 0.04) better in predicting ICU admission in the validation (AUC = 0.82; 95% confidence interval 0.73-0.97) set than the blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses features alone (AUC = 0.71; 95% confidence interval 0.56-0.86). A risk calculator for ICU admission was derived and is available at: https://github.com/cgplab/covidapp . The volume of the consolidated lung in CT of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia has a mild but significant incremental value in predicting ICU admission.	Diagnosis
34220199	Structure and Function of Major SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Proteins. SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, has a genomic organization consisting of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), 4 structural proteins, and 9 accessory proteins. Relative of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, has genomic organization, which is very similar. In this article, the function and structure of the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are described in great detail. The nsps are expressed as a single or two polyproteins, which are then cleaved into individual proteins using two proteases of the virus, a chymotrypsin-like protease and a papain-like protease. The released proteins serve as centers of virus replication and transcription. Some of these nsps modulate the host's translation and immune systems, while others help the virus evade the host immune system. Some of the nsps help form replication-transcription complex at double-membrane vesicles. Others, including one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and one exonuclease, help in the polymerization of newly synthesized RNA of the virus and help minimize the mutation rate by proofreading. After synthesis of the viral RNA, it gets capped. The capping consists of adding GMP and a methylation mark, called cap 0 and additionally adding a methyl group to the terminal ribose called cap1. Capping is accomplished with the help of a helicase, which also helps remove a phosphate, two methyltransferases, and a scaffolding factor. Among the structural proteins, S protein forms the receptor of the virus, which latches on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor of the host and N protein binds and protects the genomic RNA of the virus. The accessory proteins found in these viruses are small proteins with immune modulatory roles. Besides functions of these proteins, solved X-ray and cryogenic electron microscopy structures related to the function of the proteins along with comparisons to other coronavirus homologs have been described in the article. Finally, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 residues of the proteome during the 2020 pandemic has been described. Some proteins are mutated more often than other proteins, but the significance of these mutation rates is not fully understood.	Mechanism
34203647	Progression and Trends in Virus from Influenza A to COVID-19: An Overview of Recent Studies. Influenza is a highly known contagious viral infection that has been responsible for the death of many people in history with pandemics. These pandemics have been occurring every 10 to 30 years in the last century. The most recent global pandemic prior to COVID-19 was the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. A decade ago, the H1N1 virus caused 12,500 deaths in just 19 months globally. Now, again, the world has been challenged with another pandemic. Since December 2019, the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection was detected in Wuhan. This infection has risen rapidly throughout the world; even the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a worldwide emergency to ensure human health and public safety. This review article aims to discuss important issues relating to COVID-19, including clinical, epidemiological, and pathological features of COVID-19 and recent progress in diagnosis and treatment approaches for the COVID-19 infection. We also highlight key similarities and differences between COVID-19 and influenza A to ensure the theoretical and practical details of COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Treatment
34226852	The Impact of United Kingdom and Malaysia's Inherent Health Systems on Their COVID-19 Responses: A Comparison of Containment Strategies. In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was officially declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Given the novelty of the virus, and hence, lack of official guidance on effective containment strategies, individual countries opted for different containment approaches ranging from herd immunity to strict lockdown. The opposing strategies followed by the United Kingdom and its former colony, Malaysia, stand exemplary for this. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was implemented for testing in both counties. Malaysia acted with strict quarantining rules and infection surveillance. The United Kingdom followed an initially lenient, herd-immunity approach with strict lockdown only enforced weeks later. Although based on the same health-care structure historically, Malaysia developed a more unified health system compared with the United Kingdom. We suggest that this more centralized structure could be one possible explanation for why Malaysia was able to react in a more timely and efficient manner, despite its closer geographic proximity to China. We further explore how the differences in testing and quarantining strategy, as well as political situation and societal compliance could account for the discrepancy in the United Kingdom's versus Malaysia's relative success of COVID-19 containment.

34206633	Comparison of Salt-Related Knowledge and Behaviors Status of WeChat Users between 2019 and 2020. In order to identify the status of salt-related knowledge and behavior of the residents who were active in WeChat software between 2019 and 2020, 10-day salt-related surveys were conducted in 2019 and 2020 based on the WeChat public platform of China Healthy Lifestyle for All Campaign. Distribution and scores of salt-related knowledge, salt reduction behavior and high-salt intake behavior between 2019 and 2020 were compared. Data of 2109 participants in 2019 and 12,732 participants in 2020 were left for analysis. Overall, 88.2% of participants in 2019 had a willingness to reduce the amount of cooking salt in their households, significantly lower than 90.2% in 2020 (p-value < 0.05). In 2019 and 2020, over 80% of the participants knew fine dried noodles contain salt, but less than 30% knew ice cream contains salt. Over 78% of participants chose 5 g or 6 g for the maximum daily salt intake of healthy adults, and about 98% of participants knew that excessive salt intake would increase the risk of hypertension in both years. The percentage of participants who used salt measuring spoons asked restaurants to use less salt, read the sodium content on the nutrition facts table, chose foods with low sodium content and regularly used low-sodium salt, were 36.1%, 45.0%, 44.1%, 40.3% and 35.8% in 2019, and the percentage increased significantly to 46.4%, 49.2%, 50.8%, 47.1% and 43.4% in 2020 (all p-value < 0.05). The percentage of people regularly eating pickled mustard tubers, salted vegetables and sauce foods or using high-salt condiments also increased from 2019 to 2020. The median of salt-related knowledge scores, salt reduction behavior scores and high-salt intake behavior scores were 11, 2, 5 points in 2019, and 10, 3, 5 points in 2020, respectively. Compared to 2019, the salt-related knowledge score was relatively lower, while the salt reduction behavior score and high-salt intake behavior score were relatively higher in 2020. Besides, the score of salt-related knowledge and behaviors differed in different gender, age and hypertension groups. The COVID-19 epidemic may have influenced the salt-related knowledge and behaviors status of WeChat users in China. Promotion and education of salt-related knowledge and online behavior intervention are still needed, particularly for male and hypertension patients in the future.	Prevention
34216125	Is Obesity a Potential Risk factor for Poor Prognosis of COVID-19? BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to cause major mortality and morbidity worldwide even after a year of its emergence. In its early days, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases were noted as poor prognostic factors, while obesity gained attention at a later stage. In the present study, unfavorable clinical outcomes (transfer to the intensive care unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality) were investigated in obese patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study we analyzed patients with positive polymerase chain reaction test in tertiary care hospital between March-May 2020. They were divided into 3 groups according to body mass index (BMI) as normal, overweight, and obese (BMI: 18.5 - 24.99 kg/m(2), 25 - 29.99 kg/m(2), and >/= 30 kg/m(2), respectively). We compared clinical features and laboratory findings of these groups and recorded adverse clinical outcomes. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed for unfavorable outcomes. RESULTS: There were 99 patients (35%), 116 (41%), and 69 patients (24%) in the normal-weight, overweight, and obese group, respectively. Among all patients, 52 (18%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), 30 (11%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and 22 patients (8%) died. Obese patients had minimum 1 more comorbidity than normal BMI patients (73% vs. 50%, P = 0.002), and a longer median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of hospitalization (8 [5 - 12] vs. 6 [5 - 9]) days, P = 0.006). Obese participants had higher concentrations of serum C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin than non-obese patients (P <0.05 in all). In a multivariate analysis, obesity was associated with ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.99, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26 - 7.04, P = 0.012). Moreover, IMV requirement was associated with obesity (aOR: 8.73, 95% CI: 2.44 - 31.20, P = 0.001). Mortality occurred in 16%, 9%, and 1% of the obese group, overweight group, and normal-weight group, respectively (Chi-square trend analysis, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Obesity is a risk factor for adverse outcomes and caused increased mortality, hence requiring close follow-up.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34209143	A History of Heart Failure Is an Independent Risk Factor for Death in Patients Admitted with Coronavirus 19 Disease. AIMS: The association between cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease and hypertension, and worse outcomes in COVID-19 patients has been previously demonstrated. However, the effect of a prior diagnosis of heart failure (HF) with reduced or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction on COVID-19 outcomes has not yet been established. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively studied all adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to our institution from March 1st to 2nd May 2020. Patients were grouped based on the presence or absence of HF. We used competing events survival models to examine the association between HF and death, need for intubation, or need for dialysis during hospitalization. Of 4043 patients admitted with COVID-19, 335 patients (8.3%) had a prior diagnosis of HF. Patients with HF were older, had lower body mass index, and a significantly higher burden of co-morbidities compared to patients without HF, yet the two groups presented to the hospital with similar clinical severity and similar markers of systemic inflammation. Patients with HF had a higher cumulative in-hospital mortality compared to patients without HF (49.0% vs. 27.2%, p < 0.001) that remained statistically significant (HR = 1.383, p = 0.001) after adjustment for age, body mass index, and comorbidities, as well as after propensity score matching (HR = 1.528, p = 0.001). Notably, no differences in mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, or renal replacement therapy were observed among HF patients with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of HF is a risk factor of death, substantially increasing in-hospital mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34226169	Endoscopic endonasal surgery during COVID-19 pandemic: Management guideline. Current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic is challenging medical and surgical activities. Specifically, within neurosurgery, endoscopic endonasal approaches pose a high risk of contagion for healthcare personnel involved in it. Initially, the recommendation was to avoid such surgeries. However, the pandemic has dragged on and new solutions must be proposed to continue carrying out these approaches safely. Given the lack of established protocols, we propose the following one, which concisely establishes the measures to be taken in both urgent and scheduled surgery. In addition, a new protection-aspiration device (Maskpirator) is described.	Prevention

Accumulating evidence exists that COVID-19 vaccines might induce or exacerbate autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Currently available COVID-19 vaccines include messenger-RNA (mRNA) and recombinant adenoviral (AdV) vector vaccines, both encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein production as the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. We herein report a case of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) following mRNA vaccination with BNT162b2, and summarize the current literature on cutaneous lupus erythematosus occurring after COVID-19 vaccination.

34211527	Venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 is a potentially serious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that involves an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Its pathophysiology is apparently related to an exacerbated inflammatory process and coagulopathy, verified by an increase in D-dimer, fibrinogen, and fibrin degradation products. Occurrence must be monitored, prevented, and treated according to existing recommendations and guidelines. The increased risk of thrombosis, and the association between this phenomenon and the most severe forms of the disease and death have prompted some groups to propose a more aggressive prophylactic and therapeutic approach. However, the risk-benefit profile of this type of conduct has not been defined and cases must be assessed individually, with a multidisciplinary approach. In this study, we review the main studies and evidence available to date on diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34222164	A Citywide 'Virus Testing': Chinese Government's Response to Preventing and Controlling the Second Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is a daunting challenge globally. China, as well as a handful of other countries, has, for the most part, contained it by implementing strict policies. Wuhan's citywide virus-testing program presents a way forward in preventing and controlling the uncertainty, anxiety, instability and complexity it faces over the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Inarguably, the health crisis requires time-tested strategies and tactics for coordinating governments' and social entities' response to the health crisis, with a goal toward having and ensuring sustained effectiveness. Because of a possible recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, the Prevention and Control Headquarters of Wuhan on COVID-19 launched a massive virus testing of Wuhan's 11 million residents; it was completed within 10 days. In light of this unprecedented mass testing, this study applies the situational crisis communication theory to analyze this massive virus-testing process and the mechanisms involved to contain SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. While many countries still have partial lockdowns, the second outbreak in Wuhan was an indication of what awaited all SARS-CoV-2-stricken countries post-lockdowns and after community restrictions had been lifted. Therefore, the recently implemented Wuhan control mechanism (in cities, districts and townships) may become a hortatory guide to other world regions as they contend with and consider appropriate measures to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to ensure public safety.

34216835	AI-based language models powering drug discovery and development. The discovery and development of new medicines is expensive, time-consuming, and often inefficient, with many failures along the way. Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), language models (LMs) have changed the landscape of natural language processing (NLP), offering possibilities to transform treatment development more effectively. Here, we summarize advances in AI-powered LMs and their potential to aid drug discovery and development. We highlight opportunities for AI-powered LMs in target identification, clinical design, regulatory decision-making, and pharmacovigilance. We specifically emphasize the potential role of AI-powered LMs for developing new treatments for Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) strategies, including drug repurposing, which can be extrapolated to other infectious diseases that have the potential to cause pandemics. Finally, we set out the remaining challenges and propose possible solutions for improvement.	Treatment
34205134	Prevalence, Persistence, and Factors Associated with SARS-CoV-2 IgG Seropositivity in a Large Cohort of Healthcare Workers in a Tertiary Care University Hospital in Northern Italy. This observational study evaluated SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence and related clinical, demographic, and occupational factors among workers at the largest tertiary care University-Hospital of Northwestern Italy and the University of Turin after the first pandemic wave of March-April 2020. Overall, about 10,000 individuals were tested; seropositive subjects were retested after 5 months to evaluate antibodies waning. Among 8769 hospital workers, seroprevalence was 7.6%, without significant differences related to job profile; among 1185 University workers, 3.3%. Self-reporting of COVID-19 suspected symptoms was significantly associated with positivity (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.07, 95%CI: 1.76-2.44), although 27% of seropositive subjects reported no previous symptom. At multivariable analysis, contacts at work resulted in an increased risk of 69%, or 24% for working in a COVID ward; contacts in the household evidenced the highest risk, up to more than five-fold (OR 5.31, 95%CI: 4.12-6.85). Compared to never smokers, being active smokers was inversely associated with seroprevalence (OR 0.60, 95%CI: 0.48-0.76). After 5 months, 85% of previously positive subjects still tested positive. The frequency of SARS-COV-2 infection among Health Care Workers was comparable with that observed in surveys performed in Northern Italy and Europe after the first pandemic wave. This study confirms that infection frequently occurred as asymptomatic and underlines the importance of household exposure, seroprevalence (OR 0.60, 95%CI: 0.48-0.76).	Diagnosis;Prevention
34289385	An intranasal vaccine durably protects against SARS-CoV-2 variants in mice. SARS-CoV-2 variants that attenuate antibody neutralization could jeopardize vaccine efficacy. We recently reported the protective activity of an intranasally administered spike protein-based chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in animals, which has advanced to human trials. Here, we assessed its durability, dose response, and cross-protective activity in mice. A single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induced durably high neutralizing and Fc effector antibody responses in serum and S-specific IgG and IgA secreting long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow. Protection against a historical SARS-CoV-2 strain was observed across a 100-fold vaccine dose range and over a 200-day period. At 6 weeks or 9 months after vaccination, serum antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 strains with B.1.351, B.1.1.28, and B.1.617.1 spike proteins and conferred almost complete protection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts after challenge with variant viruses. Thus, in mice, intranasal immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S provides durable protection against historical and emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains.	Mechanism;Treatment
34365783	THE RADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS OF COVID-19. BACKGROUND/AIM: Available information on the radiological findings of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is constantly updated. Ground glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with bilateral and peripheral distribution have been reported as the most common CT findings, but less typical features can also be identified. According to the reported studies, SARS-CoV-2 infection is not limited to the respiratory system, and it can also affect other organs. Renal dysfunction, gastrointestinal complications, liver dysfunction, cardiac manifestations, and neurological abnormalities are among the reported extrapulmonary features. This review aims to provide updated information for radiologists and all clinicians to better understand the radiological manifestations of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiological findings observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infections were explored in detail in PubMed and Google Scholar databases. RESULTS: The typical pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia were determined as GGOs and accompanying consolidations that primarily involve the periphery of the bilateral lower lobes. The most common extrapulmonary findings were increased resistance to flow in the kidneys, thickening of vascular walls, fatty liver, pancreas, and heart inflammation findings. However, these findings were not specific and significantly overlapped those caused by other viral diseases, and therefore alternative diagnoses should be considered in patients with negative diagnostic tests. CONCLUSION: Radiological imaging plays a supportive role in the care of patients with COVID-19. Both clinicians and radiologists need to know associated pulmonary and extrapulmonary findings and imaging features to help diagnose and manage the possible complications of the disease at an early stage. They should also be familiar with CT findings in patients with COVID-19 since the disease can be incidentally detected during imaging performed with other indications.	Diagnosis
34340771	A systems biology approach to COVID-19 progression in population. A number of models in mathematical epidemiology have been developed to account for control measures such as vaccination or quarantine. However, COVID-19 has brought unprecedented social distancing measures, with a challenge on how to include these in a manner that can explain the data but avoid overfitting in parameter inference. We here develop a simple time-dependent model, where social distancing effects are introduced analogous to coarse-grained models of gene expression control in systems biology. We apply our approach to understand drastic differences in COVID-19 infection and fatality counts, observed between Hubei (Wuhan) and other Mainland China provinces. We find that these unintuitive data may be explained through an interplay of differences in transmissibility, effective protection, and detection efficiencies between Hubei and other provinces. More generally, our results demonstrate that regional differences may drastically shape infection outbursts. The obtained results demonstrate the applicability of our developed method to extract key infection parameters directly from publically available data so that it can be globally applied to outbreaks of COVID-19 in a number of countries. Overall, we show that applications of uncommon strategies, such as methods and approaches from molecular systems biology research to mathematical epidemiology, may significantly advance our understanding of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.

34204014	Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers Withdrawal Is Associated with Higher Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19. Our main aim was to describe the effect on the severity of ACEI (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) and ARB (angiotensin II receptor blocker) during COVID-19 hospitalization. A retrospective, observational, multicenter study evaluating hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with ACEI/ARB. The primary endpoint was the incidence of the composite outcome of prognosis (IMV (invasive mechanical ventilation), NIMV (non-invasive mechanical ventilation), ICU admission (intensive care unit), and/or all-cause mortality). We evaluated both outcomes in patients whose treatment with ACEI/ARB was continued or withdrawn. Between February and June 2020, 11,205 patients were included, mean age 67 years (SD = 16.3) and 43.1% female; 2162 patients received ACEI/ARB treatment. ACEI/ARB treatment showed lower all-cause mortality (p < 0.0001). Hypertensive patients in the ACEI/ARB group had better results in IMV, ICU admission, and the composite outcome of prognosis (p < 0.0001 for all). No differences were found in the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events. Patients previously treated with ACEI/ARB continuing treatment during hospitalization had a lower incidence of the composite outcome of prognosis than those whose treatment was withdrawn (RR 0.67, 95%CI 0.63-0.76). ARB was associated with better survival than ACEI (HR 0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.96). ACEI/ARB treatment during COVID-19 hospitalization was associated with protection on mortality. The benefits were greater in hypertensive, those who continued treatment, and those taking ARB.	Mechanism;Treatment
34291944	"ACE2 Receptor-Modified Algae-Based Microrobot for Removal of SARS-CoV-2 in Wastewater. The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can survive in wastewater for several days with a potential risk of waterborne human transmission, hence posing challenges in containing the virus and reducing its spread. Herein, we report on an active biohybrid microrobot system that offers highly efficient capture and removal of target virus from various aquatic media. The algae-based microrobot is fabricated by using click chemistry to functionalize microalgae with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The resulting ACE2-algae-robot displays fast (>100 mum/s) and long-lasting (>24 h) self-propulsion in diverse aquatic media including drinking water and river water, obviating the need for external fuels. Such movement of the ACE2-algae-robot offers effective ""on-the-fly"" removal of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Specifically, the active biohybrid microrobot results in 95% removal of viral spike protein and 89% removal of pseudovirus, significantly exceeding the control groups such as static ACE2-algae and bare algae. These results suggest considerable promise of biologically functionalized algae toward the removal of viruses and other environmental threats from wastewater."	Mechanism
34207821	Musculoskeletal Changes in Hemophilia Patients Subsequent to COVID-19 Lockdown. (1) Background. The lockdown period due to the COVID-19 pandemic has drastically decreased levels of physical activity in the population. Hemophilia is characterized by hemarthrosis that leads to chronic, progressive and degenerative joint deterioration. (2) Methods. This observational study recruited 27 patients with hemophilia and arthropathy. Knee, ankle and elbow joints were assessed. The frequency of clinical hemarthrosis, pain intensity, pressure pain threshold, and joint ROM were evaluated. (3) Results. Following lockdown, a significant deterioration of joint condition, perceived joint pain and range of motion was noted in all joints. There were no changes in the frequency of knee hemarthrosis, while the frequency of ankle hemarthrosis significantly reduced. However, the frequency of elbow hemarthrosis increased. Depending on the degree of hemophilia severity, there were changes in pressure pain threshold in the elbow and in pain intensity and range of motion of the ankle joint. According to the type of treatment, i.e., prophylaxis vs. on-demand treatment, there were differences in the joint condition in elbows and the plantar flexion movement of the ankle. There were no differences in the knee joint based on the severity of the disease, the type of treatment or the development of inhibitors (4). Conclusions. Because of the COVID-19 lockdown, the musculoskeletal status of patients with hemophilia deteriorated. Joint condition, perceived pain, and range of motion were significantly affected. The frequency of clinical hemarthrosis did not increase during this period. A more active therapeutic model could prevent rapid deterioration in patients with hemophilic arthropathy during prolonged sedentary periods.	Prevention

The aim of the studies is to show that graphical bioinformatics methods are good tools for the description of genome sequences of viruses. A new approach to the identification of unknown virus strains is proposed. METHODS: Biological sequences have been represented graphically through 2D and 3D-Dynamic Representations of DNA/RNA Sequences - theoretical methods for the graphical representation of the sequences developed by us earlier. In these approaches, some ideas of the classical dynamics have been introduced to bioinformatics. The sequences are represented by sets of material points in 2D or 3D spaces. The distribution of the points in space is characteristic of the sequence. The numerical parameters (descriptors) characterizing the sequences correspond to the quantities typical for classical dynamics. RESULTS: Some applications of the theoretical methods have been reviewed briefly. 2D-dynamic graphs representing the complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are shown. CONCLUSION: It is proved that the 3D-Dynamic Representation of DNA/RNA Sequences, coupled with the random forest algorithm, classifies successfully the subtypes of influenza A virus strains.

34207152	"Viral Bad News Sent by EVAIL. This article reviews the current knowledge on how viruses may utilize Extracellular Vesicle Assisted Inflammatory Load (EVAIL) to exert pathologic activities. Viruses are classically considered to exert their pathologic actions through acute or chronic infection followed by the host response. This host response causes the release of cytokines leading to vascular endothelial cell dysfunction and cardiovascular complications. However, viruses may employ an alternative pathway to soluble cytokine-induced pathologies-by initiating the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. The best-understood example of this alternative pathway is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-elicited EVs and their propensity to harm vascular endothelial cells. Specifically, an HIV-encoded accessory protein called the ""negative factor"" (Nef) was demonstrated in EVs from the body fluids of HIV patients on successful combined antiretroviral therapy (ART); it was also demonstrated to be sufficient in inducing endothelial and cardiovascular dysfunction. This review will highlight HIV-Nef as an example of how HIV can produce EVs loaded with proinflammatory cargo to disseminate cardiovascular pathologies. It will further discuss whether EV production can explain SARS-CoV-2-mediated pulmonary and cardiovascular pathologies."	Mechanism;Treatment
34218517	Public health adherence and information-seeking for people with chronic conditions during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. INTRODUCTION: People with chronic conditions, common among rehabilitation populations, may have risk factors that put them at higher risk for more severe illness due to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare adherence to public health guidelines, willingness to adhere to public health guidelines (including vaccination), information-seeking, and perceived trustworthiness of information among people with and without chronic conditions during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: National cross-sectional online survey of people with and without chronic health conditions conducted from April through May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Survey respondents were people with and without chronic conditions, >18 years old, able to read English, and in the U.S. since January 2020. In total, 3,109 survey responses were received and 2,572 complete unique responses were used in analysis. METHODS: The survey assessed demographics, adherence to public health measures, information-seeking, and perceived trustworthiness of information sources. Descriptive analyses characterized the sample, and t-tests and nonparametric tests were used to compare those with and without a chronic condition on the public health measures. RESULTS: Participants with a chronic condition reported high adherence to public health recommendations and high willingness to adhere to anticipated recommendations across a wide range of chronic conditions and similar to those without a chronic condition despite advised caution for people with underlying health conditions. 70.8% of those with a chronic condition reported a willingness to be vaccinated. Participants reported accessing information from varied sources, with perceived trust highest for the healthcare providers and lowest for social media. CONCLUSION: Participants reported high adherence to public health measures, regardless of chronic condition status, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge of adherence to public health measures, information-seeking, and trust in information can assist rehabilitation providers and organizations seeking to mitigate disease transmission, particularly for those with chronic conditions.

34202276	Development of SARS-CoV-2 Specific IgG and Virus-Neutralizing Antibodies after Infection with Variants of Concern or Vaccination. The humoral immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination was examined. Convalescent sera after infection with variants of concern (VOCs: B.1.1.7, n = 10; B.1.351, n = 1) and sera from 100 vaccinees (Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b2, n = 33; Moderna, mRNA-1273, n = 11; AstraZeneca, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222, n = 56) were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed against the viral spike (S)-protein, its receptor-binding domain (RBD), the nucleoprotein (N) and for virus-neutralizing antibodies (VNA). For the latter, surrogate assays (sVNT) and a Vero-cell based neutralization test (cVNT) were used. Maturity of IgG was determined by measuring the avidity in an immunoblot (IB). Past VOC infection resulted in a broad reactivity of anti-S IgG (100%), anti-RBD IgG (100%), and anti-N IgG (91%), while latter were absent in 99% of vaccinees. Starting approximately two weeks after the first vaccine dose, anti-S IgG (75-100%) and particularly anti-RBD IgG (98-100%) were detectable. After the second dose, their titers increased and were higher than in the convalescents. The sVNT showed evidence of VNA in 91% of convalescents and in 80-100%/100% after first/second vaccine dose, respectively. After the second dose, an increase in VNA titer and IgGs of high avidity were demonstrated by cVNT and IB, respectively. Re-vaccination contributes to a more robust immune response.

34226470	Socio-demographic Profile of COVID-19 Patients and Difficulties Faced by Them while Testing RT-PCR: A Multi-center Cross-sectional Study. This study was aimed to find out the socio-demographic profiles as well as difficulties of Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing faced by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. This cross-sectional study was conducted from 10th August to 7th September 2020. Data were collected by telephone interview using a pre-designed questionnaire after taking verbal consent from the participants. Out of 281 COVID-19 patients, 279 were diagnosed by RT-PCR; 10.3% were asymptomatic. Off them 67.6%were males, 24% were hospital staffs. Majority (66.2%) were from the non-city corporation area. History of recent contact with known COVID-19 patients was present in 56.9% cases. Fever (78.3%) and cough (58%) were the most common symptoms. One third of the patients faced difficulty to test RT-PCR for COVID-19. Sixteen percent patients complained of difficulty of getting serial for testing, the maximum waiting time was one week before giving samples. Thirty patients (10.8%) had to wait longer than usual time after reaching the center before giving sample. Hospital staffs were unable to co-operate in 2.5% of the patients while difficulty of managing transport to the hospital for suspected COVID-19 patient was an issue in 2.2% of the patients. Though testing was more difficult in city corporation areas (p=0.028), delay of getting test result was less (p<0.001). Maximum delay of getting test result was 10 days. Finding out the difficulties of COVID-19 testing will help to point out the issues behind these and will help to take necessary steps to tackle this matter. Testing rate can be increased to contain this highly contagious virus in this densely populated country.	Prevention
34372603	An Appraisal of the Current Scenario in Vaccine Research for COVID-19. The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has drawn global attention, affecting millions, disrupting economies and healthcare modalities. With its high infection rate, COVID-19 has caused a colossal health crisis worldwide. While information on the comprehensive nature of this infectious agent, SARS-CoV-2, still remains obscure, ongoing genomic studies have been successful in identifying its genomic sequence and the presenting antigen. These may serve as promising, potential therapeutic targets in the effective management of COVID-19. In an attempt to establish herd immunity, massive efforts have been directed and driven toward developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. This review, in this direction, is aimed at providing the current scenario and future perspectives in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.	Mechanism;Treatment
34348019	COVID-19 Infection: Targeting Possibilities for Treatment. The outbreak of novel coronavirus (nCoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has posed an international public health emergency worldwide and forced people to be confined in their homes. This virus is of high-risk category and is declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The worldwide researchers and various health professionals are working together to determine the best way to stop its spread or halt this virus's spread and circumvent this pandemic condition threatening millions of human lives. The absence of definitive treatment is possible to explore to reduce virus infection and enhance patient recovery. Along with off-label medicines, plasma therapy, vaccines, the researchers exploit the various plants/herbs and their constituents to effectively treat nCoV infection. The present study aimed to present brief and most informative salient features of the numerous facts regarding the SARS-CoV-2, including the structure, genomic sequence, recent mutation, targeting possibility, and various hurdles in research progress, and off-labeled drugs, convalescent plasma therapy, vaccine and plants/herbs for the treatment of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Results showed that off-labeled drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, antiviral drug (remdesivir, favipiravir), etc., give positive results and approved for use or approved for restricted use in some countries like India. Future research should focus on these possibilities that may allow the development of an effective treatment for COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34205714	The Effect of Ambient Environmental Conditions on COVID-19 Mortality: A Systematic Review. Weather conditions may have an impact on SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission, as has been shown for seasonal influenza. Virus transmission most likely favors low temperature and low humidity conditions. This systematic review aimed to collect evidence on the impact of temperature and humidity on COVID-19 mortality. This review was registered with PROSPERO (registration no. CRD42020196055). We searched the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane COVID-19 databases for observational epidemiological studies. Two independent reviewers screened the title/abstracts and full texts of the studies. Two reviewers also performed data extraction and quality assessment. From 5051 identified studies, 11 were included in the review. Although the results were inconsistent, most studies imply that a decrease in temperature and humidity contributes to an increase in mortality. To establish the association with greater certainty, future studies should consider accurate exposure measurements and important covariates, such as government lockdowns and population density, sufficient lag times, and non-linear associations.

34208888	Effects of Delayed Radical Prostatectomy and Active Surveillance on Localised Prostate Cancer-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. External factors, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can lead to cancellations and backlogs of cancer surgeries. The effects of these delays are unclear. This study summarised the evidence surrounding expectant management, delay radical prostatectomy (RP), and neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT) compared to immediate RP. MEDLINE and EMBASE was searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled studies pertaining to the review question. Risks of biases (RoB) were evaluated using the RoB 2.0 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A total of 57 studies were included. Meta-analysis of four RCTs found overall survival and cancer-specific survival were significantly worsened amongst intermediate-risk patients undergoing active monitoring, observation, or watchful waiting but not in low- and high-risk patients. Evidence from 33 observational studies comparing delayed RP and immediate RP is contradictory. However, conservative estimates of delays over 5 months, 4 months, and 30 days for low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk patients, respectively, have been associated with significantly worse pathological and oncological outcomes in individual studies. In 11 RCTs, a 3-month course of NHT has been shown to improve pathological outcomes in most patients, but its effect on oncological outcomes is apparently limited.	Prevention
34221853	Preventing COVID-19 in assisted living facilities: An impossible task pending vaccination roll out. Here, we aimed to describe the clinical outcomes of the residents of a long-term care facility during its closure to visitors and suppliers in response to the first COVID-19 pandemic from February 23 to June 22, 2020, and the results of the facility-wide SARS-CoV-2 testing of residents and staff in June 2020 before its partially reopening. Seventy-four residents and 53 members of staff were included in the present study. The staff underwent nasopharyngeal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2, and both the staff and residents underwent serological tests to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The results of all of the tests were negative. Conversely, 94% of residents and 38% members of the staff were tested positive to the nasopharyngeal swab tests during the second COVID-19 pandemic wave (data collected from November 1 to November 30, 2020). Our experience suggests that, in the presence of a life-threatening pandemic such as SARS-CoV-2 infection, the prompt use of restrictive procedures can prevent the spread and progression of disease in assisted living facilities in the short term but may fail in the long term, especially when the prevalence of the COVID-19 greatly increased outside the facility enhancing the risk of import the disease from outside. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of residents and staff members would contribute to control/limit the prevalence and the spread of the virus.	Prevention
34215764	Mobility restrictions were associated with reductions in COVID-19 incidence early in the pandemic: evidence from a real-time evaluation in 34 countries. Most countries have implemented restrictions on mobility to prevent the spread of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), entailing considerable societal costs but, at least initially, based on limited evidence of effectiveness. We asked whether mobility restrictions were associated with changes in the occurrence of COVID-19 in 34 OECD countries plus Singapore and Taiwan. Our data sources were the Google Global Mobility Data Source, which reports different types of mobility, and COVID-19 cases retrieved from the dataset curated by Our World in Data. Beginning at each country's 100th case, and incorporating a 14-day lag to account for the delay between exposure and illness, we examined the association between changes in mobility (with January 3 to February 6, 2020 as baseline) and the ratio of the number of newly confirmed cases on a given day to the total number of cases over the past 14 days from the index day (the potentially infective 'pool' in that population), per million population, using LOESS regression and logit regression. In two-thirds of examined countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility (to workplaces, transit stations, retailers, and recreation) were associated with decreased cases, especially early in the pandemic. Once both mobility and incidence had been brought down, further restrictions provided little additional benefit. These findings point to the importance of acting early and decisively in a pandemic.

34343282	Improving Pandemic Response: Employing Mathematical Modeling to Confront COVID-19. Modeling complements surveillance data to inform COVID-19 public health decision making and policy development. This includes the use of modeling to improve situational awareness, to assess epidemiological characteristics, and to inform the evidence base for prevention strategies. To enhance modeling utility in future public health emergencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched the Infectious Disease Modeling and Analytics Initiative. The initiative objectives are to: (1) strengthen leadership in infectious disease modeling, epidemic forecasting, and advanced analytic work; (2) build and cultivate a community of skilled modeling and analytics practitioners and consumers across CDC; (3) strengthen and support internal and external applied modeling and analytic work; and, (4) working with partners, coordinate government-wide advanced data modeling and analytics for infectious diseases. These efforts are critical to help prepare CDC, the country, and the world to respond effectively to present and future infectious disease threats.	Prevention

34206312	Early Onset of SARS-COV-2 Antibodies after First Dose of BNT162b2: Correlation with Age, Gender and BMI. BACKGROUND: The first goal of the study was to analyse the antibody titre 21 days after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine in a group of 252 healthcare workers (HCW). The second goal was to analyse how the antibody titre changes in correlation with age, gender and body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Participants had a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and were assessed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline and 21 days after the BNT162b2 priming dose. RESULTS: First dose of BNT162b2 activated immune responses in 98% of the participants. Five HWC had no increase in antibody titre 21 days after the first dose. Antibody titre was greater in young (<38 years) vs. older participants (<38 vs. 47-56 p = 0.002; <38 vs. >56 p = 0.001). Higher antibody levels were detected in underweight vs. pre-obesity group (p = 0.026) and in normal-weight vs. pre-obesity group (p = 0.007). This association was confirmed after adjusting for age (p = 0.0001) and gender (p = 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that a single dose of BNT162b2 activates the immune response, and being young and normal-weight correlate positively with this response. Larger specifically designed clinical trials are needed to validate these results.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34206293	Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients Affected by Non-Communicable Diseases in Europe and in the USA. An international online patient community, Carenity, conducted a patient study in two independent waves among adults affected by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Europe and in the United States of America (USA). The study aimed to assess the real time impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the medical conditions of patients with NCDs, their access to health care, and their adaptation to daily life as well as to describe their sources of information on COVID-19 and their needs for specific information and support. During the pandemic, 50% of the patients reported a worsening of their medical condition, and 17% developed a new disease. Additionally, 26% of the respondents reported an impact of the pandemic on regular/long-term treatment intake. 54% of the patients felt very or completely socially isolated and reported a strong impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their stress level and state of mind, with higher levels observed in the USA compared to Europe. 59% of the respondents wished to have received additional information regarding the risks associated to their medical condition during the pandemic. Television was the most used source of information, whereas physicians were the most trusted one. This study describes the substantial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on NCD patients.	Prevention
34376927	Responses to COVID-19 in South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries in 2020, a data analysis during a world of crises. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was notified from Wuhan city, Hubei province, China in the mid of December 2019. The disease is showing dynamic change in the pattern of COVID-19 confirmed cases and death toll in these low and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this study, exponential growth (EG) method was used to calculate the reproductive rate (Rt) for initial and current stage of epidemic in South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) member countries (April 2020 - December 2020). Time dependent (TD) method was used to calculate the weekly reproduction number. We also presented the observations on COVID-19 epidemiology in relation with the health expenditure, poverty, and BCG vaccination, literacy, in comparison with the reproduction number, population density for understanding the current scenario, trends, and expected outcome of the disease in SAARC countries. A significant positive correlation was noticed between COVID-19 deaths and health expenditure (% GDP) (r=0.58, P<0.05). The other factors such as population density/ sq km, literacy %, adult population %, and poverty % are not significantly correlated with number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Among SAARC countries, the highest reproduction number (Rt) was observed in India (Rt =2.10; 95% CI 2.04-2.17) followed by Bangladesh (Rt =1.62; 95% CI 1.59-1.64) in initial state of epidemic. A continuous monitoring is necessitated in all countries looking at the medical facilities, available infrastructure and healthcare manpower, constraints which may appear with increased number of critically ill patients if the situation persists longer.

34217301	Transmission frequency of COVID-19 through pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in AJK: a report of 201 cases. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a catastrophic global phenomenon, affecting human life in a way unseen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Effective management of this threat requires halting transmission, a strategy requiring accurate knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns. METHODS: This was a retrospective contact study aiming to estimate the transmission rate of COVID-19 by tracing contacts in symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and asymptomatic patients. History of patients' contacts during 24 h before appearance of symptoms or infection confirmation was traced for disease transmission. RESULTS: Overall, a total of 201 COVID-19 patients had contact with 7168 people in 24 h with an average of 35.66 contacts per patient, ranging from a minimum of 4 to maximum of 87 contacts (meetings). Out of 7168 persons met, infection was detected in 64 (0.89%). For the 155 symptomatic patients, a total of 5611 contacted persons were traced before appearance of symptoms (pre-symptomatic) in last 24 h with an average of 36.20 meetings per patient. The infection was transmitted in 63 (1.12%) people with 5548 (98.88%) remaining uninfected. Out of the 63 transmissions, 62 (98.4%) were traced within 6 h before symptom onset, while only 1 was identified in the 6-12 h timeframe before symptoms. A total of 1557 persons were traced having meeting/contacts with asymptomatic cases in last 24 h before infection confirmation. Out of these 1557 persons, only 1 was found to be infected and the infection rate was calculated to be 0.06%. Statistically, the transmission rate by pre-symptomatic patients was found to be significantly higher than the transmission rate by asymptomatic individuals (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In the studied population, the risk of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 was low, with transmission risks of 1.12% and 0.06% respectively. Pre-symptomatic infection becomes very rare in contacts made longer than 6 h before onset of symptoms. The infection transmission is traced as long as about 9 h before the appearance of clear symptoms in the patients, but the incidence rate was as low as about 0.02% of the total contacts in that period.

34351606	Delayed Cutaneous Hypersensitivity Reaction to Vaxzevria (ChAdOx1-S) Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Recently, an increasing number of cases with delayed cutaneous reaction after immunization with mRNA-based vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported. This adverse reaction, which is considered a delayed-type or T cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, has been described for the Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b2) vaccines. We describe a delayed large local cutaneous reaction in a patient who received the viral vector vaccine Vaxzevria (ChAdOx1-S, AstraZeneca). The time course and clinical symptoms of delayed skin reaction after mRNA vaccines have a similar pattern that we recognized in our patient after Vaxzevria vaccination. This phenomenon has not been described in the Vaxzevria clinical trials and is to our knowledge the first report of this adverse reaction to a vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. With this, we hope to raise awareness about delayed injection site reactions that also occur after viral vector vaccines and to encourage additional reporting and patient education regarding the cutaneous reactions after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination.

34228514	In-Transit Migrants And Asylum Seekers: Inclusion Gaps In Mexico's COVID-19 Health Policy Response. During the COVID-19 pandemic, as immigration and asylum processes were delayed or interrupted, migrants and asylum seekers were stranded at Mexico's northern border. In-transit migrants and asylum seekers are an underserved population, and pandemic preparedness has seldom taken their needs into account. In this article we analyze public health policies developed in Mexico in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and describe how these policies have largely overlooked the needs of vulnerable mobile populations. We reviewed eighty publicly available documents issued by federal, state, and municipal authorities in Mexico between January and September 2020. Only seven policy documents explicitly considered in-transit migrants and asylum seekers and their health care needs. In addition, we identified six major gaps in these policies that, if addressed, would promote greater inclusion of persons in mobility in future pandemic response plans, to protect the health of migrant populations.

34284037	Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease and Cirrhosis: A National COVID Cohort Collaborative Study. BACKGROUND & AIMS: In patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) with or without cirrhosis, existing studies on the outcomes with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have limited generalizability. We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a harmonized electronic health record dataset of 6.4 million, to describe SARS-CoV-2 outcomes in patients with CLD and cirrhosis. METHODS: We identified all patients with CLD with or without cirrhosis who had SARS-CoV-2 testing in the N3C Data Enclave as of July 1, 2021. We used survival analyses to associate SARS-CoV-2 infection, presence of cirrhosis, and clinical factors with the primary outcome of 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We isolated 220,727 patients with CLD and SARS-CoV-2 test status: 128,864 (58%) were noncirrhosis/negative, 29,446 (13%) were noncirrhosis/positive, 53,476 (24%) were cirrhosis/negative, and 8941 (4%) were cirrhosis/positive patients. Thirty-day all-cause mortality rates were 3.9% in cirrhosis/negative and 8.9% in cirrhosis/positive patients. Compared to cirrhosis/negative patients, cirrhosis/positive patients had 2.38 times adjusted hazard of death at 30 days. Compared to noncirrhosis/positive patients, cirrhosis/positive patients had 3.31 times adjusted hazard of death at 30 days. In stratified analyses among patients with cirrhosis with increased age, obesity, and comorbid conditions (ie, diabetes, heart failure, and pulmonary disease), SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased adjusted hazard of death. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of approximately 221,000 nationally representative, diverse, and gender-balanced patients with CLD; we found SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cirrhosis was associated with 2.38 times mortality hazard, and the presence of cirrhosis among patients with CLD infected with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with 3.31 times mortality hazard. These results provide an additional impetus for increasing vaccination uptake and further research regarding immune responses to vaccines in patients with severe liver disease.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34289328	Changes in olfactory bulbus volume and olfactory sulcus depth in the chronic period after COVID-19 infection. BACKGROUND: Although there are a limited number of studies investigating the changes in olfactory bulb volume (OBV) and olfactory sulcus depth (OSD) values in the acute and subacute periods after COVID-19 infection, there are no studies conducted in the chronic period. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to reveal the changes in OBV and OSD after COVID-19 in the chronic period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 83 people were included in our study, including 42 normal healthy individuals (control group) and 41 patients with COVID-19 infection (10-12 months after infection). RESULTS: The COVID-19 group included 41 patients with the mean age 40.27 +/- 14.5 years and the control group included 42 individuals with the mean age 40.27 +/- 14.4. The mean OBV was 67.97 +/- 14.27 mm(3) in the COVID-19 group and 94.21 +/- 7.56 mm(3) in the control group. The mean OSD was 7.98 +/- 0.37 mm in the COVID-19 group and 8.82 +/- 0.74 mm in the control group. Left, right, and mean OBVs and OSD were significantly lower in patients with COVID- 19 than the control individuals (all p < .05). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that COVID-19 infection causes a significant decrease in the OBV and OSD measurements in the chronic period.	Diagnosis
34199589	Indoor Environmental Quality in Dwellings and Lifestyle Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Russian Perspective. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern, and as a response, public health authorities started enforcing preventive measures like self-isolation and social distancing. The enforcement of isolation has consequences that may affect the lifestyle-related behavior of the general population. Quarantine encompasses a range of strategies that can be used to detain, isolate, or conditionally release individuals or populations infected or exposed to contagious diseases and should be tailored to circumstances. Interestingly, medical students may represent an example of how the COVID-19 pandemic can form new habits and change lifestyle behaviors. We conducted a web-based survey to assess changes in lifestyle-related behavior of self-isolated medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then we analyzed the sanitary-hygienic regulations of the Russian Federation to determine the requirements for healthy buildings. Results showed that during the pandemic, the enforcement of isolation affects medical students' lifestyle-related behavior and accompanies an increase in non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and healthy buildings are cutting-edge factors in preventing COVID-19 and NCDs. The Russian sanitary-hygienic regulations support improving this factor with suitable requirements for ventilation, sewage, waste management, and disinfection. Herein, assessing isolation is possible through the hygienic self-isolation index.	Prevention
34292871	Ongoing global and regional adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the trends in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evolution is paramount to control the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed more than 300,000 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants available as of January 2021. The results show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection, but a small set of sites appear to evolve under positive selection. The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the region of the nucleocapsid protein associated with nuclear localization signals (NLS) are enriched with positively selected amino acid replacements. These replacements form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions and are signatures of major partitions in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. Virus diversity within each geographic region has been steadily growing for the entirety of the pandemic, but analysis of the phylogenetic distances between pairs of regions reveals four distinct periods based on global partitioning of the tree and the emergence of key mutations. The initial period of rapid diversification into region-specific phylogenies that ended in February 2020 was followed by a major extinction event and global homogenization concomitant with the spread of D614G in the spike protein, ending in March 2020. The NLS-associated variants across multiple partitions rose to global prominence in March to July, during a period of stasis in terms of interregional diversity. Finally, beginning in July 2020, multiple mutations, some of which have since been demonstrated to enable antibody evasion, began to emerge associated with ongoing regional diversification, which might be indicative of speciation.

34228265	A retrospective cohort study of risk factors and outcomes in older patients admitted to an inner-city geriatric unit in London during first peak of COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: Compared to younger patients, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical presentation in older people can be more heterogeneous and fatal. We aim to describe a cohort of older adults admitted in an inner-city London hospital during the first peak of the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective observational study that enrolled older adults consecutively admitted into two geriatric wards with suspected or confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We collected socio-demographic data, comorbidities, symptoms at presentation and/or during admission, biochemical and radiological data and outcomes at 28 days. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four patients were included, and 75% were > 80 years old. 19.5% of COVID-19 cases were judged to be hospital-acquired. More than half presented or developed typical symptoms, respiratory failure or fatigue. 46.8% were diagnosed with delirium, 24.2% with falls and dysphagia was present in 13.7%. The mortality rate was 29.8% and was higher among males, those > 80 years, patients with a higher grade of frailty, a history of dementia or chronic kidney disease, as well as those diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute kidney injury or hypernatremia. Independent predictors of mortality were male sex, age > 80 years, respiratory failure and hypernatremia. CONCLUSION: We have described a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first UK peak of the global pandemic. We found that these patients had significant frailty with multiple comorbidities. There was a high mortality and increased dependency and greater social care need in survivors.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34208000	Analysis and Forecasting Incidence, Intensive Care Unit Admissions, and Projected Mortality Attributable to COVID-19 in Portugal, the UK, Germany, Italy, and France: Predictions for 4 Weeks Ahead. The use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is a great contribution to medical studies since the application of forecasting concepts allows for the analysis of future diseases propagation. In this context, this paper presents a study of the new coronavirus SARS-COV-2 with a focus on verifying the virus propagation associated with mitigation procedures and massive vaccination campaigns. There were two proposed methodologies in making predictions 28 days ahead for the number of new cases, deaths, and ICU patients of five European countries: Portugal, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany. A case study of the results of massive immunization in Israel was also considered. The data input of cases, deaths, and daily ICU patients was normalized to reduce discrepant numbers due to the countries' size and the cumulative vaccination values by the percentage of population immunized (with at least one dose of the vaccine). As a comparative criterion, the calculation of the mean absolute error (MAE) of all predictions presents the best methodology, targeting other possibilities of use for the method proposed. The best architecture achieved a general MAE for the 1-to-28-day ahead forecast, which is lower than 30 cases, 0.6 deaths, and 2.5 ICU patients per million people.	Epidemic Forecasting
34283900	Association of diabetes with severity and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective study. Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread worldwide. The aim this study was to investigate the association of diabetes with severity and mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Methods: This retrospective, single-center case study enrolled a total of 564 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, between January 20 and March 15, 2020. Results: Among the 564 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 509 (85.1%) were discharged and 55 (9.8%) died. The median age was 59 years (range, 10-93 years). A total of 85 (15.1%) patients were diagnosed with diabetes on admission (median age, 65.0 [range, 34-91] years). Patients with diabetes had significantly higher proportions of critical cases (24 [28.2%] vs. 66 [13.8%]) and in-hospital mortality (17 [20%] vs. 38 [7.9%]). Moreover, patients with diabetes presented abnormal levels of multiple indicators concerning lymphopenia, inflammation, heart, liver, kidney, and lung function on admission, while diabetic patient group still display higher troponin T (TnT) levels when approaching discharge. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve indicated a trend toward poorer survival in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients, also evidenced by abnormal laboratory biomarker changes regarding multiple system impairments among COVID-19 patients with diabetes with in-hospital death. Conclusion: The detailed clinical investigation of 564 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 indicated a considerable association between diabetes and COVID-19 severity or mortality. Thus, more intensive treatment may be considered for COVID-19 patients with diabetes, especially regarding to cardiac injury.	Diagnosis;Treatment

34219851	A decision analytic approach for social distancing policies during early stages of COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has become a crucial public health problem in the world that disrupted the lives of millions in many countries including the United States. In this study, we present a decision analytic approach which is an efficient tool to assess the effectiveness of early social distancing measures in communities with different population characteristics. First, we empirically estimate the reproduction numbers for two different states. Then, we develop an age-structured compartmental simulation model for the disease spread to demonstrate the variation in the observed outbreak. Finally, we analyze the computational results and show that early trigger social distancing strategies result in smaller death tolls; however, there are relatively larger second waves. Conversely, late trigger social distancing strategies result in higher initial death tolls but relatively smaller second waves. This study shows that decision analytic tools can help policy makers simulate different social distancing scenarios at the early stages of a global outbreak. Policy makers should expect multiple waves of cases as a result of the social distancing policies implemented when there are no vaccines available for mass immunization and appropriate antiviral treatments.

34227875	The Hyperperception Model: When Your Partner's New Friends Inspire Jealousy and Failing to Use Social Distancing. The hyperperception model was used to derive hypotheses concerning the processes by which people experience romantic jealousy because of their observation of their romantic partners on social network sites. The main focus was on the receiver component of the model that specifies that when observation of others' interactions is constrained to social media, those interactions appear more intimate than when the dyad is also observable offline. A survey (N = 322) was conducted to test this component of the model and determine if the model can predict additional phenomena such as possession signals and staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were generally consistent with the hypotheses and the utility of the hyperperception model for understanding the effects of observing romantic partners' interactions on social media. The data also reveal the importance of interpersonal processes in obeying social distancing guidelines.	Prevention
34379705	Rapid generation of mouse model for emerging infectious disease with the case of severe COVID-19. Since the pandemic of COVID-19 has intensely struck human society, small animal model for this infectious disease is in urgent need for basic and pharmaceutical research. Although several COVID-19 animal models have been identified, many of them show either minimal or inadequate pathophysiology after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Here, we describe a new and versatile strategy to rapidly establish a mouse model for emerging infectious diseases in one month by multi-route, multi-serotype transduction with recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors expressing viral receptor. In this study, the proposed approach enables profound and enduring systemic expression of SARS-CoV-2-receptor hACE2 in wild-type mice and renders them vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upon virus challenge, generated AAV/hACE2 mice showed pathophysiology closely mimicking the patients with severe COVID-19. The efficacy of a novel therapeutic antibody cocktail RBD-chAbs for COVID-19 was tested and confirmed by using this AAV/hACE2 mouse model, further demonstrating its successful application in drug development.

34205519	Assessing the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of COVID-19 among Quarantine Hotel Workers in China. During the pandemic, quarantine hotel workers face a higher risk of infection while they host quarantine guests from overseas. This study's aim is to gain an understanding of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of quarantine hotel workers in China. A total of 170 participants took part in a cross-sectional survey to assess the KAP of quarantine hotel workers in China, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The chi-square test, independent t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), descriptive analysis, and binary logistic regression were used to examine the sociodemographic factors associated with KAP levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that 62.41% have good knowledge, 94.7% have a positive attitude towards COVID-19, but only 78.2% have good practices. Most quarantine hotel workers (95.3%) are confident that COVID-19 will be successfully controlled and that China is handling the COVID-19 crisis well (98.8%). Most quarantine hotel workers are also taking personal precautions, such as avoiding crowds (80.6%) and wearing facemasks (97.6%). The results evidence that quarantine hotel workers in China have acquired the necessary knowledge, positive attitudes and proactive practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study can provide a reference for quarantine hotel workers and their targeted education and intervention.	Prevention
34285614	"Determinants of Postponed Cancer Screening During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from the Nationally Representative COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring in Germany (COSMO). Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by various challenges for individual health and the health care system. However, preventive examinations such as cancer screenings should not be postponed during a pandemic. Because nationally representative studies describing postponed cancer screenings and identifying its determinants in Germany are lacking, our aim was to close this gap in knowledge. Materials and Methods: We used cross-sectional data from the nationally representative online-survey ""COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring in Germany (COSMO)"" (wave 17), which was conducted in July 2020. The analytical sample included 974 individuals (mean age was 45.9 years, SD: 16.5 years; 18 to 74 years). The outcome measure was whether cancer screening had been postponed since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic (no, attended as planned; yes, postponed). Results: In total, slightly more than 10% of individuals stated to have postponed cancer screenings between March and July 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly women and individuals aged 30 to 49 years. The likelihood of postponed cancer screening was positively associated with higher affect regarding COVID-19 (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.16-2.35), whereas it was negatively associated with younger age (eg, 18 to 29 years, OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.05-0.64, compared to individuals 30 to 49 years). Conclusion: Study findings showed that one out of ten individuals postponed cancer screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined two correlates of them (age and affect regarding COVID-19). Individuals with an increased likelihood of postponed cancer screenings should be specifically addressed."	Prevention
34223786	Prevalence of COVID-19 in 10,000 samples from 7853 patients in Eastern Turkey by positive real-time PCR. Aim: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, started in December 2019 and has spread across the world. Materials & methods: We analyzed real-time PCR results of 10,000 samples from 2 April to 30 May 2020 in three neighbor cities located in the East of Turkey. The final study population was 7853 cases, after excluding screening tests. Results: Real-time PCR was performed to detect the SARS-CoV-2-specific RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase gene fragment. The number of total positive samples out of 7853 were 487; however, the number of nonrepeating positive patient was 373 (4.8%). Cough and fever were the most common symptoms in positive cases. Conclusion: Epidemiologic studies should be performed about the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection to better understand the effect of the virus across the world.	Diagnosis
34219745	[Therapeutic meals in a psychiatric day hospital for children and sanitary restrictions: Institutional psychotherapy and Covid-19]. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pordegui children's hospital - a day psychiatric centre at Montauban hospital - first closed its doors in March 2019, like many ambulatory care facilities. As a result, the first confinement had a strong impact on the accessibility to care for particularly vulnerable patients. While the lockdown has been eased after a few weeks, the respect of hygiene rules and barrier gestures still impacts the therapeutic framework of the institution.This article aims to document reflections on the effects that the current arrangements, inherent to the pandemic health situation, seem to produce over the organization of care in psychiatric children's hospitals, using the example of therapeutic meals.The latter should not be taken for granted, even though the minimal conditions for this caring time have been reinstated. Such conditions include a repetitive, structuring and reassuring framework with schedules, collective arrangements characterized by the regular presence pattern of the caregivers and their availability, as well as feedback sessions in the form of institutional meetings. After the reopening of the center, specific phenomena that were not so identifiable during the other care times were noticed during the meals of individual and group of patients. A situational analysis was led, based on observations, experience with patients and cross-examination (institutional psychotherapy and phenomenology) in order to understand these movements and highlight what seems to be irreducible for a meal to be therapeutic.

34373830	Telogen Effluvium after SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Series of Cases and Possible Pathogenetic Mechanisms. Introduction: Physicians have largely studied the cutaneous involvement of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but only few reports have focused on telogen effluvium (TE) as a possible sequela of COVID-19. We assessed 14 cases of hair loss occurring after SARS-CoV-2 infection using trichoscopy and trichogram to investigate patterns related to COVID-19. Furthermore, we discussed possible mechanisms involved in COVID-19 TE. Case Presentation: Fourteen individuals were referred to our post-COVID-19 dermatology office complaining acute hair loss after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical evaluation included pull test, trichoscopy, and trichogram. CO-VID-19 TE occurred after a median of 2 months (range 1-3 months) following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median duration of hair loss was 5 months (range 1-6 months). Trichoscopy showed variable but typical TE patterns. Trichogram showed different telogen/anagen ratio depending on the interval between onset of hair loss and trichological visit. Discussion/Conclusion: Our cases showed TE between 1 and 3 months after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus earlier than classic TE. Trichoscopic features and trichogram showed no variations from classic TE. Different pathogenetic mechanisms including pro-inflammatory cytokines and direct viral damage on the hair follicle can be hypothesized; further studies on a larger sample are needed to better understand this condition.

E-health applications can support continuing care for persons with chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). We have developed a web-based mobile app called VIOLA to be used at home by persons with MS (pwMS) who previously participated in an innovative multidisciplinary rehab program. The purpose of VIOLA is to reinforce what participants have learned about a healthy lifestyle and to keep them motivated to adhere to rehabilitation programs. As the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has severely curtailed pwMS contact with their usual health providers, we quickly updated VIOLA to grant continuity of care to our home-bound patients.By monitoring pwMS subscriptions to individual modules, we found a definite increase after the national lockdown was declared. Subscribers rated the app very positively.Encouraged by the positive feedbacks, we are planning to extend the access to our app also to pwMS with no prior specific learning experience. This would limit the psychophysical consequences of the lockdown. Furthermore, VIOLA could be effective in maintaining a proper lifestyle, contributing to improve the quality of life of pwMS.VIOLA has the potential of increasing the adherence of pwMS to the rehabilitation confirming that digital communication tools are a valuable solution for those home-bound.].

34133201	Liquid Chalk Is an Antiseptic against SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A Respiratory Viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and enforced significant restrictions within our societies, including the attendance of public and professional athletes in gyms. Liquid chalk is a commonly used accessory in gyms and is comprised of magnesium carbonate and alcohol that quickly evaporates on the hands to leave a layer of dry chalk. We investigated whether liquid chalk is an antiseptic against highly pathogenic human viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, and noroviruses. Chalk was applied before or after virus, inoculum and recovery of infectious virus was determined to mimic the use in the gym. We observed that addition of chalk before or after virus contact led to a significant reduction in recovery of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus but had little impact on norovirus. These observations suggest that the use and application of liquid chalk can be an effective and suitable antiseptic for major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games. IMPORTANCE To restrict the potential transmission and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the use of liquid chalk has been a requirement in an active gym setting. However, its effectiveness has not been scientifically proven. Here, we show that the application of liquid chalk before or after virus inoculum significantly impacts recovery of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses but not noroviruses. Thus, our study has shown that the implementation and application of liquid chalk in communal social gym settings is effective in reducing the infectivity of respiratory viruses, and this supports the use of liquid chalk in major sporting events to restrict the impact of COVID-19 on our communities.

34355004	Network Analysis of Outpatients to Identify Predictive Symptoms and Combinations of Symptoms Associated With Positive/Negative SARS-CoV-2 Nasopharyngeal Swabs. Background: Limited data exist on early predictive clinical symptoms or combinations of symptoms that could be included in the case definition of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly for mild-to-moderate disease in an outpatient setting. Methods: A cohort study of individuals presenting with clinical symptoms to one of the largest dedicated networks of COVID-19 test centers in Geneva, Switzerland, between March 2 and April 23, 2020. Individuals completed a symptom questionnaire, received a nurse-led check-up, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained. An analysis of clinical features predicting the positivity and negativity of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was performed to determine the relationship between symptoms and their combinations. Results: Of 3,248 patients included (mean age, 42.2 years; 1,504 [46.3%] male), 713 (22%) had a positive RT-PCR; 1,351 (41.6%) consulted within 3 days of symptom onset. The strongest predictor of a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was anosmia, particularly in early disease, followed by fever, myalgia, and cough. Symptoms predictive of a negative test were breathing difficulties, abdominal symptoms, thoracic pain and runny nose. Three distinct networks of symptoms were identified, but did not occur together: respiratory symptoms; systemic symptoms related to fever; and other systemic symptoms related to anosmia. Conclusions: Symptoms and networks of symptoms associated with a positive/negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR are emerging and may help to guide targeted testing. Identification of early COVID-19-related symptoms alone or in combination can contribute to establish a clinical case definition and provide a basis for clinicians and public health authorities to distinguish it from other respiratory viruses early in the course of the disease, particularly in the outpatient setting.

34336881	Regional Differences in Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics, Treatment, and Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Remote Areas of Hubei Province. Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a major threat to global health. Regional differences in epidemiological and clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of patients have not yet been investigated. This study was conducted to investigate these differences amongCOVID-19 patients in Hubei Province, China. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed data on 289 COVID-19 patients from designated hospitals in three regions:Urban (Wuhan Union West Hospital), Suburban areas of Wuhan (Hannan Hospital) and Enshi city, between February 8 and 20, 2020. The final date of follow-up was December 14th, 2020. The outcomes were case fatality rate and epidemiological and clinical data. Results: Urban Wuhan experienced a significantly higher case fatality rate (21.5%) than suburban Wuhan (5.23%) and rural area of Enshi (3.51%). Urban Wuhan had a higher proportion of patients on mechanical ventilation (24.05%) than suburban Wuhan (0%) and rural Enshi (3.57%). Treatment with glucocorticoids was equivalent in urban and suburban Wuhan (46.84 and 45.75%, respectively) and higher than Enshi (25.00%). Urban Wuhan had a higher proportion of patients with abnormal tests including liver function and serum electrolytes and a higher rate of pneumonia (p < 0.01 for all). Urban Wuhan also had a higher incidence of respiratory failure, heart disease, liver disease and shock, compared with the other two regions (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings revealed that there are regional differences in COVID-19. These findings provide novel insights into the distribution of appropriate resources for the prevention, control and treatment of COVID-19 for the global community.	Diagnosis;Prevention;Treatment
34221777	Delayed Presentation During COVID-19 Pandemic Leading to Post-Myocardial Infarction Ventricular Septal Defect. Post-myocardial infarction ventricular septal defect (post-MI VSD) is a rare complication of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with an incidence of <1% in early revascularization era. Here we present the case of a 66-year-old woman with post-MI VSD owing to delay in her presentation in the current pandemic. Patient presented with worsening back pain and chest pain with confusion, and an EKG positive for inferior wall STEMI. She underwent emergent percutaneous intervention with placement of drug-eluting stent in her right coronary artery. She developed worsening heart failure and new-onset heart murmur and was found to have a VSD on a transthoracic echo. Because of her poor prognosis, family decided to pursue comfort care and patient unfortunately passed. Delay in seeking health care during the pandemic, as seen in our patient, is multifactorial including fear of contracting infection, decreased emergency medical services members, and concerns for overburdening healthcare systems. Lack of standardized in-hospital approach to emergencies while ensuring adequate protection from infection to healthcare workers, especially during the initial phase of the pandemic, led to increased door-to-balloon times in addition to the increased time to first medical contact. The importance of media outreach ensuring availability of health care in emergencies, changing emergency response algorithms to ensure safety of patients and healthcare providers, and including thrombolytic therapy where there is a delay due to stringent screening or delayed COVID-19 testing can be used to prevent worsening complications following STEMI.

34200600	Long-Term Exposure to PM2.5, Facemask Mandates, Stay Home Orders and COVID-19 Incidence in the United States. Long-term PM2.5 exposure might predispose populations to SARS-CoV-2 infection and intervention policies might interrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission and reduce the risk of COVID-19. We conducted an ecologic study across the United States, using county-level COVID-19 incidence up to 12 September 2020, to represent the first two surges in the U.S., annual average of PM2.5 between 2000 and 2016 and state-level facemask mandates and stay home orders. We fit negative binomial models to assess COVID-19 incidence in association with PM2.5 and policies. Stratified analyses by facemask policy and stay home policy were also performed. Each 1-microg/m(3) increase in annual average concentration of PM2.5 exposure was associated with 7.56% (95% CI: 3.76%, 11.49%) increase in COVID-19 risk. Facemask mandates and stay home policies were inversely associated with COVID-19 with adjusted RRs of 0.8466 (95% CI: 0.7598, 0.9432) and 0.9193 (95% CI: 0.8021, 1.0537), respectively. The associations between PM2.5 and COVID-19 were consistent among counties with or without preventive policies. Our study added evidence that long-term PM2.5 exposure increased the risk of COVID-19 during each surge and cumulatively as of 12 September 2020, in the United States. Although both state-level implementation of facemask mandates and stay home orders were effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19, no clear effect modification was observed regarding long-term exposure to PM2.5 on the risk of COVID-19.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) had struck the world with health and economic catastrophes and recently with unusual autoimmune presentations, including new-onset Type 1 Diabetes. Herein we present a 17-year-old male patient who presented to the Emergency room with fever, palpitation, and cough of four-week duration; he was referred to the Emergency room and was found to have DKA. CT of the chest showed ground-glass opacities suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia, and abdominal cuts showed dilated intrahepatic biliary radicles with pancreatic loculations suggestive of pancreatitis. The patient was admitted to the ICU, started on Intravenous fluids and Insulin infusion then COVID-19 PCR returned positive. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 has a vital role in eliciting an autoimmune response triggering Type 1 Diabetes, and further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. SARS-COV-2 may cause pancreatitis, and the first presentation could be high blood sugar or DKA.	Case Report
34220518	Suppression of Inflammatory Cardiac Cytokine Network in Rats with Untreated Obesity and Pre-Diabetes by AT2 Receptor Agonist NP-6A4. Obesity affects over 42% of the United States population and exacerbates heart disease, the leading cause of death in men and women. Obesity also increases pro-inflammatory cytokines that cause chronic tissue damage to vital organs. The standard-of-care does not sufficiently attenuate these inflammatory sequelae. Angiotensin II receptor AT2R is an anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular protective molecule; however, AT2R agonists are not used in the clinic to treat heart disease. NP-6A4 is a new AT2R peptide agonist with an FDA orphan drug designation for pediatric cardiomyopathy. NP-6A4 increases AT2R expression (mRNA and protein) and nitric oxide generation in human cardiovascular cells. AT2R-antagonist PD123319 and AT2RSiRNA suppress NP-6A4-effects indicating that NP-6A4 acts through AT2R. To determine whether NP-6A4 would mitigate cardiac damage from chronic inflammation induced by untreated obesity, we investigated the effects of 2-weeks NP-6A4 treatment (1.8 mg/kg delivered subcutaneously) on cardiac pathology of male Zucker obese (ZO) rats that display obesity, pre-diabetes and cardiac dysfunction. NP-6A4 attenuated cardiac diastolic and systolic dysfunction, cardiac fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, but increased myocardial capillary density. NP-6A4 treatment suppressed tubulointerstitial injury marker urinary beta-NAG, and liver injury marker alkaline phosphatase in serum. These protective effects of NP-6A4 occurred in the presence of obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia, and without modulating blood pressure. NP-6A4 increased expression of AT2R (consistent with human cells) and cardioprotective erythropoietin (EPO) and Notch1 in ZO rat heart, but suppressed nineteen inflammatory cytokines. Cardiac miRNA profiling and in silico analysis showed that NP-6A4 activated a unique miRNA network that may regulate expression of AT2R, EPO, Notch1 and inflammatory cytokines, and mitigate cardiac pathology. Seventeen pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines that increase during lethal cytokine storms caused by infections such as COVID-19 were among the cytokines suppressed by NP-6A4 treatment in ZO rat heart. Thus, NP-6A4 activates a novel anti-inflammatory network comprised of 21 proteins in the heart that was not reported previously. Since NP-6A4's unique mode of action suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine network and attenuates myocardial damage, it can be an ideal adjuvant drug with other anti-glycemic, anti-hypertensive, standard-of-care drugs to protect the heart tissues from pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokine attack induced by obesity.

34354361	Early Prediction of COVID-19 Ventilation Requirement and Mortality from Routinely Collected Baseline Chest Radiographs, Laboratory, and Clinical Data with Machine Learning. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and created a global pandemic that overwhelmed healthcare systems. COVID-19, as of July 3, 2021, yielded 182 million confirmed cases and 3.9 million deaths globally according to the World Health Organization. Several patients who were initially diagnosed with mild or moderate COVID-19 later deteriorated and were reclassified to severe disease type. Objective: The aim is to create a predictive model for COVID-19 ventilatory support and mortality early on from baseline (at the time of diagnosis) and routinely collected data of each patient (CXR, CBC, demographics, and patient history). Methods: Four common machine learning algorithms, three data balancing techniques, and feature selection are used to build and validate predictive models for COVID-19 mechanical requirement and mortality. Baseline CXR, CBC, demographic, and clinical data were retrospectively collected from April 2, 2020, till June 18, 2020, for 5739 patients with confirmed PCR COVID-19 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh. However, of those patients, only 1508 and 1513 have met the inclusion criteria for ventilatory support and mortalilty endpoints, respectively. Results: In an independent test set, ventilation requirement predictive model with top 20 features selected with reliefF algorithm from baseline radiological, laboratory, and clinical data using support vector machines and random undersampling technique attained an AUC of 0.87 and a balanced accuracy of 0.81. For mortality endpoint, the top model yielded an AUC of 0.83 and a balanced accuracy of 0.80 using all features with balanced random forest. This indicates that with only routinely collected data our models can predict the outcome with good performance. The predictive ability of combined data consistently outperformed each data set individually for intubation and mortality. For the ventilator support, chest X-ray severity annotations alone performed better than comorbidity, complete blood count, age, or gender with an AUC of 0.85 and balanced accuracy of 0.79. For mortality, comorbidity alone achieved an AUC of 0.80 and a balanced accuracy of 0.72, which is higher than models that use either chest radiograph, laboratory, or demographic features only. Conclusion: The experimental results demonstrate the practicality of the proposed COVID-19 predictive tool for hospital resource planning and patients' prioritization in the current COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

34286207	Collaborative critical care prediction and resource planning during the COVID-19 pandemic using computer simulation modelling: future urgent planning lessons. In March 2020, epidemiological modelling of COVID-19 predicted overwhelming demand on healthcare resources, yet data that emerged painted a different picture. Our management science health systems team at the University of Strathclyde collaborated with one NHS organisation to contextualise national policy and predict local resource needs before the pandemic took hold. Using action research, we combined organisational expertise, local and international data, and healthcare systems expertise to create a discrete event simulation model that predicted concurrent resource use over the first 10 weeks of the pandemic with realistic estimates of uncertainty. This allowed the organisation to create an effective strategy for resource planning. Had they followed national guidance, the costs would have been unwieldy and futile. Our decentralised approach delivered valuable information in a timely manner. This case study is unique in healthcare literature and serves as an example of successful methodology for similar crises.

34198800	In Silico and In Vitro Analyses Validate Human MicroRNAs Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 3'-UTR. COVID-19 pandemic is caused by betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The genome of this virus is composed of a single strand of RNA with 5' and 3'-UTR flanking a region of protein-coding ORFs closely resembling cells' mRNAs. MicroRNAs are endogenous post-transcriptional regulators that target mRNA to modulate protein expression and mediate cellular functions, including antiviral defense. In the present study, we carried out a bioinformatics screening to search for endogenous human microRNAs targeting the 3'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2. Results from the computational techniques allowed us to identify 10 potential candidates. The capacity of 3 of them, together with hsa-miR-138-5p, to target the SARS-CoV-2 3'-UTR was validated in vitro by gene reporter assays. Available information indicates that two of these microRNAs, namely, hsa-miR-3941 and hsa-miR-138-5p, combine effective targeting of SARS-CoV-2 genome with complementary antiviral or protective effects in the host cells that make them potential candidates for therapeutic treatment of most, if not all, COVID-19 variants known to date. All information obtained while conducting the present analysis is available at Open Science Framework repository.	Mechanism;Treatment
34211744	Analysis of the First 300 Cases of SARS CoV2 Infection from the Infection Disease Clinic of Craiova, Romania. COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic and an intermediate analysis of the first 300 cases treated in the Infectious Diseases Clinic from Craiova has been performed. We have found that most of the cases were asymptomatic or mild, but the severity of the symptomatic cases increases with age. The main comorbidities associated mainly with the severe cases were high blood pressure, obesity, other cardiac conditions, diabetes mellitus and malignancies. Inflammation, coagulation and metabolic disorders are significantly more expressed in critically ill patients. Fatality rate is relatively low, death seems to be associated with old age.	Diagnosis
34225610	Phytotherapic Drugs For Covid19 Treatment: A Scoping Review. BACKGROUND: The rapid eruption of Coronavirus at the end of 2019 has caused global health crisis and significant loss to the economy and social well-being. This created a massive shortage of advanced health facilities with inadequate medicinal supply, further deteriorating human health conditions. On the basis of adverse effects of the ongoing pandemic, this review is proposed to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of plant-based therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 (commonly called COVID19) infection. It highlights the possible action of the mechanism of phytotherapeutic drugs against coronavirus inhibition, further validated by clinical trials on herbal formulas. Though the experimental studies on COVID19 treatment are limited, the undesirable side effects of herbal drugs and unidentified compounds cannot be ignored. OBJECTIVE: We have made an effort to study the prospective plant-derived bioactive entities and their effectiveness in the treatment of COVID19 and emphasize safety and regulatory concerns of phytomedicines. METHODS: The methodology involves the relevant studies on COVID19 treatment based on herbal extracts and the purified bioactive metabolites. The e-literature survey is done by downloading research articles available on PubMed (National library of medicine), Elsevier, and Google scholar search engines. The keywords used are plant metabolites, natural bioactive, phytotherapeutic drugs, clinical trials, SARS-CoV-2, Coronavirus inhibitors and herbal extracts. RESULTS: The review pays particular attention to the etiological study of the COVID19 virus and its inhibition using medicinal plant metabolites as immunomodulatory agents. The application of valuable bioactive like phenolic compounds, saponins, alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids and terpenoids in preparing herbal formula/drug. The drug resistance of bioactive compounds and their side effects on human health were discussed for effective phytomedicine. Thus, emphasizing the perspectives of phytotherapeutic drugs as a safe remedy to boost immunomodulatory functions and antiviral activity against COVID19. CONCLUSION: Altogether, the review presents the action mechanism of plant extracts rich in bioactive compounds and depicted potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. These plant bioactive compounds can serve as lead molecules to develop phytomedicine, ensuring all safety regulations in the clinical trials to treat or prevent COVID19 viral infections.	Treatment
34370409	[Encephalitis following COVID-19 disease]. Shortly after that COVID-19 appeared it became clear, that although the disease mainly characterized by respiratory symptoms, other signs frequently appeared, which showed involvation of other organs. There are several new publications which report about neurological complications. According to data developing of encephalitis could be relatively frequent among these. Its symptoms can mostly be observed concommittantly with respiratory symptoms or during critical state of the disease, and several forms were detected. In our patient symptoms of central nervous system involvement appeared a few weeks after healing of COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical signs, imaging, electroencephalograpy and cerebrospinal fluid analysis confirmed the diagnosis of encephalitis. Considering the previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and the results of the examinations, we think this case was a postinfectious central nervous system disease. There are only a few data available regarding encephalitis after Covid-19 disease in the literature, yet.	Case Report
34368223	Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients With Lung Cancer: Experience From a Thoracic Oncology Center. Background: Cancer patients appear to be at a higher risk of complications from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Specific data related to lung cancer (LC) patient management, active treatment, and/or recent diagnosis are still very limited. Here, we aimed to investigate the clinical presentation, baseline features, and clinical outcomes of LC patients with COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective case study was performed at Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Sao Joao, a tertiary hospital in the North of Portugal. Data from LC patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were collected during the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020-January 2021). Results: Twenty-eight patients with active LC were diagnosed with COVID-19, being adenocarcinoma the most common histological type present (n = 13, 46.4%). Sixteen patients had metastatic stage IV LC (61.5%). Twenty-five patients (89.3%) had relevant comorbidities including hypertension (39.3%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (32.1%). For patients undergoing antineoplastic treatment, the median time from the last chemotherapy administration to COVID-19 diagnosis was of 16 days (interquartile range = 13-41 days). Half of patients were previously on corticosteroid therapy. Twenty patients (71.4%) needed hospitalization, 18 received oxygen therapy (64.3%), 3 (10.7%) of them received high-flow nasal cannula with good tolerability, and 1 (3.6%) needed non-invasive ventilation. Hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics were given to 4 (14.3%) and 12 (42.9%) patients, respectively. Seven patients (25%) died at a median time of 5 days following COVID-19 diagnosis. Conclusion: This is one of the first studies reporting the adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19 in LC patients at same time that adds evidence regarding the need to create protocols and guidelines to reduce the infection risk in such patients.

34332999	Diabetic ketoacidosis in pediatric patients with type 1- and type 2 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic caused families to stay home and cancel everyday activities. Hospital admissions decreased, affecting changes in diagnoses and management of chronic disease in children. AIMS: We analyzed how the first lockdown influenced clinical presentation and manifestation of children with diabetes mellitus (DM) in a German University Hospital. METHODS: During March 15th and October 11th 2020, data on general patient information, clinical symptoms and on lab results related to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were analyzed in children (0-18years) who presented with new onset of DM or poor metabolic control of known DM. All data including frequency and severity of DKA were compared to data from patients who presented in 2019. RESULTS: Data from 125 participants with DM were evaluated (2020: n=52; 2019: n=73). In 2020, twelve patients (23.1%) were diagnosed with new onset DM, two of them with type2 diabetes, and 66.7% presented with DKA including both patients T2DM. In 2019, 24.5% of patients had new onset DM, and 50% of them presented with DKA. In 2020, patients with new onset DM were younger, presented with more severe symptoms of DKA and had to stay longer in hospital compared to 2019. In 2020, six children (50%) with new onset DM were <6years, whereas in 2019 most children with new onset DM were adolescents (n=7, 38.9%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 lockdown aggravated complications of diabetes onset and therapy management, including severity and frequency of DKA. It underlines the need of health education for early DKA diagnosis to early identify children at risk.	Prevention
34284145	Correlation of hemoglobin A1c and outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a known risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted this study to determine if there is a correlation between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level and poor outcomes in hospitalized patients with diabetes and COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-center, observational study of patients with diabetes (as defined by an HbA1c >/= 6.5% or known medical history of diabetes) who had a confirmed case of COVID-19 and required hospitalization. All patients were admitted to our institution between March 3, 2020 and May 5, 2020. HbA1c results for each patient were divided into quartiles; 5.1-6.7% (32-50 mmol/mol), 6.8-7.5% (51-58 mmol/mol), 7.6-8.9% (60-74 mmol/mol), and >9% (>75 mmol/mol). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included admission to an intensive care unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury, acute thrombosis, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Five hundred and six patients were included. The number of deaths within quartiles 1 through 4 were 30 (25%), 37 (27%), 34 (27%) and 24 (19%), respectively. There was no statistical difference in the primary or secondary outcomes between the quartiles except acute kidney injury was less frequent in quartile 4. CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant association between HbA1c level and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes who are hospitalized with COVID-19. HbA1c should not be used for risk stratification in these patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34130866	Neuromuscular blockade administration is associated with altered energy expenditure in critically ill intubated patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND & AIMS: ESPEN guidelines advocate that energy needs of critically ill patients with COVID 19 should be assessed using indirect calorimetry, if safely available. This study described energy needs of intubated patients with COVID-19 and explores whether neuromuscular blockade administration (NMBAs) is associated with altered energy expenditure. METHODS: Resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory exchange rate (RER) evaluated among critically ill intubated COVID-19 patients until 28th day of intensive care unit stay (ICU-S) by indirect calorimetry. Paralysed patients were defined as those with drug induced paralysis using cicatracurium, for at least 3 days during their ICU-S. RESULTS: 34 adult COVID 19 patients (59.8% male, 35.2% obese) requiring mechanical ventilation were assessed prospectively. REE measurements suggest a gradual increase of energy needs post 3rd day of ICU-S in both patients without obesity (non ob) ((from 17.8 kcal/kgr up to 29.3 kcal/kgr actual body weight (AcBW) during 28th day of ICU-S, p = 0.011)) and patients with obesity (ob) ((from 18.1 kcal/kgr up to 30.1 kcal/kgr adjusted body weight (AjBW) during 28th day of ICU-S, p = 0.021)). NMBAs use was accompanied by a significant drop in REE, especially during first 7 days of hospitalization, both in non ob (22.9 vs 17.9 kcal/kgr AcBW, p = 0.014) and ob patients (22.5 vs 19.5 kcal/kgr ABW, p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: We identified the energy needs of COVID-19 intubated patients and highlighted a significant increase beyond the 1st week in the ICU. Administration of NMBAs should be considered, as it may impact resting energy expenditure.	Treatment
34222500	Knowledge, skill, and preventive behaviors regarding COVID-19 among the public in Shahrekord of Iran. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a serious and costly problem for communities. Observing health issues and performing preventive behaviors is influenced by their knowledge and skills of people toward COVID-19. Hence, this study investigated the knowledge, skill, and practice of the public of Shahrekord toward COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The present study was performed as a cross sectional. Data were collected using an online questionnaire from 540 Shahrekord residents who were selected via convenience sampling in 2020. Knowledge, skill, and practice toward COVID-19 were assessed using a prevalidated questionnaire. Collected data were analyzed by SPSS-21 software (one-way analysis of variance, Pearson test, and regression test). RESULTS: In this study, 39.1% were male, and 60.9% were female and 46.3% were 20-25 years. The mean score of knowledge, skill, and preventive behaviors was 75.69 +/- 17.85, 53.87 +/- 27.40, and 59.97 +/- 23.79, respectively. There was a significant direct relationship between knowledge and skill (P = 0.05 and r = 081) so that public with more knowledge had a better skill as well. There was a significant association between age (P = 0.036), education level (P = 0.019) , and job (P = 0.014) with knowledge. In addition, a significant association between job (P = 0.027) and marital status (P = 0.014) with skill was observed. Knowledge, skill, and demographic variables predict 37.6% preventive behavior. CONCLUSION: The majority of the participants had good knowledge, moderate skill, and relatively enough practice. Government and policymakers must consider these knowledge levels, skill, and practices to implement productive interventions for preventing the COVID-19.	Prevention
34213848	SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, where do we stand? Vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic, represents a major infection control strategy in the absence of effective treatment of the disease to date. Unprecedented mobilization has led to the development of a large number of projects, some of which have already been in test in humans for several months. The first efficacy and safety data are expected in the coming weeks. New vaccine technologies are being evaluated (RNA, replicating or non-replicating viral vectors), further increasing the chances of success. The criteria for evaluating vaccines-despite the exceptional speed of their development-must remain rigorous enough to ensure their acceptance by the population. Beyond their development, mass production and equitable distribution raise many questions. Finally, vaccination can only be successfully implemented if health professionals and the population are convinced of its validity, which implies particular attention to the quality of the information given and the methods of communication.

34289024	SPOT: a web-tool enabling swift profiling of transcriptomes. : The increasing number of single cell and bulk RNAseq datasets describing complex gene expression profiles in different organisms, organs or cell types calls for an intuitive tool allowing rapid comparative analysis. Here we present Swift Profiling Of Transcriptomes (SPOT) as a web tool that allows not only differential expression analysis but also fast ranking of genes fitting transcription profiles of interest. Based on a heuristic approach the spot algorithm ranks the genes according to their proximity to the user-defined gene expression profile of interest. The best hits are visualized as a table, bar chart or dot plot and can be exported as an Excel file. While the tool is generally applicable, we tested it on RNAseq data from malaria parasites that undergo multiple stage transformations during their complex life cycle as well as on data from multiple human organs during development and cell lines infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SPOT should enable non-bioinformaticians to easily analyse their own and any available dataset. AVAILABILITY: SPOT is freely available for (academic) use at: https://frischknechtlab.shinyapps.io/SPOT/ and https://github.com/EliasFarr/SPOT. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	Mechanism
34133162	Interactive Interface for Graph-Based Analyses of Dynamic H-Bond Networks: Application to Spike Protein S. Dynamic hydrogen-bond networks are key determinants of protein conformational dynamics. In the case of macromolecular protein complexes, which can have a large number of hydrogen bonds giving rise to extensive hydrogen-bond networks, efficient algorithms are required to analyze interactions that could be important for the dynamics and biological function of the complex. We present here a highly efficient, standalone interface designed for analyses of dynamical hydrogen-bond networks of biomolecules and macromolecular complexes. To facilitate a comprehensive description of protein dynamics, the interface includes analyses of hydrophobic interactions. We illustrate the usefulness and workflow of the interface by dissecting the dynamics of the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 protein S in its closed conformation. We find that protein S contains numerous local clusters of dynamic hydrogen bonds and identify hydrogen bonds that are sampled persistently. The receptor binding domain of the spike protein hosts only a handful of persistent hydrogen-bond clusters, suggesting structural plasticity. Our data analysis interface is released here for open use.	Mechanism
34352196	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and Pregnancy Outcomes According to Gestational Age at Time of Infection. We conducted an international multicenter retrospective cohort study, PregOuTCOV, to examine the effect of gestational age at time of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. We included all singleton pregnancies with a live fetus at 10 weeks' gestation in which pregnancy outcomes were known. The exposed group consisted of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas the unexposed group consisted of all remaining patients during the same period. Primary outcomes were defined as composite adverse obstetric outcomes and composite adverse neonatal outcomes. Of 10,925 pregnant women, 393 (3.60%) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (exposed group). After matching for possible confounders, we identified statistically significant increases in the exposed group of composite adverse obstetric outcomes at >20 weeks' gestation and of composite adverse neonatal outcomes at >26 weeks' gestation (p<0.001). Vaccination programs should target women early in pregnancy or before conception, if possible.	Prevention
34222295	Pandemic Worry and Preventive Health Behaviors During the COVID-19 Outbreak. Objective: As schools are preparing for onsite learning, it is urgently needed to characterize the extent of pandemic worry and to examine predictors of adopting preventive health behaviors of hand washing, face mask wearing, and maintaining social distance among student pharmacists. Methods: An online survey was sent to 326 student pharmacists in the United States. Pandemic worry was measured using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from extremely not afraid of, to extremely afraid of getting COVID-19. The health belief model (HBM) was the theoretical framework of this study. Preventive health behaviors and components of the HBM were also measured using seven-point Likert scales (one indicated extremely unlikely; seven indicated extremely likely). Multivariable linear regression models were used to identify predictors of each behavior. Results: A medium level of pandemic worry (M = 4.2, SD = 1.92) was identified and females reported a higher pandemic worry. Respondents reported that they were extremely likely to wash their hands (M = 6.8, SD = 0.48) and maintain social distance (M = 6.6, SD = 0.92), but were moderately unlikely to wear face masks (M = 2.2, SD = 1.51). Determinants of face mask wearing included pandemic worry, perceived benefits, cue to action, self-efficacy, and being of an Asian American. Perceived barriers were negatively associated with face mask wearing. Conclusion: Strategies should be implemented to reduce the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic among student pharmacists. Predictors identified in this study should be incorporated in efforts to improve face mask wearing. Continued monitoring of pandemic worry and preventive health behaviors is of great significance when universities and colleges are for onsite learning.	Prevention
34202817	Neurosurgical Considerations Regarding Decompressive Craniectomy for Intracerebral Hemorrhage after SARS-CoV-2-Vaccination in Vaccine Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia-VITT. Given the ongoing global SARS-CoV-2-vaccination efforts, clinical awareness needs to be raised regarding the possibility of an increased incidence of SARS-CoV-2-vaccine-related immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) secondary to cerebral sinus and vein thrombosis (CVT) requiring (emergency) neurosurgical treatment in the context of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Only recently, an association of vaccinations and cerebral sinus and vein thrombosis has been described. In a number of cases, neurosurgical treatment is warranted for these patients and special considerations are warranted when addressing the perioperative coagulation. We, herein, describe the past management of patients with VITT and established a literature-guided algorithm for the treatment of patients when addressing the impaired coagulation in these patients. Increasing insights addressing the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2-vaccine-related immune-mediated thrombocytopenia guide physicians in developing an interdisciplinary algorithm taking into account the special considerations of this disease.

34201967	Study of the Plasma and Buffy Coat in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection-A Preliminary Report. The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection affects many aspects of public health knowledge, science, and practice around the world. Several studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma seems to be associated with a worse prognosis of COVID-19. In the present study, we investigated plasma and buffy RNA in patients with COVID-19 to determine its prognostic value. A prospective study was carried out in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, in which RNA was analyzed in plasma and the buffy coat. Morphological and immunohistochemical studies were used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the buffy coat. In COVID-19 patients, the obtained RNA concentration in plasma was 448.3 +/- 31.30 ng/mL. Of all the patients with positive plasma tests for SARS-CoV-2, 46.15% died from COVID-19. In four cases, tests revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was present in the buffy coat. Abnormal morphology of monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils was found. An immunohistochemical study showed positivity in mononuclear cells and platelets. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is present in the plasma. This facilitates viral dissemination and migration to specific organs, where SARS-CoV-2 infects target cells by binding to their receptors. In our study, the presence of plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA was correlated with worse prognoses.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34198600	Structural Topic Model Analysis of Mask-Wearing Issue Using International News Big Data. Media plays an important role in the acquisition of health information worldwide. This was particularly evident in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic. Relatedly, it is practical and desirable for people to wear masks for health, fashion, and religious regions. However, depending on cultural differences, people naturally accept wearing a mask, or they look upon it negatively. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread mask-wearing mandates worldwide. In the case of COVID-19, wearing a mask is strongly recommended, so by analyzing the news data before and after the spread of the epidemic, it is possible to see how the direction of crisis management is being structured. In particular, by utilizing big data analysis of international news data, discourses around the world can be analyzed more deeply. This study collected and analyzed 58,061 international news items related to mask-wearing from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020. The collected dataset was compared before and after the World Health Organization's pandemic declaration by applying structural topic model analysis. The results revealed that prior to the declaration, issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak were emphasized, but afterward, issues related to movement restrictions, quarantine management, and local economic impacts emerged.

34208462	A COVID-19 Exposure at a Dental Clinic Where Healthcare Workers Routinely Use Particulate Filtering Respirators. Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients produce a considerable amount of virus and transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through close contact. Preventing in-hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is challenging, since symptom-based screening protocols may miss asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients. In particular, dental healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of exposure, as face-to-face contact and exposure to oral secretions is unavoidable. We report exposure of HCWs during dental procedures on a mild symptomatic COVID-19 patient. A 32-year-old male visited a dental clinic at a tertiary care hospital. He experienced mild cough, which started three days before the dental visit, but did not report his symptom during the entrance screening. He underwent several dental procedures and imaging for orthognathic surgery without wearing a mask. Seven HCWs were closely exposed to the patient during dental procedures that could have generated droplets and aerosols. One HCW had close contact with the patient during radiologic exams, and seven HCWs had casual contact. All HCWs wore particulate filtering respirators with 94% filter capacity and gloves, but none wore eye protection or gowns. The next day, the patient experienced dysgeusia and was diagnosed with COVID-19 with high viral load. All HCWs who had close contact with the patient were quarantined for 14 days, and polymerase chain reaction and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. This exposure event suggests the protective effect of particulate filtering respirators in dental clinics. The recommendations of different levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) for dental HCWs according to the procedure types should be established according to the planned procedure, the risk of COVID-19 infection of the patient, and the outbreak situation of the community.

34200621	Field and Molecular Epidemiology: How Viral Sequencing Changed Transmission Inferences in the First Portuguese SARS-CoV-2 Infection Cluster. Field epidemiology and viral sequencing provide a comprehensive characterization of transmission chains and allow a better identification of superspreading events. However, very few examples have been presented to date during the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied the first COVID-19 cluster detected in Portugal (59 individuals involved amongst extended family and work environments), following the return of four related individuals from work trips to Italy. The first patient to introduce the virus would be misidentified following the traditional field inquiry alone, as shown by the viral sequencing in isolates from 23 individuals. The results also pointed out family, and not work environment, as the primary mode of transmission.	Transmission
34348975	Comprehensive Immunologic Evaluation of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Samples from Human Patients with Moderate and Severe Seasonal Influenza and Severe COVID-19. Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) or seasonal influenza may lead to respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The pathophysiology of this respiratory failure is attributed to local immune dysregulation, but how the immune response to viral infection in the lower airways of the human lung differs between individuals with respiratory failure and those without is not well understood. We used quantitative multiparameter flow cytometry and multiplex cytokine assays to evaluate matched blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from control human subjects, subjects with symptomatic seasonal influenza who did not have respiratory failure, and subjects with severe seasonal influenza or SARS-CoV-2 infection with respiratory failure. We find that severe cases are associated with an influx of nonclassical monocytes, activated T cells, and plasmablast B cells into the lower airways. Cytokine concentrations were not elevated in the lower airways of moderate influenza patients compared with controls; however, 28 of 35 measured cytokines were significantly elevated in severe influenza, severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, or both. We noted the largest elevations in IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1, and IL-8. IL-1 family cytokines and RANTES were higher in severe influenza infection than severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, only the concentration of IP-10-correlated between blood and BAL during severe infection. Our results demonstrate inflammatory immune dysregulation in the lower airways during severe viral pneumonia that is distinct from lower airway responses seen in human patients with symptomatic, but not severe, illness and suggest that measurement of blood IP-10 concentration may predict this unique dysregulation.

34217573	Specialist confirmed allergic reactions to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines at a mass vaccination site. Healthcare providers can play a key role in reaching the target for vaccine uptake through educating the public on the risk may be of severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. Thus, it is important to resolve reports in the literature which present conflicting data on vaccine safety. We performed a prospective study of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinations administered at the Albany Community Vaccination Center. All potential vaccinees to the site were screened for allergic history prior to triage by a board-certified allergist. In the first 14 days of operation, our site vaccinated 14,655 individuals, 3.9% of which had a personal history of anaphylaxis. While some vaccine recipients had non-allergic complications, none of the visitors suffered any objective, immediate allergic symptoms. Our findings indicate that specialist-confirmed rates of immediate allergic reaction to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are far lower than self-reported rates defined by subjective, unconfirmed symptoms.

34205536	B-Type Natriuretic Peptides and High-Sensitive Troponin I as COVID-19 Survival Factors: Which One Is the Best Performer? Increased concentrations of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin I (HsTnI) in COVID-19 patients have already been reported. The aim of this study is to evaluate which of these common markers of cardiac disease is the most useful predictor of fatal outcome in COVID-19 patients. One hundred and seventy-four patients affected with COVID-19 were recruited, and markers of cardiac disease and the clinical history of the patients were collected at admission in the infectious disease unit or intensive care unit. NT-proBNP, BNP and HsTnI values were higher in in-hospital non-surviving patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of NT-proBNP, BNP and HsTnI was performed, with NT-proBNP (AUC = 0.951) and HsTnI (AUC = 0.947) being better performers (p = 0.01) than BNP (AUC = 0.777). Logistic regression was performed assessing the relation of HsTnI and NT-proBNP to fatal outcome adjusting for age and gender, with only NT-proBNP being significant. The population was then divided into two groups, one with higher NT-proBNP values at admission than the cut-off resulted from the ROC curve (511 ng/L) and a second one with lower values. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an absence of fatal outcome in the group of patients with NT-proBNP values lower than the cut-off (p < 0.001). NT-proBNP proved to be the best prognostic tool for fatal outcome among markers of cardiac disease in COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34224948	Modelling SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a UK university setting. Around 40% of school leavers in the UK attend university and individual universities generally host thousands of students each academic year. Bringing together these student communities during the COVID-19 pandemic may require strong interventions to control transmission. Prior modelling analyses of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within universities using compartmental modelling approaches suggest that outbreaks are almost inevitable. We constructed a network-based model to capture the interactions of a student population in different settings (housing, social and study). For a single academic term of a representative campus-based university, we ran a susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered type epidemic process, parameterised according to available estimates for SARS-CoV-2. We investigated the impact of: adherence to (or effectiveness of) isolation and test and trace measures; room isolation of symptomatic students; and supplementary mass testing. With all adhering to test, trace and isolation measures, we found that 22% (7%-41%) of the student population could be infected during the autumn term, compared to 69% (56%-76%) when assuming zero adherence to such measures. Irrespective of the adherence to isolation measures, on average a higher proportion of students resident on-campus became infected compared to students resident off-campus. Room isolation generated minimal benefits. Regular mass testing, together with high adherence to isolation and test and trace measures, could substantially reduce the proportion infected during the term compared to having no testing. Our findings suggest SARS-CoV-2 may readily transmit in a university setting if there is limited adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions and/or there are delays in receiving test results. Following isolation guidance and effective contact tracing curbed transmission and reduced the expected time an adhering student would spend in isolation.	Prevention;Transmission
34212921	Predictors of Clinical Outcomes in Adult COVID-19 Patients Admitted to a Tertiary Care Hospital in India: an analytical cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: The outbreak ofsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted inexponential rise in the number of patients getting hospitalised with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a paucity of data from South East Asian Region related to the predictors of clinical outcomes in these patients. This formed the basis of conducting our study. METHODS: This was an analytical cross-sectional study. Demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data of 125 patients was collected on admission. The study outcome was death or discharge after recovery. For univariate analysis, unpaired t-test, Chi-square and Fisher's Exact test were used. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and few laboratory parameters. Logistic regression was applied for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Elderly age, ischemic heart disease and smoking were significantly associated with mortality. Elevated levels of D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reduced lymphocyte counts were the predictors of mortality. The ROCs for SOFA score curve showed a cut-off value >/= 3.5 (sensitivity- 91.7% and specificity- 87.5%), for IL-6 the cut-off value was >/= 37.9 (sensitivity- 96% and specificity- 78%) and for lymphocyte counts, a cut off was calculated to be less than and equal to 1.46 x 109per litre (sensitivity-75.2%and specificity- 83.3%). CONCLUSION: Old age, smoking history, ischemic heart disease and laboratory parameters including elevated D-dimer, raised LDH and low lymphocyte counts at baseline are associated with COVID-19 mortality. A higher SOFA score at admission is a poor prognosticator in COVID-19 patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34198381	Mathematical modeling and dynamic analysis of SIQR model with delay for pandemic COVID-19. On the basis of the SIQR epidemic model, we consider the impact of treatment time on the epidemic situation, and we present a differential equation model with time-delay according to the characteristics of COVID-19. Firstly, we analyze the existence and stability of the equilibria in the modified COVID-19 epidemic model. Secondly, we analyze the existence of Hopf bifurcation, and derive the normal form of Hopf bifurcation by using the multiple time scales method. Then, we determine the direction of Hopf bifurcation and the stability of bifurcating periodic solutions. Finally, we carry out numerical simulations to verify the correctness of theoretical analysis with actual parameters, and show conclusions associated with the critical treatment time and the effect on epidemic for treatment time.

34282078	The Role of Micronutrient and Immunomodulation effect in the vaccine era of COVID-19. Different dietary nutrients have distinct effects, including enhancing immune response activity and supporting mucous membrane integrity. These effects are critical in fighting against pathogenic agents, which cover COVID-19, the coronavirus disease that shuts down globally. Recent researches have shown that micronutrient deficiency is commonly associated with compromised immune responses, respiratory tract infections, or even susceptibility to COVID-19. The relationship between Vit A and infection is its role in mucosal epithelium integrity (skin and mucous membrane), the supplementation could be an option for assisted-treating the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a possible prevention of lung infection. Vit C/ascorbic acid stimulates oxygen radical scavenging activity of the skin and enhances epithelial barrier function. Ascorbic acid alone or with other natural compounds (baicalin and theafalvin) may inhibit the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme II in human small alveolar epithelial cells and limited the entry of SARS-CoV-2. Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) can be expressed by immune cells, and different immune cells (macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells) can convert Vit D into its active form 1,25-(OH)2 D. Oral vitamin D intake can be a readily way to restrict the viral infection through down regulation of ACE2 receptor and to attenuate the disease severity by decreasing the frequency of cytokine storm and pulmonary pro-inflammatory response. Vit E supports T-cell mediated functions, optimization of Th1 response and suppression of Th2 response. Vitamin E supplementation can lower the production of superoxides and may favors the antioxidants and benefit the progress of COVID-19 treatment. Zinc plays an essential role in both innate and adaptive immune systems and cytokine production, and Zinc-dependent viral enzymes to initiate the infectious process have proved the Zinc levels are directly associated with symptoms relieved of COVID-19. Iron is an essential component of enzymes involved in the activation of immune cells, lower iron levels predispose to severe symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, and monitoring the status can predict the disease severity and mortality. Selenium participates in the adaptive immune response by supporting antibody production and development. Deficiency can reduce antibody concentration, decreased cytotoxicity of NK cells, compromised cellular immunity, and an attenuated response to vaccination. The COVID-19 vaccines including three broad categories, protein-base vaccines, gene-based vaccines (mRNA vaccines and DNA vaccines), combination of gene and protein-based vaccines. Micronutrients are involved in immunity from the virus entering the human to innate immune response and adaptive immune response. Micronutrients are indispensable in immune response of vaccination.

34217292	Are preventive measures adequate? An evaluation of the implementation of COVID-19 prevention and control measures in nursing homes in China. BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a challenge for nursing homes in China. Nursing homes are particularly dangerous places in terms of the spread of COVID-19 given that they house vulnerable, high-risk populations. As such, several useful guidelines for coping with COVID-19 in nursing homes have been provided. However, the actual implementation rates of such guidelines are unknown. This study aims to document the adherence of nursing homes to the Ministry of Civil Affairs guidelines for COVID-19 prevention and control in nursing homes. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 484 nursing homes in 136 cities of 28 provinces in China. A self-report questionnaire was created based on the Ministry of Civil Affairs guidelines for COVID-19 prevention and control in nursing homes (first edition). The questionnaire and the Transformational Leadership in the Public Sector Scale were sent to nursing home managers via the Wenjuanxing app online from February 7 to 29, 2020. Ultimately, 461 of 960 nursing homes participated, for a response rate of 48.0%. RESULTS: The average overall implementation rate of COVID-19 prevention and control measures was 80.0% (143.97/180). The average implementation rates for hygienic behaviour management and access management were lower, at 75.3 and 78.7%, respectively. Number of medical staff and transformational leadership score of nursing home's manager were associated with total implementation score (p < 0.05). A total of 69.8% (322/461) of the nursing home managers had serious resource problems, and inadequate protective supplies (72.0%) and staff shortages (47.7%) were the two primary problems. The nursing homes that located in urban, with large nursing home size, had hospital-nursing home cooperation and the transformational leadership score of manager> 60, had a lower risk of having serious resource problems. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the implementation of prevention and control measures by nursing homes are insufficient during the epidemic in China. More medical staff, adequate resource, cooperation with hospitals, and higher transformational leadership of manager are required to improve the implementation rate. It is urgent for nursing homes to maintain the safety of residents and staff.	Prevention
34217144	Vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19 treatment: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Vitamin-D is an immune-modulator which might be linked to disease severity by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Meta-analysis of RCTs and quasi-experimental studies, evaluating the role of vitamin-D supplementation in COVID patients was done. RESULTS: Total 5 studies (3 RCTs and 2 Quasi-experimental) including n = 467 patients were included. Vitamin D didn't reduce mortality (RR 0.55, 95%CI 0.22 to 1.39, p = 0.21), ICU admission rates (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01-4.26, p = 0.3) and need for invasive ventilation (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.01-7.89, p = 0.42). CONCLUSION: No significant difference with vitamin-D supplementation on major health related outcomes in COVID-19. Well-designed RCTs are required addressing this topic.	Treatment
34218279	The Covid-19 pandemic and its concomitant benefits: improved hygiene habits. In an editorial, the editor has explored how state response to the pandemic has collateral damages not only in the public health in general but also in economy and education. Ironically, it also shows that the adjustments and adaptations in peoples' behavior have resulted in improved habits in personal hygiene and self-care. Not all is bad though as people have (re)learned the basic value of handwashing and preventive measures to avoid any diseases and spread of germs. In the long run, this is going to be beneficial to prevent any repeat of the pandemic of this magnitude.	Prevention
34214122	Identifying factors that nurses consider in the decision-making process related to patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: Nurse identification of patient deterioration is critical, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as patients can deteriorate quickly. While the literature has shown that nurses rely on intuition to make decisions, there is limited information on what sources of data experienced nurses utilize to inform their intuition. The objectives of this study were to identify sources of data that inform nurse decision-making related to recognition of deteriorating patients, and explore how COVID-19 has impacted nurse decision-making. METHODS: In this qualitative study, experienced nurses voluntarily participated in focused interviews. During focused interviews, expert nurses were asked to share descriptions of memorable patient encounters, and questions were posed to facilitate reflections on thoughts and actions that hindered or helped their decision-making. They were also asked to consider the impact of COVID-19 on nursing and decision-making. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, study team members reviewed transcripts and coded responses, and organized key findings into themes. RESULTS: Several themes related to decision-making were identified by the research team, including: identifying patient care needs, workload management, and reflecting on missed care opportunities to inform learning. Participants (n = 10) also indicated that COVID-19 presented a number of unique barriers to nurse decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study indicate that experienced nurses utilize several sources of information to inform their intuition. It is apparent that the demands on nurses in response to pandemics are heightened. Decision-making themes drawn from participants' experiences can to assist nurse educators for training nursing students on decision-making for deteriorating patients and how to manage the potential barriers (e.g., resource constraints, lack of family) associated with caring for patients during these challenging times prior to encountering these issues in the clinical environment. Nurse practice can utilize these findings to increase awareness among experienced nurses on recognizing how pandemic situations can impact to their decision-making capability.	Prevention
34377601	Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on Ocular Surface Pathology and Treatment Practices: a Review. Purpose of Review: The ocular surface is a potential site of ocular involvement by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a review of the literature to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 disease manifestations on the ocular surface as well as to elucidate emerging treatment patterns and practice changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent Findings: The ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are likely limited to a mild and transient conjunctivitis. Other manifestations have not been validated in larger cohorts. Ocular surface tissue should be considered potentially infectious due to the presence of host receptors on surface tissues. The availability of donor tissue in lower-middle income countries has been greatly impacted by the pandemic and would benefit from further investigation into transmissibility through donor tissue. Summary: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the ocular surface has yet to be confirmed. The most common ocular manifestation is a mild conjunctivitis. Ocular surface surgeons face specific challenges in the use of donor tissues and aerosolizing procedures and have adapted practice patterns accordingly.	Diagnosis;Prevention;Transmission
34200116	Strategies to Improve Antimicrobial Utilization with a Special Focus on Developing Countries. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a high priority across countries as it increases morbidity, mortality and costs. Concerns with AMR have resulted in multiple initiatives internationally, nationally and regionally to enhance appropriate antibiotic utilization across sectors to reduce AMR, with the overuse of antibiotics exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Effectively tackling AMR is crucial for all countries. Principally a narrative review of ongoing activities across sectors was undertaken to improve antimicrobial use and address issues with vaccines including COVID-19. Point prevalence surveys have been successful in hospitals to identify areas for quality improvement programs, principally centering on antimicrobial stewardship programs. These include reducing prolonged antibiotic use to prevent surgical site infections. Multiple activities centering on education have been successful in reducing inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antimicrobials in ambulatory care for essentially viral infections such as acute respiratory infections. It is imperative to develop new quality indicators for ambulatory care given current concerns, and instigate programs with clear public health messaging to reduce misinformation, essential for pandemics. Regular access to effective treatments is needed to reduce resistance to treatments for HIV, malaria and tuberculosis. Key stakeholder groups can instigate multiple initiatives to reduce AMR. These need to be followed up.	Prevention
34219975	Images denoising for COVID-19 chest X-ray based on multi-resolution parallel residual CNN. Chest X-ray (CXR) is a medical imaging technology that is common and economical to use in clinical. Recently, coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, and the second wave is rebounding strongly now with the coming winter that has a detrimental effect on the global economy and health. To make pre-diagnosis of COVID-19 as soon as possible, and reduce the work pressure of medical staff, making use of deep learning networks to detect positive CXR images of infected patients is a critical step. However, there are complex edge structures and rich texture details in the CXR images susceptible to noise that can interfere with the diagnosis of the machines and the doctors. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel multi-resolution parallel residual CNN (named MPR-CNN) for CXR images denoising and special application for COVID-19 which can improve the image quality. The core of MPR-CNN consists of several essential modules. (a) Multi-resolution parallel convolution streams are utilized for extracting more reliable spatial and semantic information in multi-scale features. (b) Efficient channel and spatial attention can let the network focus more on texture details in CXR images with fewer parameters. (c) The adaptive multi-resolution feature fusion method based on attention is utilized to improve the expression of the network. On the whole, MPR-CNN can simultaneously retain spatial information in the shallow layers with high resolution and semantic information in the deep layers with low resolution. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our MPR-CNN can better retain the texture structure details in CXR images. Additionally, extensive experiments show that our MPR-CNN has a positive impact on CXR images classification and detection of COVID-19 cases from denoised CXR images.	Diagnosis
34209964	COVID-19 and the Endocrine System: A Comprehensive Review on the Theme. BACKGROUND AND AIM: The review aimed to summarize advances in the topic of endocrine diseases and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Scientific and institutional websites and databases were searched and data were collected and organized, when plausible, to angle the discussion toward the following clinical issues. (1) Are patients with COVID-19 at higher risk of developing acute or late-onset endocrine diseases or dysfunction? (2) May the underlying endocrine diseases or dysfunctions be considered risk factors for poor prognosis once the infection has occurred? (3) Are there defined strategies to manage endocrine diseases despite pandemic-related constraints? Herein, the authors considered only relevant and more frequently observed endocrine diseases and disorders related to the hypothalamic-pituitary region, thyroid and parathyroid glands, calcium-phosphorus homeostasis and osteoporosis, adrenal glands, and gonads. Main. Data highlight the basis of some pathophysiological mechanisms and anatomical alterations of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced endocrine dysfunctions. Some conditions, such as adrenal insufficiency and cortisol excess, may be risk factors of worse clinical progression once the infection has occurred. These at-risk populations may require adequate education to avoid the SARS-CoV-2 infection and adequately manage medical therapy during the pandemic, even in emergencies. Endocrine disease management underwent a palpable restraint, especially procedures requiring obligate access to healthcare facilities for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Strategies of clinical triage to prioritize medical consultations, laboratory, instrumental evaluations, and digital telehealth solutions should be implemented to better deal with this probably long-term situation.

34220301	Hybrid harmony search algorithm for social network contact tracing of COVID-19. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and then moved to almost every country showing an unprecedented outbreak. The world health organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, millions of people were infected, and millions have lost their lives all around the globe. By the end of 2020, effective vaccines that could prevent the fast spread of the disease started to loom on the horizon. Nevertheless, isolation, social distancing, face masks, and quarantine are the best-known measures, in the time being, to fight the pandemic. On the other hand, contact tracing is an effective procedure in tracking infections and saving others' lives. In this paper, we devise a new approach using a hybrid harmony search (HHS) algorithm that casts the problem of finding strongly connected components (SCCs) to contact tracing. This new approach is named as hybrid harmony search contact tracing (HHS-CT) algorithm. The hybridization is achieved by integrating the stochastic hill climbing into the operators' design of the harmony search algorithm. The HHS-CT algorithm is compared to other existing algorithms of finding SCCs in directed graphs, where it showed its superiority over these algorithms. The devised approach provides a 77.18% enhancement in terms of run time and an exceptional average error rate of 1.7% compared to the other existing algorithms of finding SCCs.	Prevention
34207873	Bad Prognosis in Critical Ill Patients with COVID-19 during Short-Term ICU Stay regarding Vitamin D Levels. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vitamin D inadequacy may be involved in the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and in potential risk factors for disease propagation or control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study assessed a short-term evolution of vitamin D status and its influence upon different clinical parameters in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective analytical study in which 37 critically ill volunteers between 41 and 71 years of age with COVID-19 were evaluated at baseline and three days of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. 25-OH-D3 and 25-OH-D2 were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and total 25-OH-D levels were calculated as the sum of both. RESULTS: All patients presented low 25-OH-D levels at baseline, decreasing total 25-OH-D (p = 0.011) mainly through 25-OH-D2 (p = 0.006) levels during ICU stay. 25-OH-D2 levels decreased a mean of 41.6% +/- 89.6% versus 7.0% +/- 23.4% for the 25-OH-D3 form during the ICU stay. Patients who did not need invasive mechanical ventilation presented higher levels of 25-OH-D2 at baseline and follow-up. Lower 25-OH-D and 25-OH-D3 levels were associated with higher D-dimer at baseline (p = 0.003; p = 0.001) and at follow up (p = 0.029), higher procalcitonin levels (p = 0.002; p = 0.018) at follow up, and lower percentage lymphocyte counts (p = 0.044; p = 0.040) during ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: Deficient vitamin D status in critical patients was established at the admission and further worsened after three days of stay. Lower vitamin D levels were related to key altered clinical and biochemical parameters on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the different response of the 25-OH-D3 and 25-OH-D2 forms, it would be useful to monitor them on the evolution of the critically ill patient.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34205655	Carboxyhemoglobinemia in Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients. Carboxyhemoglobinemia is a common but a serious disorder, defined as an increase in carboxyhemoglobin level. Unfortunately, there are few data on carboxyhemoglobinemia in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate the incidence and etiologies of carboxyhemoglobinemia in COVID-19 patients and determine any association between carboxyhemoglobinemia and novel coronavirus infection. A retrospective chart review was performed at an academic medical center for all inpatient COVID-19 cases with either single or serial carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels from March 2020 through August 2020.Our study demonstrates that carboxyhemoglobinemia in COVID-19 patients is due to sepsis, hemolysis, and cytokine storm, triggered by the novel coronavirus infection sequela and is not directly from the virulence of novel coronavirus. Given the coexisting illnesses in critically ill COVID-19 patients, it is impossible to establish if coronavirus virulence was the culprit of elevated COHb levels. Moreover, our study found a high incidence of carboxyhemoglobinemia in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry can be inaccurate and unreliable; however, our study could not demonstrate any uniform results on the discrepancy between oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas. In this study, COHb levels were measured using a CO-oximeter. Therefore, we recommend monitoring the COHb level routinely in critically ill COVID-19 patients to allow more effective and prompt treatment.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34284575	Comprehensive O-Glycosylation Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein with Biomimetic Trp-Arg Materials. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious public health threat. Most vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 target the highly glycosylated spike protein (S). A good knowledge of the glycosylation profile of this protein is key to successful vaccine development. Unlike the 22 confirmed N-glycosylation sites on SARS-CoV-2 S, only a few O-glycosylation sites on this protein have been reported. This difference is mainly ascribed to the extremely low stoichiometry of O-glycosylation. Herein, we designed the biomimetic materials, Trp-Arg (WR) monomer-grafted silica microspheres (designated as WR-SiO2), and these biomimetic materials can enrich N- and O-linked glycopeptides with high selectivity. And WR-SiO2 can resist the nonglycopeptides' interference with the 100 molar fold of BSA during O-linked glycopeptide enrichment. We utilized WR-SiO2 to comprehensively analyze the O-glycosylation profile of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S. Twenty-seven O-glycosylation sites including 18 unambiguous sites are identified on SARS-CoV-2 S. Our study demonstrates that the biomimetic polymer can offer specific selectivity for O-linked glycopeptides and pave the way for O-glycosylation research in biological fields. The O-glycosylation profile of SARS-CoV-2 S might supplement the comprehensive glycosylation in addition to N-glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 S.	Mechanism;Treatment
34213435	Plausibility of a third wave of COVID-19 in India: A mathematical modelling based analysis. Background & objectives: : In the context of India's ongoing resurgence of COVID-19 (second wave since mid-February 2021, following the subsiding of the first wave in September 2020), there has been increasing speculation on the possibility of a future third wave of infection, posing a burden on the healthcare system. Using simple mathematical models of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, this study examined the conditions under which a serious third wave could occur. Methods: : Using a deterministic, compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, four potential mechanisms for a third wave were examined: (i) waning immunity restores previously exposed individuals to a susceptible state, (ii) emergence of a new viral variant that is capable of escaping immunity to previously circulating strains, (iii) emergence of a new viral variant that is more transmissible than the previously circulating strains, and (iv) release of current lockdowns affording fresh opportunities for transmission. Results: : Immune-mediated mechanisms (waning immunity, or viral evolution for immune escape) are unlikely to drive a severe third wave if acting on their own, unless such mechanisms lead to a complete loss of protection among those previously exposed. Likewise, a new, more transmissible variant would have to exceed a high threshold (R0>4.5) to cause a third wave on its own. However, plausible mechanisms for a third wave include: (i) a new variant that is more transmissible and at the same time capable of escaping prior immunity, and (ii) lockdowns that are highly effective in limiting transmission and subsequently released. In both cases, any third wave seems unlikely to be as severe as the second wave. Rapid scale-up of vaccination efforts could play an important role in mitigating these and future waves of the disease. Interpretation & conclusions: : This study demonstrates plausible mechanisms by which a substantial third wave could occur, while also illustrating that it is unlikely for any such resurgence to be as large as the second wave. Model projections are, however, subject to several uncertainties, and it remains important to scale up vaccination coverage to mitigate against any eventuality. Preparedness planning for any potential future wave will benefit by drawing upon the projected numbers based on the present modelling exercise.	Prevention;Transmission;Epidemic Forecasting
34372767	Clinical characteristics and a decision tree model to predict death outcome in severe COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads rapidly among people and causes a pandemic. It is of great clinical significance to identify COVID-19 patients with high risk of death. METHODS: A total of 2169 adult COVID-19 patients were enrolled from Wuhan, China, from February 10th to April 15th, 2020. Difference analyses of medical records were performed between severe and non-severe groups, as well as between survivors and non-survivors. In addition, we developed a decision tree model to predict death outcome in severe patients. RESULTS: Of the 2169 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 61 years and male patients accounted for 48%. A total of 646 patients were diagnosed as severe illness, and 75 patients died. An older median age and a higher proportion of male patients were found in severe group or non-survivors compared to their counterparts. Significant differences in clinical characteristics and laboratory examinations were found between severe and non-severe groups, as well as between survivors and non-survivors. A decision tree, including three biomarkers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein and lactic dehydrogenase, was developed to predict death outcome in severe patients. This model performed well both in training and test datasets. The accuracy of this model were 0.98 in both datasets. CONCLUSION: We performed a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 patients from the outbreak in Wuhan, China, and proposed a simple and clinically operable decision tree to help clinicians rapidly identify COVID-19 patients at high risk of death, to whom priority treatment and intensive care should be given.

34288910	"The introduction of a mandatory mask policy was associated with significantly reduced COVID-19 cases in a major metropolitan city. BACKGROUND: Whilst evidence of use of face masks in reducing COVID-19 cases is increasing, the impact of mandatory use across a large population has been difficult to assess. Introduction of mandatory mask use on July 22, 2020 during a resurgence of COVID-19 in Melbourne, Australia created a situation that facilitated an assessment of the impact of the policy on the epidemic growth rate as its introduction occurred in the absence of other changes to restrictions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Exponential epidemic growth or decay rates in daily COVID-19 diagnoses were estimated using a non-weighted linear regression of the natural logarithm of the daily cases against time, using a linear spline model with one knot (lspline package in R v 3.6.3). The model's two linear segments pivot around the hinge day, on which the mask policy began to take effect, 8 days following the introduction of the policy. We used two forms of data to assess change in mask usage: images of people wearing masks in public places obtained from a major media outlet and population-based survey data. Potential confounding factors (including daily COVID-19 tests, number of COVID-19 cases among population subsets affected differentially by the mask policy-e.g., healthcare workers) were examined for their impact on the results. Daily cases fitted an exponential growth in the first log-linear segment (k = +0.042, s.e. = 0.007), and fitted an exponential decay in the second (k = -0.023, s.e. = 0.017) log-linear segment. Over a range of reported serial intervals for SARS-CoV-2 infection, these growth rates correspond to a 22-33% reduction in an effective reproduction ratio before and after mandatory mask use. Analysis of images of people in public spaces showed mask usage rose from approximately 43% to 97%. Analysis of survey data found that on the third day before policy introduction, 44% of participants reported ""often"" or ""always"" wearing a mask; on the fourth day after, 100% reported ""always"" doing so. No potentially confounding factors were associated with the observed change in growth rates. CONCLUSIONS: The mandatory mask use policy substantially increased public use of masks and was associated with a significant decline in new COVID-19 cases after introduction of the policy. This study strongly supports the use of masks for controlling epidemics in the broader community."	Prevention
34217415	Impact of COVID-19 on cervical cancer screening: Challenges and opportunities to improving resilience and reduce disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic has a major impact on a wide range of health outcomes. Disruptions of elective health services related to cervical screening, management of abnormal screening test results, and treatment of precancers, may lead to increases in cervical cancer incidence and exacerbate existing health disparities. Modeling studies suggest that a short delay of cervical screening in subjects with previously negative HPV results has minor effects on cancer outcomes, while delay of management and treatment can lead to larger increases in cervical cancer. Several approaches can mitigate the effects of disruption of cervical screening and management. HPV-based screening has higher accuracy compared to cytology, and a negative HPV result provides longer reassurance against cervical cancer; further, HPV testing can be conducted from self-collected specimens. Self-collection expands the reach of screening to underserved populations who currently do not participate in screening. Self-collection and can also provide alternative screening approaches during the pandemic because testing can be supported by telehealth and specimens collected in the home, substantially reducing patient-provider contact and risk of COVID-19 exposure, and also expanding the reach of catch-up services to address backlogs of screening tests that accumulated during the pandemic. Risk-based management allows prioritizing management of patients at highest risk of cervical cancer while extending screening intervals for those at lowest risk. The pandemic provides important lessons for how to make cervical screening more resilient to disruptions and how to reduce cervical cancer disparities that may be exacerbated due to disruptions of health services.

34292175	Sepsis in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019: how often and how severe? PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss why severe COVID-19 should be considered sepsis and how co-infection and secondary infection can aggravate this condition and perpetuate organ dysfunction leading to high mortality rates. RECENT FINDINGS: In severe COVID-19, there is both direct viral toxicity and dysregulated host response to infection. Although both coinfection and/or secondary infection are present, the latest is of greater concern mainly in resource-poor settings. Patients with severe COVID-19 present a phenotype of multiorgan dysfunction that leads to death in an unacceptable high percentage of the patients, with wide variability around the world. Similarly to endemic sepsis, the mortality of COVID-19 critically ill patients is higher in low-income and middle-income countries as compared with high-income countries. Disparities, including hospital strain, resources limitations, higher incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAI), and staffing issues could in part explain this variability. SUMMARY: The high mortality rates of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 disease are not only related to the severity of patient disease but also to modifiable factors, such as the ICU strain, HAI incidence, and organizational aspects. Therefore, HAI prevention and the delivery of best evidence-based care for these patients to avoid additional damage is important. Quality improvement interventions might help in improving outcomes mainly in resource-limited settings.	Diagnosis;Treatment

34208640	Predictive Value of Comorbid Conditions for COVID-19 Mortality. In this paper, we aim at understanding the broad spectrum of factors influencing the survival of infected patients and the correlations between these factors to create a predictive probabilistic score for surviving the COVID-19 disease. Initially, 510 hospital admissions were counted in the study, out of which 310 patients did not survive. A prediction model was developed based on this data by using a Bayesian approach. Following the data collection process for the development study, the second cohort of patients totaling 541 was built to validate the risk matrix previously created. The final model has an area under the curve of 0.773 and predicts the mortality risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on nine disease groups while considering the gender and age of the patient as distinct risk groups. To ease medical workers' assessment of patients, we created a visual risk matrix based on a probabilistic model, ranging from a score of 1 (very low mortality risk) to 5 (very high mortality risk). Each score comprises a correlation between existing comorbid conditions, the number of comorbid conditions, gender, and age group category. This clinical model can be generalized in a hospital context and can be used to identify patients at high risk for whom immediate intervention might be required.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34347939	Evaluation of Immune Response and Disease Status in SLE Patients Following SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate seroreactivity and disease flares after COVID-19 vaccination in a multi-ethnic/racial cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: 90 SLE patients and 20 healthy controls receiving a complete COVID-19 vaccine regimen were included. IgG seroreactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization were used to evaluate B cell responses; IFN-gamma production to assess T cell responses was measured by ELISpot. Disease activity was measured by the hybrid SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) and flares were assigned by the SELENA/SLEDAI flare index. RESULTS: Overall, fully vaccinated SLE patients produced significantly lower IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD than controls. Twenty-six SLE patients (28.8%) generated an IgG response below that of the lowest control (<100 units/ml). In logistic regression analyses, the use of any immunosuppressant or prednisone and a normal anti-dsDNA level prior to vaccination associated with decreased vaccine responses. IgG seroreactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD strongly correlated with the SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization titers and antigen-specific IFN-gamma production determined by ELISpot. In a subset of patients with poor antibody responses, IFN-gamma production was likewise diminished. Pre-/post-vaccination SLEDAI scores were similar. Only 11.4% of patients had a post-vaccination flare; 1.3% were severe. CONCLUSION: In a multi-ethnic/racial study of SLE patients 29% had a low response to the COVID-19 vaccine which was associated with being on immunosuppression. Reassuringly, disease flares were rare. While minimal protective levels remain unknown, these data suggest protocol development is needed to assess efficacy of booster vaccination.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34200720	Specific Treatment Exists for SARS-CoV-2 ARDS. The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), seems to be difficult to overcome. A pandemic of such a scale has not been seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is respiratory disease, neurological manifestations and sequelae are increasingly being recognized. We observed a case series of rapid recovery of ARDS within 24 h in the preliminary clinical features of COVID-19 ARDS-associated neurological disease. It was also noted that by 15 April, 2021, there was no SARS-CoV-2 ARDS on Sorok Island in South Korea, where lepers had been living together. We compared each of dapsone's effects on humans and considered those of SARS-CoV-2. Dapsone showed different effects in the brain. The Sorokdo National Hospital reported a relationship between dapsone and the neuroinflammasome of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Sorok Island from January 2005 to June 2020. AD prevalence was low in the leprosy patient group who took dapsone regularly. The preliminary cross-sectional study of the trial group (22 subjects) and the control group (22 subjects) in the Hunt Regional Hospital reported the following results: The chi-square statistic is 5.1836. The p-value is 0.022801. The result is considered significant at p < 0.05. The results from the medical treatment from 21 December to 29 December 2020 were considered. The mortality rates at the ARDS onset stage were 0% with dapsone administered as a standard COVID-19 treatment and 40% without dapsone administered as a standard COVID-19 treatment, respectively. Based on the respiratory failure and sudden high death rate originating from the involvement of the brainstem, especially the pre-Botzinger complex, dapsone can be used to significantly reduce the incidence of the cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome and other illnesses caused by SARS-CoV-2.

34200070	Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, Symptom Profiles and Sero-Neutralization in a Suburban Area, France. The World Health Organisation recommends monitoring the circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We investigated anti-SARS-CoV-2 total immunoglobulin (IgT) antibody seroprevalence and in vitro sero-neutralization in Nancy, France, in spring 2020. Individuals were randomly sampled from electoral lists and invited with household members over 5 years old to be tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgT, i.e., IgA/IgG/IgM) antibodies by ELISA (Bio-rad); the sero-neutralization activity was evaluated on Vero CCL-81 cells. Among 2006 individuals, the raw seroprevalence was 2.1% (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 2.9), was highest for 20- to 34-year-old participants (4.7% (2.3 to 8.4)), within than out of socially deprived area (2.5% vs. 1%, p = 0.02) and with than without intra-family infection (p < 10(-6)). Moreover, 25% of participants presented at least one COVID-19 symptom associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (p < 10(-13)), with highly discriminant anosmia or ageusia (odds ratio 27.8 [13.9 to 54.5]); 16.3% (6.8 to 30.7) of seropositive individuals were asymptomatic. Positive sero-neutralization was demonstrated in vitro for 31/43 seropositive subjects. Regarding the very low seroprevalence, a preventive effect of the lockdown in March 2020 can be assumed for the summer, but a second COVID-19 wave, as expected, could be subsequently observed in this poorly immunized population.

34285024	Severe acquired haemophilia associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. A 65-year-old man presented with symptoms of severe subcutaneous bleeding in his arm, which led to compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy and massive blood transfusion protocol. Medical history was significant for history of autoimmune thyroid disease. Workup revealed elevated partial thromboplastin time, decreased factor VIII levels and elevated factor VIII inhibitor levels. He was worked up for causes of acquired haemophilia A and was found to have an elevated SARS-CoV-2 antibody level. Given his negative workup for other secondary aetiologies, we suspect that the cause of his haemophilia A was from his SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has been observed previously in various case reports.

34201490	The Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Weight Loss and Body Composition in Subjects with Overweight and Obesity Participating in a Nationwide Weight-Loss Program: Impact of a Remote Consultation Follow-Up-The CO-RNPC Study. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the nationwide total lockdown (LD) in France on weight loss and body composition modifications in subjects participating in a weight loss program and to evaluate the impact of remote consultations on participants' adherence to the weight loss program. The CO-RNPC study was a prospective multicentre cohort study including participants undergoing a two to six months program. The rate of weight loss in kg/week was computed before (15 days), during (99 days) and after LD (15 days). In the 1550 completing participants, body weight decreased from 87.1 kg [IQR 77.0; 100.2] to 82.3 kg [72.1; 94.3] resulting in a difference of -4.79 kg [-4.48; -5.10] (p < 0.01), with a corresponding reduction in waist circumference by 4 cm ([0; 9], p < 0.01). The median weight loss was 4.4 kg [0.5; 9.4] in those who used remote consultations, and 1.4 kg [0.8; 5.7] in the no remote consultation group (p < 0.01). In this large prospective cohort, we observed that the rate of weight loss was reduced during LD. This reduction was counterbalanced in participants involved in a remote consultation follow-up with a dose-effect response based on the number of remote consultations.	Prevention
34214015	Social Workers' Knowledge and Ability in Crisis Intervention in Kuwait- A Case of COVID-19. Summary: The main purpose of the current study was to assess whether there are significant differences among variables, such as social workers' familiarity with the crisis intervention model, receiving up-to-date information about the latest developments in COVID-19, having adequate information about what the symptoms of COVID-19 are, and willingness to work with COVID-19 patients, and social workers' ability to apply the crisis intervention model when they are working with clients and its three sub-scales (assessing and identifying the problem, establishing a relationship, and formulating an action plan). The cross-sectional survey method was used to conduct the sample of the study. The sample (N = 274) used in the study consisted of social workers in Kuwait.Findings: The results showed that CIS is valid and reliable and can be trusted to measure levels according to the purpose of the study. Analysis using T-test showed significant relationships between the CIS and study's variables at p < .05.Application: This study would help to raise the knowledge and awareness about the ability of social workers to apply the crisis intervention model during COVID-19 pandemic when they are working with clients and what variables may be associated with it.

34203643	Rapid Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 Variants by Continuous and Intermittent Irradiation with a Deep-Ultraviolet Light-Emitting Diode (DUV-LED) Device. More than 1 year has passed since social activities have been restricted due to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). More recently, novel SARS-CoV-2 variants have been spreading around the world, and there is growing concern that they may have higher transmissibility and that the protective efficacy of vaccines may be weaker against them. Immediate measures are needed to reduce human exposure to the virus. In this study, the antiviral efficacy of deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diode (DUV-LED) irradiation (280 +/- 5 nm, 3.75 mW/cm(2)) against three SARS-CoV-2 variants was evaluated. For the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variant strains, irradiation of the virus stocks for 1 s resulted in infectious titer reduction rates of 96.3%, 94.6%, and 91.9%, respectively, and with irradiation for 5 s, the rates increased to 99.9%, 99.9%, and 99.8%, respectively. We also tested the effect of pulsed DUV-LED irradiation (7.5 mW/cm(2), duty rate: 50%, frequency: 1 kHz) under the same output conditions as for continuous irradiation and found that the antiviral efficacy of pulsed and continuous irradiation was the same. These findings suggest that by further developing and optimizing the DUV-LED device to increase its output, it may be possible to instantly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 with DUV-LED irradiation.	Prevention
34217601	Use of face mask by blood donors during the COVID-19 pandemic: Impact on donor hemoglobin concentration: A bane or a boon. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 virus has caused the world's deadliest pandemic. Early April 2020, the Delhi Government made it compulsory for people to wear face masks while going outdoors to curb disease spread. Prolonged use of surgical masks during the pandemic has been reported to cause many adverse effects. Intermittent hypoxia has been shown to activate erythropoietin (EPO leading to increased hemoglobin mass. AIM: To analyze whether face mask induced intermittent hypoxia has any effect on the hemoglobin levels of healthy blood donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed donor data from 1st July 2019-31st December 2020 for hemoglobin distribution across hemoglobin ranges and donor deferral on basis of hemoglobin. Study population was divided into two cohorts Group 1- (1st July 2019-31 st March 2020): before implementation of mandatory face masks Group 2- (1st April 2020-31 st December 2020): after implementation of mandatory face masks RESULTS: Mean Hb of blood donors in Group 2 (15.01 +/- 1.1 g/dl) was higher than Group1 (14.49 +/- 1.15 g/dl), (p < 0.0001). 47.1 % group2 donors had Hb of 16.1-18 g/dl compared to group1 (38.4 %). 52.9 % group 2 donors had Hb between 12.5-15 g/dl compared to 61.6 % Group 1 (p < 0.05). Deferral due to anemia was lesser in group 2 compared to group 1 (p < 0.00001). Group 2 had significantly higher deferral due to high Hb (>18 gm/dl) was than Group 1 (p = 0.0039). CONCLUSION: This study including 19504 blood donors spanning over one and a half year shows that prolonged use of face mask by blood donors may lead to intermittent hypoxia and consequent increase in hemoglobin mass.

34227016	Risk factors for infection and mortality among hemodialysis patients during COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors for COVID-19 infection and mortality and to document if any relation exists between 25 (OH) Vitamin D and COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated 151 HD patients. Patients infected with COVID-19 were compared to patients without the infection. Risk factors for intensive care unit (ICU) stay and mortality were analyzed. Deceased infected patients were also compared to patients who died due to other causes. RESULTS: The mean age of all HD patients was 57.15 +/- 15.73 years and 51.7% were male. The mean 25 (OH) Vitamin D level of all patients was 16.48 +/- 8.45 ng/ml. Thirty-five infected patients were significantly older, had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score. They also had a higher number of patients with diabetic nephropathy, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and coronary heart disease (CHD). Patients who needed to stay in ICU had higher CCI score, a higher number of patients with diabetic nephropathy, pulmonary diseases and had statistically significantly higher CRP levels. Deceased infected patients were significantly older, had higher CCI scores and lower PTH than survived infected patients. Deceased infected patients had lower PTH, but had significantly lower leukocyte, lymphocyte counts and urea levels at admission when compared to patients who died due to other causes. Patients with poor prognosis had lower neutrophil and lymphocyte counts before infection and at admission; respectively. 25 (OH) Vitamin D level was not related to the risk of COVID-19 infection, ICU stay or mortality. CONCLUSION: Older age, higher CCI scores, diabetic nephropathy, CHD, CVA, pulmonary diseases, and lower neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were found as poor prognostic factors. The comparisons yielded no significant finding for 25 (OH) Vitamin D, acetylsalicylic acid, erythropoietin, intravenous iron, ACEI, ARBs, and dialysis adequacy parameters.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34290962	Guillain-Barre syndrome 15 days after COVID-19 despite SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) following a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been repeatedly observed but GBS following a SARS-CoV-2 infection in a vaccinated patient has not been reported. A 69yo female developed paresthesias of both lower and upper limbs which were followed by progressive muscle weakness. The history was positive for a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection 15 days earlier. COVID-19 occurred despite a first dose of a vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 40 days prior to onset of GBS. Since CSF investigations and nerve conduction studies were indicative of GBS, subtype acute, inflammatory, demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), immunoglobulins (30 g/d) were started. After two weeks complete recovery was achieved. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infections may develop despite full vaccination and may be complicated by GBS. Since no other trigger of GBS could be identified, a causal relation between the SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS was suspected.	Case Report
34208729	From Isolation to Containment: Perceived Fear of Infectivity and Protective Behavioral Changes during the COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign. In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, maintenance of protective behavior is a continued challenge in the effort to contain the spread of the virus. A cross-sectional study via an internet questionnaire was utilized to elucidate changes in compliance to protective behavior among the Israeli population (n = 1120), after the beginning of the vaccination campaign. Comparison was made between individuals who were previously infected with the virus, those who received one dose of inoculation with the vaccine, and individuals that were neither infected or vaccinated. The study results indicate that those who were previously infected with the COVID-19 virus were less careful about mask wearing (18.8%) and social distancing (29.7%), as compared to the other examined groups (regarding mask wearing, 8.2% and 11.6% respectively, and with regard to social distancing 12.8% and 19.2%), and may require targeted risk communication campaigns to address this population. Furthermore, the study revealed that those that were non-Jewish (as compared to Jewish study counterparts) or that were older (19+) were more vigilant in their protective behavior (29.6% vs. 11.2% respectively for social distancing and 29.6% vs. 11.1% respectively for mask wearing). Despite a successful initial vaccination campaign in Israel, public health officials need to engage all members of the public to unremittingly observe compliance to directed health guidelines, to ensure that the results of previous governmental efforts in fighting the pandemic (such as lockdowns) will be effectively sustained, and the road to containment will be hastened.

34340537	Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Proteins in Cell Entry: Control Elements in the Amino-Terminal Domains. Selective pressures drive adaptive changes in the coronavirus spike proteins directing virus-cell entry. These changes are concentrated in the amino-terminal domains (NTDs) and the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of complex modular spike protein trimers. The impact of this hypervariability on virus entry is often unclear, particularly with respect to sarbecovirus NTD variations. Therefore, we constructed indels and substitutions within hypervariable NTD regions and used severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus-like particles and quantitative virus-cell entry assays to elucidate spike structures controlling this initial infection stage. We identified NTD variations that increased SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated membrane fusion and cell entry. Increased cell entry correlated with greater presentation of RBDs to ACE2 receptors. This revealed a significant allosteric effect, in that changes within the NTDs can orient RBDs for effective virus-cell binding. Yet, those NTD changes elevating receptor binding and membrane fusion also reduced interdomain associations, leaving spikes on virus-like particles susceptible to irreversible inactivation. These findings parallel those obtained decades ago, in which comparisons of murine coronavirus spike protein variants established inverse relationships between membrane fusion potential and virus stability. Considerable hypervariability in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein NTDs also appear to be driven by counterbalancing pressures for effective virus-cell entry and durable extracellular virus infectivity. These forces may selectively amplify SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. IMPORTANCE Adaptive changes that increase SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility may expand and prolong the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Transmission requires metastable and dynamic spike proteins that bind viruses to cells and catalyze virus-cell membrane fusion. Using newly developed assays reflecting these two essential steps in virus-cell entry, we focused on adaptive changes in SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and found that deletions in amino-terminal domains reset spike protein metastability, rendering viruses less stable yet more poised to respond to cellular factors that prompt entry and subsequent infection. The results identify adjustable control features that balance extracellular virus stability with facile virus dynamics during cell entry. These equilibrating elements warrant attention when monitoring the evolution of pandemic coronaviruses.	Mechanism;Transmission
34282406	Remdesivir Versus Standard-of-Care for Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection: An Analysis of 28-Day Mortality. Background: Remdesivir is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been shown to shorten time to recovery and improve clinical outcomes in randomized trials. Methods: This was the final day 28 comparative analysis of data from a phase 3, randomized, open-label study comparing 2 remdesivir regimens (5 vs 10 days, combined for this analysis [remdesivir cohort]) and a real-world retrospective longitudinal cohort study of patients receiving standard-of-care treatment (nonremdesivir cohort). Eligible patients, aged >/=18 years, had confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), oxygen saturation </=94% on room air or required supplemental oxygen, with pulmonary infiltrates. Propensity score matching (up to 1:10 ratio) was used to ensure comparable populations. We assessed day 14 clinical recovery (determined using a 7-point ordinal scale) and day 28 all-cause mortality (coprimary endpoints). Results: A total of 368 (remdesivir) and 1399 (nonremdesivir) patients were included in the matched analysis. The day 14 clinical recovery rate was significantly higher among the remdesivir versus the nonremdesivir cohort (65.2% vs 57.1%; odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.90; P = 0.002). The day 28 mortality rate was significantly lower in the remdesivir cohort versus the nonremdesivir cohort (12.0% vs 16.2%; OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-.95; P = .03). Conclusions: Remdesivir was associated with significantly higher rates of day 14 clinical recovery, and lower day 28 mortality, compared with standard-of-care treatment in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. These data, taken together, support the use of remdesivir to improve clinical recovery and decrease mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Treatment
34223494	Health Care Workers' Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs Related to COVID-19 in Palliative Medicine and Hospice Care. Background: Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted on a global scale, the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of the health care workers who provide the care at the end of life have not been evaluated. Objectives: To assess and understand palliative medicine and hospice care health care workers' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs related to COVID-19. Design: A web-based survey was created. Primary outcomes included attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge. Secondary outcomes included comparison in between health care workers who described themselves at high risk versus not at high risk of complications related to COVID-19 infection. Setting/Subjects: In total, 1262 adult hospice workers in the United States were invited. Results: A total of 348 workers completed the survey. Of them, 321 were analyzed, 54.52% were over the age of 50 years, 84.74% were females, 41.75% were nurses, 29.6% were administrative staff, and 6.54% were physicians. Of these workers, 39.56% considered themselves at high risk to develop complications related to COVID-19 infection, 74.46% felt neutral to uncomfortable treating these patients, 77.57% believed that the recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) was adequate, 89.41% supported the risk-reduction strategies, 84.73% obtained information from health authorities, 25.55% from social media, 31.46% believed COVID-19 was likely created in a laboratory or intentionally, and 66.14% of hospice workers who considered themselves at high risk of complications felt available PPE was adequate to protect them compared with 85.05% of responders who did not consider themselves at high risk (p < 0.0001). The majority of respondents were incorrect in seven of the eight clinical scenarios. Conclusion: Improving staff knowledge and information related to COVID-19 would enhance staff safety, improve patient care, and relieve anxiety.	Prevention
34334918	Probable vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from mother to neonate. The pandemic spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has affected 188 countries and territories. Altered physiological status during pregnancy makes a mother vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus may be transmitted from mother to baby during antenatal period or postnatal period. Although the primary mode of transmission of the virus is by respiratory droplets, there is emerging evidence of in utero transmission from mother to foetus. In this rare case report, we describe one such episode of probable vertical transmission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second systematically investigated Indian case, indicating in utero transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to foetus.	Case Report
34283832	Spatially resolved simulations of the spread of COVID-19 in three European countries. We explore the spatial and temporal spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus under containment measures in three European countries based on fits to data of the early outbreak. Using data from Spain and Italy, we estimate an age dependent infection fatality ratio for SARS-CoV-2, as well as risks of hospitalization and intensive care admission. We use them in a model that simulates the dynamics of the virus using an age structured, spatially detailed agent based approach, that explicitly incorporates governmental interventions and changes in mobility and contact patterns occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak in each country. Our simulations reproduce several of the features of its spatio-temporal spread in the three countries studied. They show that containment measures combined with high density are responsible for the containment of cases within densely populated areas, and that spread to less densely populated areas occurred during the late stages of the first wave. The capability to reproduce observed features of the spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 makes this model a potential candidate for forecasting the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in other settings, and we recommend its application in low and lower-middle income countries which remain understudied.

34202257	Recent Progress in Metabolic Syndrome Research and Therapeutics. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a well-defined yet difficult-to-manage disease entity. Both the precipitous rise in its incidence due to contemporary lifestyles and the growing heterogeneity among affected populations present unprecedented challenges. Moreover, the predisposed risk for developing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in populations with MetS, and the viral impacts on host metabolic parameters, underscores the need to investigate this mechanism thoroughly. Recent investigations of metabolomics and proteomics have revealed not only differentially expressed substances in MetS, but also the consequences of diet consumption and physical activity on energy metabolism. These variations in metabolites, as well as protein products, also influence a wide spectrum of host characteristics, from cellular behavior to phenotype. Research on the dysregulation of gut microbiota and the resultant inflammatory status has also contributed to our understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. As for state-of-the-art therapies, advancing depictions of the bio-molecular landscape of MetS have emerged and now play a key role in individualized precision medicine. Fecal microbiota transplantation, aiming to restore the host's homeostasis, and targeting of the bile acid signaling pathway are two approaches to combatting MetS. Comprehensive molecular inquiries about MetS by omics measures are mandatory to facilitate the development of novel therapeutic modalities.	Mechanism;Treatment
34284644	Preferences Toward COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing Features: Results From a National Cross-Sectional Survey. PURPOSE: Describe preferences toward COVID-19 testing features (method, location, hypothetical monetary incentive) and simulate the effect of monetary incentives on willingness to test. DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey administered in July 2020. SUBJECTS: 1,505 nationally representative U.S. respondents. MEASURES: Choice of preferred COVID-19 testing options in discrete choice experiment. Options differed by method (nasal-swab, saliva), location (hospital/clinic, drive-through, at-home), and monetary incentive ($0, $10, $20). ANALYSIS: Latent class conditional logit model to classify preferences, mixed logit model to simulate incentive effectiveness. RESULTS: Preferences were categorized into 4 groups: 34% (n = 517) considered testing comfort (saliva versus nasal swab) most important, 27% (n = 408) were willing to trade comfort for monetary incentives, 19% (n = 287) would only test at convenient locations, 20% (n = 293) avoided testing altogether. Relative to no monetary incentives, incentives of $100 increased the percent of testing avoiders (16%) and convenience seekers (70%) that were willing to test. CONCLUSION: Preferences toward different COVID-19 testing features vary, highlighting the need to match testing features with individuals to monitor the spread of COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34290789	Risk of Covid-19 infection during endoscopy: Efficacy of personal protective equipment (PPE) in protecting health professionals. Objectives: To correlate compliance to personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols and risk of exposure to SARS-COV-2 infection in endoscopy staff. Methods: We included 85 endoscopic procedures performed at Lahore General Hospital from May to July 2020. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) were implemented for patient selection, risk stratification and personal protective equipment (PPE) use for endoscopy staff. Patient and endoscopy staff were followed for Covid-19 infection. PPE scores for staff and Covid-19 positivity on follow-up were correlated using student's t test. Results: Following 85 procedures included, 2 (2.3%) patients became Covid-19 positive. PPE score was <9 in 5 (5.8%) procedures for endoscopist and Covid-19 developed in 2 (2.3%) of them, PPE score was <9 during 19 (22.3%) procedures in 1(st) assistant and 9 (10.5%) developed infection and for 2(nd) assistant PPE score was <9 in 19(22.3%) endoscopies and 5 (5.9%) tested positive for covid-19. Infectivity of endoscopy staff was 6.2%. Association between PPE score and risk of Covid-19 was not significant. (p value 0.51 for endoscopist, 0.10 for 1(st) assistant and 0.09 for 2(nd) assistant). Conclusion: Compliance of SOPs for infection control reduces risk of acquiring Covid-19 infection during endoscopy. Proper use of PPE is effective for safety of endoscopy staff.	Prevention
34200249	Reversion of Gut Microbiota during the Recovery Phase in Patients with Asymptomatic or Mild COVID-19: Longitudinal Study. Patients with COVID-19 have been reported to experience gastrointestinal symptoms as well as respiratory symptoms, but the effects of COVID-19 on the gut microbiota are poorly understood. We explored gut microbiome profiles associated with the respiratory infection of SARS-CoV-2 during the recovery phase in patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. A longitudinal analysis was performed using the same patients to determine whether the gut microbiota changed after recovery from COVID-19. We applied 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to analyze two paired fecal samples from 12 patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Fecal samples were selected at two time points: during SARS-CoV-2 infection (infected state) and after negative conversion of the viral RNA (recovered state). We also compared the microbiome data with those from 36 healthy controls. Microbial evenness of the recovered state was significantly increased compared with the infected state. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the depletion of Bacteroidetes, while an abundance was observed with a tendency to rapidly reverse in the recovered state. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the infected state was markedly higher than that in the recovered state. Gut dysbiosis was observed after infection even in patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, while the composition of the gut microbiota was recovered after negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Modifying intestinal microbes in response to COVID-19 might be a useful therapeutic alternative.	Treatment
34219532	Acute Myocardial Injury Following COVID-19 Vaccination: A Case Report and Review of Current Evidence from Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System Database. COVID-19 vaccination related adverse events is an evolving field. Here we present a case of acute myocardial injury that developed as a result of an acute immune response following the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination (Moderna) in a 67-year-old man who presented in acute congestive heart failure. His clinical course improved over 3 days. Review of the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites identified 37 vaccine recipients who developed myocarditis as an adverse event following COVID-19 vaccination. With the mass expansion of COVID-19 vaccine administration, physicians need to be vigilant about the possibility of new adverse events.	Case Report
34209237	Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin Treatment of Hospitalized Patients Infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Senegal from March to October 2020. As of today, little data is available on COVID-19 in African countries, where the case management relied mainly on a treatment by association between hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM). This study aimed to understand the main clinical outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients in Senegal from March to October 20202. We described the clinical characteristics of patients and analysed clinical status (alive and discharged versus hospitalized or died) at 15 days after Isolation and Treatment Centres (ITC) admission among adult patients who received HCQ plus AZM and those who did not receive this combination. A total of 926 patients were included in this analysis. Six hundred seventy-four (674) (72.8%) patients received a combination of HCQ and AZM. Results showed that the proportion of patient discharge at D15 was significantly higher for patients receiving HCQ plus AZM (OR: 1.63, IC 95% (1.09-2.43)). Factors associated with a lower proportion of patients discharged alive were: age >/= 60 years (OR: 0.55, IC 95% (0.36-0.83)), having of at least one pre-existing disorder (OR: 0.61, IC 95% (0.42-0.90)), and a high clinical risk at admission following NEWS score (OR: 0.49, IC 95% (0.28-0.83)). Few side effects were reported including 2 cases of cardiac rhythmic disorders in the HCQ and AZM group versus 13 in without HCQ + AZM. An improvement of clinical status at 15 days was found for patients exposed to HCQ plus AZM combination.	Treatment
34336549	Evaluation and Management of Alcohol use Disorder among Older Adults. Purpose of Review: The prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) among older adults in the United States is rising, but remains underdiagnosed, underreported, and inadequately managed. This review highlights the medical, social, and cultural factors of AUD in older adults and provides guidelines for its screening, evaluation, and management. Recent Findings: The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional challenges and barriers to care, as older adults may have disproportionate worsening of anxiety, depression, and substance use resulting from increased isolation related to physical distancing and shelter-in-place guidelines. Summary: All older adults should be routinely screened for AUD with standardized screening tools. If a patient's screening results are positive, a clinician should conduct a brief assessment, which may be supplemented by laboratory tests. Most older adults at risk for alcohol misuse do not need specialized SUD treatment, but most can benefit from Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) to prevent substance misuse before it occurs. Medications for the treatment of AUD in older adults include naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram, gabapentin and topiramate. Psychosocial treatments, including mutual help groups, are equally important.	Prevention
34203108	Green-Blue Spaces and Population Density versus COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in Poland. In the last year, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, scientific papers have appeared in which the authors are trying to identify factors (including environmental) favoring the spread of this disease. This paper presents the spatial differentiation in the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths during the full year (March 2020-March 2021) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Poland versus green-blue spaces (green-i.a. forests, orchards, meadows and pastures, recreational and rest areas, biologically active arable land; blue-lakes and artificial water reservoirs, rivers, ecological areas and internal waters) and population density. The analysis covers 380 counties, including 66 cities. This study used daily reports on the progress of the pandemic in Poland published by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Poland and unique, detailed data on 24 types of land use available in the Statistics Poland database. Statistical relationships were determined between the above-mentioned environmental variables and the variables characterizing COVID-19 (cases and deaths). Various basic types of regression models were analysed. The optimal model was selected, and the determination coefficient, significance level and the values of the parameters of these relationships, together with the estimation error, were calculated. The obtained results indicated that the higher the number of green-blue spaces in individual counties, the lower the total number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. These relationships were described by logarithmic and homographic models. In turn, an increase in the population density caused an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths, according to the power model. These results can be used in the current analysis of the spread of the pandemic, including the location of potential outbreaks. In turn, the developed models can be used as a tool in forecasting the development of the pandemic and making decisions about the implementation of preventive measures.	Prevention
34220870	Declining Levels of Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 in Convalescent COVID-19 Patients One Year Post Symptom Onset. Major advances have been made in understanding the dynamics of humoral immunity briefly after the acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, knowledge concerning long-term kinetics of antibody responses in convalescent patients is limited. During a one-year period post symptom onset, we longitudinally collected 162 samples from 76 patients and quantified IgM and IgG antibodies recognizing the nucleocapsid (N) protein or the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S). After one year, approximately 90% of recovered patients still had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies recognizing N and RBD-S. Intriguingly, neutralizing activity was only detectable in ~43% of patients. When neutralization tests against the E484K-mutated variant of concern (VOC) B.1.351 (initially identified in South Africa) were performed among patients who neutralize the original virus, the capacity to neutralize was even further diminished to 22.6% of donors. Despite declining N- and S-specific IgG titers, a considerable fraction of recovered patients had detectable neutralizing activity one year after infection. However, neutralizing capacities, in particular against an E484K-mutated VOC were only detectable in a minority of patients one year after symptomatic COVID-19. Our findings shed light on the kinetics of long-term immune responses after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and argue for vaccinations of individuals who experienced a natural infection to protect against emerging VOC.

34200979	Lockdown-Related Disparities Experienced by People with Disabilities during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Scoping Review with Thematic Analysis. People with disabilities may be disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We synthesize the literature on broader health and social impacts on people with disabilities arising from lockdown-related measures. METHODS: Scoping review with thematic analysis. Up to mid-September 2020, seven scientific databases and three pre-print servers were searched to identify empirical or perspective papers addressing lockdown-related disparities experienced by people with disabilities. Snowballing searches and experts' consultation also occurred. Two independent reviewers took eligibility decisions and performed data extractions. RESULTS: Out of 1026 unique references, 85 addressed lockdown-related disparities experienced by people with disabilities. Ten primary and two central themes were identified: (1) Disrupted access to healthcare (other than for COVID-19); (2) Reduced physical activity leading to health and functional decline; (3) From physical distance and inactivity to social isolation and loneliness; (4) Disruption of personal assistance and community support networks; (5) Children with disabilities disproportionally affected by school closures; (6) Psychological consequences of disrupted routines, activities, and support; (7) Family and informal caregiver burden and stress; (8) Risks of maltreatment, violence, and self-harm; (9) Reduced employment and/or income exacerbating disparities; and (10) Digital divide in access to health, education, and support services. Lack of disability-inclusive response and emergency preparedness and structural, pre-pandemic disparities were the central themes. CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown-related measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic can disproportionally affect people with disabilities with broader impact on their health and social grounds. Lack of disability-inclusive response and emergency preparedness and pre-pandemic disparities created structural disadvantages, exacerbated during the pandemic. Both structural disparities and their pandemic ramifications require the development and implementation of disability-inclusive public health and policy measures.	Prevention
34281005	Facemasks: A Looming Microplastic Crisis. Single-use disposable facemasks have been used as a preventive measure against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, many researchers have found evidence that these facemasks are being dumped into lakes, rivers, and open garbage dumps. Facemasks have the potential of releasing microplastic fibers into the environment; a phenomenon that has been poorly investigated. Moreover, microplastic fibers composed of plastics have the potential of affecting the flora and fauna of many ecosystems. In this preliminary study, we investigate how many microplastic fibers had been released to the water by KF-AD, KF94, surgical, and FFP1 standard facemasks, which are the most widely available facemask standards in South Korea. The waterbody in our research was mechanically agitated for 24, 48, and 72 h. Findings showed that most of the layers of facemasks are composed of polypropylene. The surgical and KF94 standard facemasks released the highest number of microplastic fibers. Furthermore, under our research conditions, a single facemask can release at least 47 microplastic fibers per day (e.g., KF-AD standard mask), which can lead to the release of at least 1381 million microplastic fibers per day in total in South Korea if 70% of the urban population uses a single mask every day. Moreover, the released microplastic fibers significantly increased when the agitation time extended from 24 to 48 h. This finding suggests that the number of released microplastic fibers is likely to increase drastically.	Prevention
34291023	Risk Factors for SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Pneumonia, Intubation, and Death in Northeast Mexico. Despite the social distancing and mobility restriction measures implemented for susceptible people around the world, infections and deaths due to COVID-19 continued to increase, even more so in the first months of 2021 in Mexico. Thus, it is necessary to find risk groups that can benefit from more aggressive preventive measures in a high-density population. This is a case-control study of suspected COVID-19 patients from Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Cases were: (1) COVID-19-positive patients and COVID-19-positive patients who (2) developed pneumonia, (3) were intubated and (4) died. Controls were: (1) COVID-19-negative patients, (2) COVID-19-positive patients without pneumonia, (3) non-intubated COVID-19-positive patients and (4) surviving COVID-19-positive patients. >/= 18 years of age, not pregnant, were included. The pre-existing conditions analysed as risk factors were age (years), sex (male), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, immunosuppression, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and smoking. The Mann-Whitney U tests, Chi square and binary logistic regression were used. A total of 56,715 suspected patients were analysed in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, with 62.6% being positive for COVID-19 and, of those infected, 14% developed pneumonia, 2.9% were intubated and 8.1% died. The mean age of those infected was 44.7 years, while of those complicated it was around 60 years. Older age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity were risk factors for infection, complications, and death from COVID-19. This study highlights the importance of timely recognition of the population exposed to pre-existing conditions to prioritise preventive measures against the virus.	Diagnosis;Prevention;Treatment
34211491	N-Glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain Is Important for Functional Expression in Plants. Nicotiana benthamiana is used worldwide as production host for recombinant proteins. Many recombinant proteins such as monoclonal antibodies, growth factors or viral antigens require posttranslational modifications like glycosylation for their function. Here, we transiently expressed different variants of the glycosylated receptor binding domain (RBD) from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in N. benthamiana. We characterized the impact of variations in RBD-length and posttranslational modifications on protein expression, yield and functionality. We found that a truncated RBD variant (RBD-215) consisting of amino acids Arg319-Leu533 can be efficiently expressed as a secreted soluble protein. Purified RBD-215 was mainly present as a monomer and showed binding to the conformation-dependent antibody CR3022, the cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and to antibodies present in convalescent sera. Expression of RBD-215 in glycoengineered DeltaXT/FT plants resulted in the generation of complex N-glycans on both N-glycosylation sites. While site-directed mutagenesis showed that the N-glycans are important for proper RBD folding, differences in N-glycan processing had no effect on protein expression and function.

34208672	Tracheostomy Timing and Outcome in Severe COVID-19: The WeanTrach Multicenter Study. BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy can be performed safely in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, little is known about the optimal timing, effects on outcome, and complications. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, observational study. This study included 153 tracheostomized COVID-19 patients from 11 intensive care units (ICUs). The primary endpoint was the median time to tracheostomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Secondary endpoints were survival rate, length of ICU stay, and post-tracheostomy complications, stratified by tracheostomy timing (early versus late) and technique (surgical versus percutaneous). RESULTS: The median time to tracheostomy was 15 (1-64) days. There was no significant difference in survival between critically ill COVID-19 patients who received tracheostomy before versus after day 15, nor between surgical and percutaneous techniques. ICU length of stay was shorter with early compared to late tracheostomy (p < 0.001) and percutaneous compared to surgical tracheostomy (p = 0.050). The rate of lower respiratory tract infections was higher with surgical versus percutaneous technique (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill patients with COVID-19, neither early nor percutaneous tracheostomy improved outcomes, but did shorten ICU stay. Infectious complications were less frequent with percutaneous than surgical tracheostomy.	Treatment
34221160	Asthma in Pregnancy. Review of Current Literature and Recommendations. Background:Asthma is the most common respiratory disorder affecting women during pregnancy. Although it is a reversible disease, it may adversely affect maternal quality of life and perinatal outcomes, especially in severe and inappropriately managed cases. Conversely, pregnancy influences the course of asthma through the physiological respiratory, hormonal, and immune system changes. Exacerbations are a key feature of asthma, representing a significant problem if severe, requiring aggressive medical intervention, hospital and even ICU admission. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to summarize the current knowledge and to provide a comprehensive overview of asthma in pregnancy. We also want rising awareness among patients and clinicians on the importance of proper asthma management during pregnancy. Data sources: A comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Medline, and Taylor& Francis was performed. We have searched for review articles as well as prospective and retrospective studies published in English, investigating the bilateral relationship between asthma and pregnancy, using the key words mentioned bellow. Manual search through both national and international guidelines as well as relevant journals and publications on the topic has been also conducted. Conclusion:Optimal asthma control, preventing, detecting, and treating the exacerbations are of the utmost importance to minimize the adverse effects for both the mother and fetus/neonate. Guidelines recommend active asthma management during pregnancy. Strong support prior and throughout the pregnancy and individualized treatment, guided by a multidisciplinary team, is suggested. Education on the importance of anti-asthmatic therapy, avoiding triggers, frequent and accurate monitoring are essential for good asthma management. Considering the pandemic, we are facing and the potential impact of COVID-19 on asthma, Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guideline recommendations for physicians are mentioned in the present article.

34205898	Pancreatic Injury after COVID-19 Vaccine-A Case Report. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 3 million deaths worldwide. Recently developed genetically engineered vaccines are the most critical solution for controlling the pandemic. Clinical trials on a large number of participants confirmed their safety and efficacy. However, with the growing number of vaccinated people, new infrequent adverse effects have been reported, not described in the medicinal product characteristics. We would like to report a case of acute pancreatic injury that occurred shortly after administering Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty). The report points out the potential need for close monitoring of patients reporting abdominal pain after vaccination (unresponsive to standard oral painkillers) because such symptom can be associated with acute pancreatitis.

34212441	Dynamic assessment of the risk of airborne viral infection. This paper applies the Rudnick and Milton method through the dynamic evaluation of the probability of airborne contagion, redefining all parameters and variables in discretized form. To adapt the calculation of the risk of contagion to real needs, scenarios are used to define the presence of people, infected subjects, the hourly production of the quanta of infection, and the calculation of the concentration of CO2 produced by exhalation in the air. Three case studies are discussed: a school, an office, a commercial activity. Complex scenarios include environmental sanitization, a variable number of people, and the possibility of simulating work shifts. The dynamic evaluation of the quanta of infection is also estimated, not foreseen by the Rudnick and Milton model, and involves updating the average values of the equivalent fraction of the indoor air with an improvement in the accuracy of the calculation due to the reduction of improper peaks of the stationary variables.

34332847	How to manage patients with suspected upper tract urothelial carcinoma in the pandemic of COVID-19? BACKGROUND: The pandemic of COVID-19 has disrupted the clinical pathway for patients with suspected upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). This aims to investigate the optimal management of UTUC during the pandemic by determining 1) Whether a three-month delay of RNU leads to worsened overall survival, 2) Whether radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) can be performed without prior diagnostic ureteroscopy (URS). METHODS: Consecutive patients with RNU performed for suspected UTUC in four hospitals in Hong Kong and Taiwan were included. Patients with histologically proven UTUC and with RNU performed within one year were dichotomized into early (</=3 months) and delayed (>3 months) RNU groups. Diagnostic performances of predictive models based on pre-URS factors (gross haematuria, suspicious or malignant urine cytology, and filling defect or contrast-enhancing mass on computed tomography), with or without URS, were analysed using receiver operating characteristics and area under curve (AUC). Overall survival was analysed using Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2019, 665 patients underwent RNU, and 491 of them had prior diagnostic URS. The early RNU group had a better overall survival (P=0.015). Early RNU was associated with a better overall survival upon multivariate analysis (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.03-2.33, P=0.035). Large tumour size, multi-focal tumour, T2 or above disease, and positive nodal status were associated with a poorer overall survival. A combination of any 2 out of the 3 pre-URS factors achieved a positive predictive value of 99.5 to 100%. Presence of all 3 pre-URS factors achieved an AUC of 0.851 with URS, and AUC of 0.809 without URS. CONCLUSIONS: A delay of RNU for over 3 months was associated with poorer overall survival and has to be avoided despite the current COVID-19. We can also consider direct RNU based on clinical factors alone. This also avoids URS hospitalization and expedites the clinical pathway of UTUC.	Prevention
34221305	The influence of delayed treatment due to COVID-19 on patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. Purpose: To explore the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the prognosis of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), and share the experience in managing them during pandemics. Method: This is a retrospective study of nAMD and PCV patients treated at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 31 December 2019 to 1 August 2020. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), optical coherence tomography (OCT) features, duration of delayed treatment and number of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections were analyzed. Results: A total of 130 nAMD patients (155 eyes) and 76 PCV patients (89 eyes) were identified. Compared to the conditions before COVID-19, the BCVA of delayed cases decreased significantly, and the proportion of patients presenting with sub-macular scar was significantly greater in the delayed treatment group (p < 0.05). The BCVA of non-delayed cases remained stable, with the percentage of patients with disease activity sub-retinal fluid and hemorrhage at the fovea decreasing significantly (p < 0.05). The stable cases who did not require anti-VEGF treatment had significantly worse baseline and final BCVA, these patients were likely to be chronic and 'burnt out' cases with significantly worse anatomical structures (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The delayed cases due to the pandemic suffered compromised visual function and a higher rate of sub-macular scar formation, while the visual function of non-delayed cases remained stable with favorable anatomical outcomes, suggesting the importance of regular follow-up for nAMD and PCV patients. Besides, effective measures of hospitals during pandemics are crucial to provide timely treatment for chronic disease.	Prevention
34288955	Predictors of COVID-19 in an outpatient fever clinic. BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to identify clinical risk factors for COVID-19 in a German outpatient fever clinic that allow distinction of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from other patients with flu-like symptoms. METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-centre cohort study. Patients were included visiting the fever clinic from 4th of April 2020 to 15th of May 2020. Symptoms, comorbidities, and socio-demographic factors were recorded in a standardized fashion. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of COVID-19, on the bases of those a model discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver operation curves (AUROC). RESULTS: The final analysis included 930 patients, of which 74 (8%) had COVID-19. Anosmia (OR 10.71; CI 6.07-18.9) and ageusia (OR 9.3; CI 5.36-16.12) were strongly associated with COVID-19. High-risk exposure (OR 12.20; CI 6.80-21.90), especially in the same household (OR 4.14; CI 1.28-13.33), was also correlated; the more household members, especially with flu-like symptoms, the higher the risk of COVID-19. Working in an essential workplace was also associated with COVID-19 (OR 2.35; CI 1.40-3.96), whereas smoking was inversely correlated (OR 0.19; CI 0.08-0.44). A model that considered risk factors like anosmia, ageusia, concomitant of symptomatic household members and smoking well discriminated COVID-19 patients from other patients with flu-like symptoms (AUROC 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: We report a set of four readily available clinical parameters that allow the identification of high-risk individuals of COVID-19. Our study will not replace molecular testing but will help guide containment efforts while waiting for test results.	Diagnosis
34221896	Acute rhabdomyolysis in a young woman with moderate COVID-19. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is having serious medical, social, and economic impacts worldwide. COVID-19 may lead to a variety of complications, including rhabdomyolysis. Although rhabdomyolysis is a rare complication, it can lead to severe kidney damage. Recent studies suggest that rhabdomyolysis caused by SARS-CoV-2 is more common in middle-aged and older men with severe COVID-19. Herein we report a case of rhabdomyolysis in a young woman with moderate COVID-19. She had a habit of muscle training. She presented with moderate COVID-19 and acute rhabdomyolysis that required a large volume of fluid infusion in addition to dexamethasone and remdesivir. Clinicians should pay attention to the development of rhabdomyolysis in patients with COVID-19, especially those with a habit of strenuous exercise or muscle training, even if they are young and have moderate COVID-19.

34208061	Multi-Epitope Vaccine Design Using an Immunoinformatic Approach for SARS-CoV-2. Through 4 June 2021, COVID-19 has caused over 172.84 million cases of infection and 3.71 million deaths worldwide. Due to its rapid dissemination and high mutation rate, it is essential to develop a vaccine harboring multiple epitopes and efficacious against multiple variants to prevent the immune escape of SARS-CoV-2. An in silico approach based on the viral genome was applied to identify 19 high-immunogenic B-cell epitopes and 499 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted T-cell epitopes. Thirty multi-epitope peptide vaccines were designed by iNeo-Suite and manufactured by solid-phase synthesis. Docking analysis confirmed stable hydrogen bonds of epitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. When four peptide candidates derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were selected to immunize mice, a significantly larger amount of total IgG in serum, as well as an increase of CD19+ cells in the inguinal lymph nodes, were observed in the peptide-immunized mice compared to the control. The ratios of IFN-gamma-secreting lymphocytes in CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells in the peptide-immunized mice were higher than those in the control mice. There were also a larger number of IFN-gamma-secreting T-cells in the spleens of peptide-immunized mice. The peptide vaccines in this study successfully elicited antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. To further validate the safety and efficacy of this vaccine, animal studies using a primate model, as well as clinical trials in humans, are required.	Mechanism;Treatment
34227196	Clinical Frailty Score vs Hospital Frailty Risk Score for predicting mortality and other adverse outcome in hospitalised patients with COVID-19: Spanish case series. OBJECTIVES: Frailty can be used as a predictor of adverse outcomes in people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of the study was to analyse the prognostic value of two different frailty scores in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult (>/=18 years) inpatients with COVID-19 and took place from 3 March to 2 May 2020. Patients were categorised by Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were tocilizumab treatment, length of hospital stay, admission in intensive care unit (ICU) and need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Results were analysed by multivariable logistic regression and expressed as odds ratios (ORs), adjusting for age, sex, kidney function and comorbidity. RESULTS: Of the 290 included patients, 54 were frail according to the CFS (>/=5 points; prevalence 18.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.4-23.7) vs 65 by HFRS (>/=5 points; prevalence: 22.4%, 95% CI 17.8-27.7). Prevalence of frailty increased with age according to both measures: 50-64 years, CFS 1.9% vs HFRS 12.3%; 65-79 years, CFS 31.5% vs HFRS 40.0%; and >/=80 years, CFS 66.7% vs HFRS 40.0% (P < .001). CFS-defined frailty was independently associated with risk of death (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.49-9.04) and less treatment with tocilizumab (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08-0.93). HFRS-defined frailty was independently associated with length of hospital stay over 10 days (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.53-5.44), ICU admission (OR 4.18, 95% CI 1.84-9.52) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 5.93, 95% CI 2.33-15.10). CONCLUSION: In the spring 2020 wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, CFS-defined frailty was an independent predictor for death, while frailty as measured by the HFRS was associated with length of hospital stay over 10 days, ICU admission and use of invasive mechanical ventilation.

34353108	Three phases of COVID-19: theoretical thinking on epidemic prevention and control. The response to the COVID-19 outbreak was evaluated by analyzing the literature published after the outbreak. By reviewing and summarizing the different stages, nodes and measures during the occurrence and development of COVID-19, other countries can draw on their experience and reference for the fight against COVID-19 in China. In December 2019, the COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and then the whole world continued to pay close attention to the development of the COVID-19 in China. Until now, the outbreak and development of the COVID-19 has lasted for more than a year. Looking back on the process of the COVID-19, several key stages and events have had a profound impact on the development of the COVID-19. We divided the evolution of the outbreak since its origin into different phases. The policy changes of the Chinese government in different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated, and the transformation nodes of the policies and differences in each stage were determined. We divided the evolution of the outbreak into three stages of the outbreak are initial outbreak stage, the carrying of the virus (people or goods) stage, and the non-direct contact transmission (goods transmission) stage. This paper reviews the three stages of the evolution of responses by the Chinese government to COVID-19 using a phase analysis method to examine different policy starting points, changes to policy, and reasons for policy change. The study provides a resource for COVID-19 policy review and includes image of the three-phase shift in policy as the epidemic progressed. By summarizing and describing the policy changes in the three phases of the response to COVID-19 in China, this paper provides a resource for others in formulating their response to the pandemic. The commentary is also designed to provoke scholarly dialog among the readers of the journal.	Prevention;Transmission
34207490	A Comprehensive Molecular Epidemiological Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Cyprus from April 2020 to January 2021: Evidence of a Highly Polyphyletic and Evolving Epidemic. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in an extraordinary global public health crisis. In early 2020, Cyprus, among other European countries, was affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and adopted lockdown measures in March 2020 to limit the initial outbreak on the island. In this study, we performed a comprehensive retrospective molecular epidemiological analysis (genetic, phylogenetic, phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses) of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Cyprus from April 2020 to January 2021, covering the first ten months of the SARS-CoV-2 infection epidemic on the island. The primary aim of this study was to assess the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. Whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from 596 clinical samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) obtained from community-based diagnostic testing centers and hospitalized patients. The phylogenetic analyses revealed a total of 34 different lineages in Cyprus, with B.1.258, B.1.1.29, B.1.177, B.1.2, B.1 and B.1.1.7 (designated a Variant of Concern 202012/01, VOC) being the most prevalent lineages on the island during the study period. Phylodynamic analysis showed a highly dynamic epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with three consecutive surges characterized by specific lineages (B.1.1.29 from April to June 2020; B.1.258 from September 2020 to January 2021; and B.1.1.7 from December 2020 to January 2021). Genetic analysis of whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of the aforementioned lineages revealed the presence of mutations within the S protein (L18F, DeltaH69/V70, S898F, DeltaY144, S162G, A222V, N439K, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, S982A and D1118H) that confer higher transmissibility and/or antibody escape (immune evasion) upon the virus. Phylogeographic analysis indicated that the majority of imports and exports were to and from the United Kingdom (UK), although many other regions/countries were identified (southeastern Asia, southern Europe, eastern Europe, Germany, Italy, Brazil, Chile, the USA, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Finland, Switzerland and Pakistan). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 infection epidemic in Cyprus is being maintained by a continuous influx of lineages from many countries, resulting in the establishment of an ever-evolving and polyphyletic virus on the island.

34350813	Higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity in hospital-based healthcare workers compared to elderly care staff in a Swedish low-prevalence region: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: Previous seroprevalence studies have demonstrated higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence in healthcare workers (HCWs) than in the background population during the first phase of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. These studies, however, focussed mainly on hospital employees. AIM: To perform a cross-sectional study comparing the seroprevalence of hospital-based HCWs with those employed in elderly care (home care and nursing homes). METHODS: Employees (n = 4955) in the county of Varmland, Sweden, were recruited between weeks 27 and 42 and tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Serological results were combined with self-reported questionnaire data. FINDINGS: IgG seroprevalence was 5.7% in the total group of HCWs, and was higher among those employed in hospital-based healthcare than among those working in elderly care (8.4% vs. 3.7%, p < .001). Being employed as an assistant nurse, working in a COVID-19 unit, and being exposed via co-workers or private acquaintances were all associated with IgG seropositivity. CONCLUSION: The difference in seroprevalence between HCWs in the two settings suggests that not only the profession but also factors in the workplace environment may be of importance. As all studied exposures were associated with IgG seropositivity, and asymptomatic infection was detected in 7.5% of participants, preventing outbreaks among HCWs is challenging. Adequate use of personal protective equipment when working with patients regardless of COVID-19 status, source control in situations with co-workers in which distancing is not possible, and routines enabling symptomatic staff to isolate pending PCR results are required to prevent healthcare-associated outbreaks of COVID-19.

34224674	Clinical characteristics and outcomes of invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 in Argentina (SATICOVID): a prospective, multicentre cohort study. BACKGROUND: Although COVID-19 has greatly affected many low-income and middle-income countries, detailed information about patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) is still scarce. Our aim was to examine ventilation characteristics and outcomes in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 in Argentina, an upper middle-income country. METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre cohort study (SATICOVID), we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 who were on invasive mechanical ventilation and admitted to one of 63 ICUs in Argentina. Patient demographics and clinical, laboratory, and general management variables were collected on day 1 (ICU admission); physiological respiratory and ventilation variables were collected on days 1, 3, and 7. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. All patients were followed until death in hospital or hospital discharge, whichever occurred first. Secondary outcomes were ICU mortality, identification of independent predictors of mortality, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and patterns of change in physiological respiratory and mechanical ventilation variables. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04611269, and is complete. FINDINGS: Between March 20, 2020, and Oct 31, 2020, we enrolled 1909 invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19, with a median age of 62 years [IQR 52-70]. 1294 (67.8%) were men, hypertension and obesity were the main comorbidities, and 939 (49.2%) patients required vasopressors. Lung-protective ventilation was widely used and median duration of ventilation was 13 days (IQR 7-22). Median tidal volume was 6.1 mL/kg predicted bodyweight (IQR 6.0-7.0) on day 1, and the value increased significantly up to day 7; positive end-expiratory pressure was 10 cm H2O (8-12) on day 1, with a slight but significant decrease to day 7. Ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) was 160 (IQR 111-218), respiratory system compliance 36 mL/cm H2O (29-44), driving pressure 12 cm H2O (10-14), and FiO2 0.60 (0.45-0.80) on day 1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome developed in 1672 (87.6%) of patients; 1176 (61.6%) received prone positioning. In-hospital mortality was 57.7% (1101/1909 patients) and ICU mortality was 57.0% (1088/1909 patients); 462 (43.8%) patients died of refractory hypoxaemia, frequently overlapping with septic shock (n=174). Cox regression identified age (hazard ratio 1.02 [95% CI 1.01-1.03]), Charlson score (1.16 [1.11-1.23]), endotracheal intubation outside of the ICU (ie, before ICU admission; 1.37 [1.10-1.71]), vasopressor use on day 1 (1.29 [1.07-1.55]), D-dimer concentration (1.02 [1.01-1.03]), PaO2/FiO2 on day 1 (0.998 [0.997-0.999]), arterial pH on day 1 (1.01 [1.00-1.01]), driving pressure on day 1 (1.05 [1.03-1.08]), acute kidney injury (1.66 [1.36-2.03]), and month of admission (1.10 [1.03-1.18]) as independent predictors of mortality. INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19 who required invasive mechanical ventilation, lung-protective ventilation was widely used but mortality was high. Predictors of mortality in our study broadly agreed with those identified in studies of invasively ventilated patients in high-income countries. The sustained burden of COVID-19 on scarce health-care personnel might have contributed to high mortality over the course of our study in Argentina. These data might help to identify points for improvement in the management of patients in middle-income countries and elsewhere. FUNDING: None.

34220054	Consensus Statement on Neurorehabilitation during COVID-19 Times: Expert Group on Behalf of the Indian Federation of Neurorehabilitation (IFNR). The COVID19 pandemic in India is causing significant morbidity and disruptions of healthcare delivery. The rapidly escalating contagion is straining our public health system, which is already under pressure due to a shortage of infrastructure and inadequate workforce. Neuro rehabilitation services that are still in its infancy in our country have been significantly interrupted in the last six months. An expert group from Indian Federation of Neurorehabilitation (IFNR) have formulated the guidelines and consensus recommendations for Neurologists, Physiatrists, and Therapists managing neurological disabilities during COVID 19. The aim of this consensus paper is to sensitize the clinicians and therapists about maintaining the continuum of care and rehabilitation needs of Covid patients as well as non Covid patients with neurological disorders during the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic.

34377880	Analyzing COVID-19 Using Multisource Data: An Integrated Approach of Visualization, Spatial Regression, and Machine Learning. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths worldwide continues to increase rapidly, the prevention and control of COVID-19 remains urgent. This article aims to analyze COVID-19 from a geographical perspective, and this information can provide useful insights for rapid visualization of spatial-temporal epidemic information and identification of the factors important to the spread of COVID-19. A new type of vitalization method, called the point grid map, is integrated with calendar-based visualization to show the spatial-temporal variations in COVID-19. The combination of mixed geographically weighted regression (mixed GWR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is used to identify the potential factors and the corresponding importance. The visualization results clearly reflect the spatial-temporal patterns of COVID-19. The quantified results reveal that the impact of population outflow from Wuhan is the most important factor and indicate statistically significant spatial heterogeneity. Our results provide insights into how multisource big geodata can be employed within the framework of integrating visualization and analytical methods to characterize COVID-19 trends. In addition, this work can help understand the influential factors for controlling and preventing epidemics, which is important for policy design and effective decision-making for controlling COVID-19. The results reveal that one of the most effective ways to control COVID-19 include controlling the source of infection, cutting off the transmission route, and protecting vulnerable groups.

34227771	Alveolar Air Leak Syndrome a Potential Complication of COVID- 19-ARDS - Single Center Retrospective Analysis. Background: Alveolar air leak comprising of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema in the ongoing COVID 19 pneumonia have been increasingly reported in literature. These air leaks were also recognized in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and H1N1 viral pandemics. Here we review the incidence and outcomes of alveolar air leaks over 400 patients admitted to our tertiary care institution for moderate-severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We performed a retrospective audit of moderate to severe COVID-19 cases admitted to our hospital. Patients who were recognized as either a spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium and subcutaneous emphysema were identified. Their clinical features and characteristics were thoroughly documented and clinical outcomes were gathered. Each case has been presented as a brief synopsis. Results: During the audit period, we reviewed over 670 patients, out of these 419 patients required intensive care for moderate to severe disease. 10 patients developed Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium and/ or subcutaneous emphysema - referred to as Alveolar Air leak syndrome; The incidence of alveolar air leak was found to be 2.39%. 6 patients did not survive the resultant complication. Conclusion: Spontaneous alveolar air leaks are a rare but definite complication of COVID-19 viral pneumonia and may occur in the absence of mechanical ventilation. ICU Clinicians must be alert about the diagnosis and treatment of this complication.	Diagnosis;Treatment

We describe a Sanger sequencing protocol for SARS-CoV-2 S-gene the Spike (S)-glycoprotein product of which, composed of receptor-binding (S1) and membrane fusion (S2) segments, is the target of vaccines used to combat COVID-19. The protocol can be used in laboratories with basic Sanger sequencing capabilities and allows rapid ""at source"" screening for SARS-CoV-2 variants, notably those of concern. The protocol has been applied for surveillance, with clinical specimens collected in either nucleic acid preservation lysis-mix or virus transport medium, and research involving cultured viruses, and can yield data of public health importance in a timely manner."

34226277	A serum proteome signature to predict mortality in severe COVID-19 patients. Here, we recorded serum proteome profiles of 33 severe COVID-19 patients admitted to respiratory and intensive care units because of respiratory failure. We received, for most patients, blood samples just after admission and at two more later time points. With the aim to predict treatment outcome, we focused on serum proteins different in abundance between the group of survivors and non-survivors. We observed that a small panel of about a dozen proteins were significantly different in abundance between these two groups. The four structurally and functionally related type-3 cystatins AHSG, FETUB, histidine-rich glycoprotein, and KNG1 were all more abundant in the survivors. The family of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitors, ITIH1, ITIH2, ITIH3, and ITIH4, were all found to be differentially abundant in between survivors and non-survivors, whereby ITIH1 and ITIH2 were more abundant in the survivor group and ITIH3 and ITIH4 more abundant in the non-survivors. ITIH1/ITIH2 and ITIH3/ITIH4 also showed opposite trends in protein abundance during disease progression. We defined an optimal panel of nine proteins for mortality risk assessment. The prediction power of this mortality risk panel was evaluated against two recent COVID-19 serum proteomics studies on independent cohorts measured in other laboratories in different countries and observed to perform very well in predicting mortality also in these cohorts. This panel may not be unique for COVID-19 as some of the proteins in the panel have previously been annotated as mortality markers in aging and in other diseases caused by different pathogens, including bacteria.

34202217	Active Aging Governance and Challenges at the Local Level. International and national guidelines have been promoting active aging while creating the necessary means for decision-makers and other relevant actors to work together (governance mechanisms) to implement local and active aging policies. This is especially important in the present COVID-19 pandemic context, posing greater challenges on older people who tend to be self-isolated. How are local actors conceptualizing active aging? What are their priorities related to a healthy life for older people? Which governance mechanisms are used to implement such policies? These are some of the questions addressed in this paper, targeting Portugal, a southern European country. A mixed-methods sequential explanatory design combining a survey conducted at a national level and interviews with key actors in the NUTS III Aveiro Region was employed to identify and understand the underpinning governance mechanisms. Findings confirm the 'passive organization type' in which European politico-territorial studies tend to place Portugal, as there are gaps in the way policies are formulated, implemented and evaluated, as well as a lack of coordination. Results of this study have important impacts on the way local governments and other stakeholders will prepare themselves in the post-pandemic period to design and implement policies addressing active aging.

34209556	Antiviral Activity of Vitis vinifera Leaf Extract against SARS-CoV-2 and HSV-1. Vitis vinifera represents an important and renowned source of compounds with significant biological activity. Wines and winery bioproducts, such as grape pomace, skins, and seeds, are rich in bioactive compounds against a wide range of human pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. However, little is known about the biological properties of vine leaves. The aim of this study was the evaluation of phenolic composition and antiviral activity of Vitis vinifera leaf extract against two human viruses: the Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and the pandemic and currently widespread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). About 40 phenolic compounds were identified in the extract by HPLC-MS/MS analysis: most of them were quercetin derivatives, others included derivatives of luteolin, kaempferol, apigenin, isorhamnetin, myricetin, chrysoeriol, biochanin, isookanin, and scutellarein. Leaf extract was able to inhibit both HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 replication in the early stages of infection by directly blocking the proteins enriched on the viral surface, at a very low concentration of 10 mug/mL. These results are very promising and highlight how natural extracts could be used in the design of antiviral drugs and the development of future vaccines.	Mechanism;Treatment
34289817	Beliefs and barriers associated with COVID-19 vaccination among the general population in Saudi Arabia. BACKGROUND: Developing a vaccine against COVID-19 is considered a key strategy to end the pandemic. However, public acceptance is reliant on beliefs and perception toward the vaccine. Therefore, the study aimed to assess the beliefs and barriers associated with COVID-19 vaccination among the Saudi population. METHODS: An online self-administered questionnaire was distributed across the main regions of Saudi Arabia on May 2020. The questionnaire addressed the socio-demographic variables, beliefs toward COVID-19 vaccination, and potential barriers that may prevent participants from being vaccinated. The association between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and sociodemographic variables were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predicting variables of vaccine acceptance. RESULTS: Out of 3101 participants, 44.7% were accepting of COVID-19 vaccination if available, whereas 55.3% admitted hesitancy. Younger, male, who received seasonal influenza vaccine were more likely to accept taking the vaccine. The study found that concerns about side effects were the key barrier for vaccine acceptance. Furthermore, the majority of refusers may accept the vaccine if additional studies confirmed safety and effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Results can be utilized in planning vaccination campaigns while waiting for vaccine development.	Treatment
34293118	Incidence and course of COVID-19 hospitalizations among patients with familial Mediterranean fever. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence of hospitalization for COVID-19 in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), as compared with the general population, and to compare the disease course between FMF inpatients, and age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidity-matched non-FMF COVID-19 inpatients. METHODS: We used electronic medical records (EMR) to obtain data about the total number of the insured population and the number of FMF patients in the two largest health management organizations (HMOs) in Jerusalem, Clalit and Meuhedet. The total number of COVID-19 inpatients at the Hadassah Medical Center, including those with FMF, for the period between the 1 February 2020, and the 10 March 2021 was retrieved from the EMR of Hadassah. COVID-19 course was compared between the FMF inpatient group and age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidity-matched non-FMF COVID-19 inpatients. Each FMF inpatient was matched with 2 non-FMF controls. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant difference in the odds of hospitalization for COVID-19 between FMF patients and the non-FMF population (0.46% vs 0.41%; p= 0.73). Furthermore, we found similar disease severity and therapeutic approach in FMF COVID-19 inpatients and matched non-FMF COVID-19 inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Neither FMF, nor baseline colchicine therapy appear to affect the incidence of hospitalization for COVID-19 or the disease course, in terms of severity and therapeutic approach.

34290180	Knowledge attitude and practice of safety measures for corona virus disease - 19 (COVID-19) among general population. Objective: To evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of general population for Corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19). Methods: A total of 950 participants submitted an online self-administered questionnaire, which was developed through literature search and validated. The online survey link was distributed through various social media platforms (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest, and Tumblr). And 861 forms were included in the study after checking for completion of relevant response from participants, whereas 89 forms were excluded. The data were analyzed through Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Descriptive statistics were performed for percentage and frequency determination of quantitative and qualitative variables. Spearman's correlation and Chi square test were performed to control confounders and association of knowledge, attitude, and practices with gender and education level. The P value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: More than two third of the population was aware of COVID-19 and three fourth had had bachelor's degrees, whereas 18% had master level education. 85% have not attended any courses, awareness campaigns, and lectures to inculcate recent and updated knowledge. 83% believed that COVID-19 is a serious threat to the community; hence, prevention strategies should be adopted. There was no significant relationship (p = 0.23) between knowledge, attitude, and practice levels with gender, whereas a significant relationship (p = 0.01) was noted with education of participant. Similarly, a significant relationship (p = 0.00) was seen between knowledge and practices of participants toward COVID-19. Conclusion: The studied population displayed adequate knowledge, attitude, and practice to combat COVID-19. However, we also find a knowledge gap between information source and perception of COVID-19 among our study participants. Therefore, there is a critical need for effective education and widespread public campaigns aiming to enhance relevant and contemporary information related to prevention and management of COVID-19.

34226764	Unmasking the demand for masks: Analytics of mandating coronavirus masks. This paper analytically examines the demand for surgical masks following the recent health precautions due to coronavirus. Using a simple linear demand curve and alternatively examining the impacts of requirements that mandate (a) the wearing of masks by frontline workers; (b) suggested but not required masking by the whole public; and (c) compulsory masking by the whole public. The impacts of the different scenarios on the price elasticity of demand are determined along with the slope (or the rate of change) of elasticity. Some of these results differ when a non-linear demand curve is considered instead. The equilibrium mask prices increase when masks are universally mandated, whereas the consumer surplus is higher when masks are recommended but not mandated. However, the ranking of consumer surplus is shown to be sensitive to the supply elasticity of masks. These considerations enable a structured means to view the demand implications of masking requirements and provide some food for policy thought.	Prevention

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Patients with hematologic malignancies have been shown to have higher risk of mortality due to COVID-19 than reported in the general adult population. Reports on acute lymphoblastic leukemia and COVID in children are scarce. We present a case of an 11-year-old male patient undergoing treatment for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with an atypical course of COVID-19. The patient received a positive result of the syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction test performed due to epidemiologic reasons. The chemotherapy was continued since the patient had no clinical signs of COVID-19. The disease started with intensive gastrointestinal bleeding, followed by severe respiratory tract infection over 2 weeks later.	Case Report
34214142	ACE2-lentiviral transduction enables mouse SARS-CoV-2 infection and mapping of receptor interactions. SARS-CoV-2 uses the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor for cell attachment and entry, with mouse ACE2 (mACE2) unable to support infection. Herein we describe an ACE2-lentivirus system and illustrate its utility for in vitro and in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection models. Transduction of non-permissive cell lines with hACE2 imparted replication competence, and transduction with mACE2 containing N30D, N31K, F83Y and H353K substitutions, to match hACE2, rescued SARS-CoV-2 replication. Intrapulmonary hACE2-lentivirus transduction of C57BL/6J mice permitted significant virus replication in lung epithelium. RNA-Seq and histological analyses illustrated that this model involved an acute inflammatory disease followed by resolution and tissue repair, with a transcriptomic profile similar to that seen in COVID-19 patients. hACE2-lentivirus transduction of IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- mouse lungs was used to illustrate that loss of type I or III interferon responses have no significant effect on virus replication. However, their importance in driving inflammatory responses was illustrated by RNA-Seq analyses. We also demonstrate the utility of the hACE2-lentivirus transduction system for vaccine evaluation in C57BL/6J mice. The ACE2-lentivirus system thus has broad application in SARS-CoV-2 research, providing a tool for both mutagenesis studies and mouse model development.	Mechanism;Treatment
34343725	Circulating miRNAs: Potential diagnostic role for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nowadays, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a major global health problem. Intensive efforts are being employed to better understand this pathology and develop strategies enabling its early diagnosis and efficient treatment. In this study, we compared the signature of circulating miRNAs in plasma of COVID-19 patients versus healthy donors. MiRCURY LNA miRNA miRNome qPCR Panels were performed for miRNA signature characterization. Individual quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out to validate miRNome qPCR results. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the most significantly deregulated miRNA(s) as potential diagnostic biomarker(s). Eight miRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed with miR-17-5p and miR-142-5p being down-regulated whilst miR-15a-5p, miR-19a-3p, miR-19b-3p, miR-23a-3p, miR-92a-3p and miR-320a being up-regulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. ROC curve analyses revealed an AUC (Areas Under the ROC Curve) of 0.815 (P=0.031), 0.875 (P=0.012), and 0.850 (P=0.025) for miR-19a-3p, miR-19b-3p, and miR-92a-3p, respectively. Combined ROC analyses using these 3 miRNAs showed a greater AUC of 0.917 (P=0.0001) indicating a robust diagnostic value of these 3 miRNAs. These results suggest that plasma miR-19a-3p, miR-19b-3p, and miR-92a-3p expression levels could serve as potential diagnostic biomarker and/or a putative therapeutic target during SARS-CoV-2-infection.

34200934	SARS-CoV-2: An Overview of Virus Genetics, Transmission, and Immunopathogenesis. The human population is currently facing the third and possibly the worst pandemic caused by human coronaviruses (CoVs). The virus was first reported in Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019 and spread within a short time to almost all countries of the world. Genome analysis of the early virus isolates has revealed high similarity with SARS-CoV and hence the new virus was officially named SARS-CoV-2. Since CoVs have the largest genome among all RNA viruses, they can adapt to many point mutation and recombination events; particularly in the spike gene, which enable these viruses to rapidly change and evolve in nature. CoVs are known to cross the species boundaries by using different cellular receptors. Both animal reservoir and intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 are still unresolved and necessitate further investigation. In the current review, different aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and pathogenicity are discussed, including virus genetics and evolution, spike protein and its role in evolution and adaptation to novel hosts, and virus transmission and persistence in nature. In addition, the immune response developed during SARS-CoV-2 infection is demonstrated with special reference to the interplay between immune cells and their role in disease progression. We believe that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will not be the last and spillover of CoVs from bats will continue. Therefore, establishing intervention approaches to reduce the likelihood of future CoVs spillover from natural reservoirs is a priority.	Mechanism;Transmission
34228685	Acute Care Reimagined: Home Hospital Care Can Support the Triple Aim and Reduce Health Disparities. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Home hospital care (HHC) is a new and exciting concept that holds the promise of achieving all three components of the Triple Aim and reducing health disparities. As an innovative care delivery model, HHC substitutes traditional inpatient hospital care with hospital care at home for older patients with certain conditions. Studies have shown evidence of reduced cost of care, improved patient satisfaction, and enhanced quality and safety of care for patients treated through this model. The steady growth in Medicare Advantage enrollment and the expansion in 2020 of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospitals Without Walls program to include acute hospital care at home creates an opportunity for hospitals to implement such programs and be financially rewarded for reducing costs. Capacity constraints exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that now is the ideal time for healthcare leaders to test and advance the concept of HHC in their communities.	Prevention
34289384	Prevention and therapy of SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.351 variant in mice. Improving clinical care for individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants is a global health priority. Small-molecule antivirals like remdesivir (RDV) and biologics such as human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is not known whether combination RDV/mAb will improve outcomes over single-agent therapies or whether antibody therapies will remain efficacious against variants. Here, we show that a combination of two mAbs in clinical trials, C144 and C135, have potent antiviral effects against even when initiated 48 h after infection and have therapeutic efficacy in vivo against the B.1.351 variant of concern (VOC). Combining RDV and antibodies provided a modest improvement in outcomes compared with single agents. These data support the continued use of RDV to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections and the continued clinical development of the C144 and C135 antibody combination to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants.

34131867	Living Donor Liver Transplantation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: an Evolving Challenge. BACKGROUND: Maintaining standards of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) can be a challenge during the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Center-specific protocols have been developed and transplant societies propose limiting elective LDLT. We have looked at outcomes of LDLT during the pandemic in an exclusively LDLT center. METHODS: Patients were grouped into pre-COVID (January 2019-February 2020) (n = 162) and COVID (March 2020-January 2021) (n = 53) cohorts. We looked at patient characteristics, 30-day morbidity, and mortality. Outcomes were also assessed in donors and recipients who underwent surgery after recovery from COVID-19. RESULTS: The average number of transplants reduced from 11.5/month to 4.8/month. Fewer patients with MELD > 20 underwent LDLT in the COVID cohort (41.3% versus 24.5%, P = 0.03). Out of nine patients with a positive pretransplant COVID-19 PCR, there were 2 (22.3%) deaths on the waiting list. Seven patients underwent LT after recovery from COVID-19 with one 30-day mortality due to biliary sepsis. Three donors with positive COVID-19 PCR underwent uneventful donation after testing negative for COVID-19. No significant difference in 30-day survival was observed in the pre-COVID and COVID cohorts (93.2% versus 90.6%) (P = 0.3). Out of two recipients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia within 30 days after LT, there was one mortality. The 1-year survival for the entire cohort with a MELD cutoff of 20 was 90% and 84% (P = 0.2). CONCLUSION: Despite comparable outcomes, fewer sick patients might undergo LDLT during the pandemic. Individuals recovered from COVID-19 might be safely considered for donation or transplantation.

34353740	COVID-19 patients with obesity at risk for worse outcomes despite younger age and fewer inflammatory derangements. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral pulmonary infection that can progress to cytokine storm syndrome because of widespread dysregulated inflammatory response. Many patients at risk for severe COVID-19 manifestation have been identified as those with preexisting conditions of pulmonary origin, as well as conditions that impair appropriate immune response, such as obesity. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe the manifestation, clinical course, and inflammatory biomarker milieu of COVID-19 in patients with obesity. SETTING: University Hospital Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 600 patients who were positive for COVID-19 were stratified by World Health Organization (WHO) obesity class and their presenting symptoms, disease biomarkers, demographics, and outcomes (intubation rate, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, length of stay [LOS], and mortality) were investigated. RESULTS: Age was inversely related to obesity class; patients of obesity class III presented 12.9 years younger than patients of normal weight (P < .0001). Initial ferritin lab values were negatively correlated with increasing obesity class (P = .0192). Normal or near-normal lymphocyte profile was noted in patients with obesity compared with patients without obesity (P = .0017). Patients with obesity had an increased rate of ICU admission (P = .0215) and increased length of stay (P = .0004), but no differences in intubation rate (P = .3705) or mortality (P = .2486). CONCLUSION: Patients with obesity were more likely to present to the hospital at a younger age, with reduced levels of COVID-19 related biomarker disturbances, and increased LOS and ICU admission rates, although were not at increased risk for mortality.

34337524	Mobile PSA: A Novel Telehealth Tool for Prostate Cancer Follow-Up. The prevalence of prostate cancer (PCa) is increasing. As the prognosis of PCa continues to improve, the increasing follow-up requirements after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy puts significant pressure on health care systems. Follow-up is typically conducted by treating urologists, specialized nurses, or general practitioners. Despite the increase in patient numbers, resources are not likely to increase in proportion. Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a paradigm shift in our thinking towards telehealth solutions, primarily to avoid or limit physical contact and to spare resources. Here we report our novel telehealth solution for PCa follow-up, called Mobile PSA. Currently, more than 4500 PCa patients have been using Mobile PSA follow-up in our center. Mobile PSA can increase follow-up accuracy, as all biochemical relapses will be detected in a timely manner, can significantly reduce delays in reporting prostate-specific antigen results to patients, and can significantly reduce costs. Patient summary: We assessed a new telehealth information system for prostate cancer follow-up that does not use an app. More than 4500 prostate cancer patients in our center have used this system, called Mobile PSA, for follow-up. The system significantly reduces delays in reporting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test results to patients, increases the accuracy of detecting recurrence of elevated PSA, and reduces costs.

34207756	A Multidisciplinary Approach to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). Since December 2019, humanity has faced an important global threat. Many studies have been published on the origin, structure, and mechanism of action of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the treatment of its disease. The priority of scientists all over the world has been to direct their time to research this subject. In this review, we highlight chemical studies and therapeutic approaches to overcome COVID-19 with seven different sections. These sections are the structure and mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, immunotherapy and vaccine, computer-aided drug design, repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19, synthesis of new molecular structures against COVID-19, food safety/security and functional food components, and potential natural products against COVID-19. In this work, we aimed to screen all the newly synthesized compounds, repurposing chemicals covering antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiparasitic, anticancer, antipsychotic, and antihistamine compounds against COVID-19. We also highlight computer-aided approaches to develop an anti-COVID-19 molecule. We explain that some phytochemicals and dietary supplements have been identified as antiviral bioproducts, which have almost been successfully tested against COVID-19. In addition, we present immunotherapy types, targets, immunotherapy and inflammation/mutations of the virus, immune response, and vaccine issues.	Mechanism;Treatment
34290494	Retrospective Analysis of the Effects of Non-Compliance with Denosumab on Changes in Bone Mineral Density During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Purpose: Although denosumab is a safe and effective treatment for osteoporosis in various clinical trials, few studies have investigated its efficacy in specific clinical situations. The effect of non-compliance with the standard six-month dosing regimen for denosumab on bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed in a retrospective study of patients prescribed denosumab during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients and Methods: Between February 2019 and September 2020, 638 patient records were reviewed, with 236 patients meeting the eligibility criteria. Patients were divided into three groups: those who received denosumab injections between five and seven months after their initial subcutaneous injection, those who received denosumab injections between seven and nine months after their initial subcutaneous injection, and those who received denosumab injections more than nine months after their initial subcutaneous injection. A multivariate regression study was conducted to compare the BMD shift (at least one year apart) before and after two denosumab injections between the three pre-specified groups in both the lumbar spine (LS) and the femoral neck (FN). Results: The difference between LS BMD indicates that there is a statistical difference between subjects who received denosumab injections between 5 and 7 months (near-standard dosing interval) and more than 9 months (P=0.03), but not in FN BMD, and no clinically significant association was identified. Conclusion: The results of this study show that in special clinical situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians may have some flexibility to prescribe denosumab, but the interval between injections should not exceed 9 months.

34202374	Flavonoids as Promising Antiviral Agents against SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Mechanistic Review. A newly diagnosed coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19) has affected all human activities since its discovery. Flavonoids commonly found in the human diet have attracted a lot of attention due to their remarkable biological activities. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the benefits of flavonoids in COVID-19 disease. Previously-reported effects of flavonoids on five RNA viruses with similar clinical manifestations and/or pharmacological treatments, including influenza, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola, were considered. Flavonoids act via direct antiviral properties, where they inhibit different stages of the virus infective cycle and indirect effects when they modulate host responses to viral infection and subsequent complications. Flavonoids have shown antiviral activity via inhibition of viral protease, RNA polymerase, and mRNA, virus replication, and infectivity. The compounds were also effective for the regulation of interferons, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and sub-cellular inflammatory pathways such as nuclear factor-kappaB and Jun N-terminal kinases. Baicalin, quercetin and its derivatives, hesperidin, and catechins are the most studied flavonoids in this regard. In conclusion, dietary flavonoids are promising treatment options against COVID-19 infection; however, future investigations are recommended to assess the antiviral properties of these compounds on this disease.

34280992	"Physical Activity among Adults Residing in 11 Countries during the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown. During the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, physical activity (PA) behaviors were altered worldwide due to public health measures such as ""lockdown."" This study described PA among adults residing in 11 countries during COVID-19 lockdown and examined factors associated with PA engagement. We conducted a cross-sectional anonymous survey among adults (>/=18 years old) in 11 countries (Brazil, Bulgaria, China, India, Ireland, Malaysia, North Macedonia, Singapore, Spain, Turkey, United States). Of 11,775 participants, 63.7% were female and 52.8% were 18-34 years old. More than 40% of participants were insufficiently active (43.9%) and reported a decrease in their PA during lockdown (44.8%). Statistically significant differences were observed in (1) proportions of participants being insufficiently active, (2) level of PA, and (3) decrease in PA across the 11 countries. More stringent governmental policy responses were associated with greater likelihood of being insufficiently active during lockdown (adjusted odds ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval = 1.03, 1.45). Higher depression or anxiety scores were associated with greater likelihood of decreased level of PA during lockdown.We found substantial reductions in PA levels during COVID-19 lockdown across countries. Country-specific PA promotion interventions are needed during this and similar global emergencies."	Prevention
34207020	Use of Antimicrobials among Suspected COVID-19 Patients at Selected Hospitals, Bangladesh: Findings from the First Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic. Antimicrobials are empirically used in COVID-19 patients resulting in increased antimicrobial resistance. Our objective was to assess antimicrobial use among suspected COVID-19 in-patients. From March to August 2020, we collected data from in-patients of 12 tertiary-level hospitals across Bangladesh. We identified suspected COVID-19 patients; collected information on antimicrobial received within 24 h before and on hospitalization; tested nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 using rRT-PCR. We used descriptive statistics and a regression model for data analysis. Among 1188 suspected COVID-19 patients, 69% were male, 40% had comorbidities, and 53% required oxygen. Antibiotics were used in 92% of patients, 47% within 24 h before, and 89% on admission. Patients also received antiviral (1%) and antiparasitic drugs (3%). Third-generation cephalosporin use was the highest (708; 60%), followed by macrolide (481; 40%), and the majority (853; 78%) who took antibiotics were SARS-CoV-2 negative. On admission, 77% mild and 94% moderately ill patients received antibiotics. Antibiotic use on admission was higher among severely ill patients (AOR = 11.7; 95% CI: 4.5-30.1) and those who received antibiotics within 24 h before hospital admission (AOR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.0-2.5). Antimicrobial use was highly prevalent among suspected COVID-19 in-patients in Bangladesh. Initiating treatment with third-generation cephalosporin among mild to moderately ill patients was common. Promoting antimicrobial stewardship with monitoring is essential to prevent blanket antibiotic use, thereby mitigating antimicrobial resistance.	Treatment
34284784	Epicardial adipose tissue and severe Coronavirus Disease 19. BACKGROUND: Both visceral adipose tissue and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) have pro-inflammatory properties. The former is associated with Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) severity. We aimed to investigate whether an association also exists for EAT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively measured EAT volume using computed tomography (CT) scans (semi-automatic software) of inpatients with COVID-19 and analyzed the correlation between EAT volume and anthropometric characteristics and comorbidities. We then analyzed the clinicobiological and radiological parameters associated with severe COVID-19 (O2 [Formula: see text] 6 l/min), intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death, and 25% or more CT lung involvement, which are three key indicators of COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: We included 100 consecutive patients; 63% were men, mean age was 61.8 +/- 16.2 years, 47% were obese, 54% had hypertension, 42% diabetes, and 17.2% a cardiovascular event history. Severe COVID-19 (n = 35, 35%) was associated with EAT volume (132 +/- 62 vs 104 +/- 40 cm(3), p = 0.02), age, ferritinemia, and 25% or more CT lung involvement. ICU admission or death (n = 14, 14%) was associated with EAT volume (153 +/- 67 vs 108 +/- 45 cm(3), p = 0.015), hypertension and 25% or more CT lung involvement. The association between EAT volume and severe COVID-19 remained after adjustment for sex, BMI, ferritinemia and lung involvement, but not after adjustment for age. Instead, the association between EAT volume and ICU admission or death remained after adjustment for all five of these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that measuring EAT volume on chest CT scans at hospital admission in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 might help to assess the risk of disease aggravation.

34211651	A 22-year-old COVID-19 positive male with no prior medical history presented to the emergency department with pulmonary infarction. Rapidly growing evidence has now shown a high incidence of venous thrombosis in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome secondary to novel coronavirus 2, a disease now named COVID-19. Accumulating case reports and series have also shown a higher prevalence of arterial thrombosis in these patients as well. Although the pathophysiology remains unknown but likely multifactorial - including endotheliitis from direct viral damage and an underlying hyper-inflammatory state, arterial and venous thrombosis occurrence does not appear to be linked with underlying classic risk factors for venous thromboembolism and may present in healthy patients without significant comorbidities. We present a case of a 22-year-old healthy patient with COVID-19 who developed a pulmonary embolism with a pulmonary infarction, a complication that results from arterial and venous thrombosis of the pulmonary vascular supply resulting in tissue necrosis.

34207916	Vaccination in PADs. Primary antibody deficiencies (PADs) are the most common primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). They can be divided into the following groups, depending on their immunological features: agammaglobulinemia; common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) isotype; hyper IgM isotype; light chain or functional deficiencies with normal B cell count; specific antibody deficiency with normal Ig concentrations and normal numbers of B cells and transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy. The role of vaccination in PADs is recognized as therapeutic, diagnostic and prognostic and may be used in patients with residual B-cell function to provide humoral immunity to specific infective agents. According to their content and mechanisms, vaccines are grouped as live attenuated, inactivated (conjugated, polysaccharide), mRNA or replication-deficient vector vaccines. Vaccination may be unsafe or less effective when using certain vaccines and in specific types of immunodeficiency. Inactivated vaccines can be administered in PAD patients even if they could not generate a protective response; live attenuated vaccines are not recommended in major antibody deficiencies. From December 2020, European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved vaccines against COVID-19 infection: according to ESID advises, those vaccinations are recommended in patients with PADs. No specific data are available on safety and efficacy in PAD patients.	Treatment
34228096	Risk of missing colorectal cancer with a COVID-adapted diagnostic pathway using quantitative faecal immunochemical testing. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has brought an unprecedented challenge to healthcare services. The authors' COVID-adapted pathway for suspected bowel cancer combines two quantitative faecal immunochemical tests (qFITs) with a standard CT scan with oral preparation (CT mini-prep). The aim of this study was to estimate the degree of risk mitigation and residual risk of undiagnosed colorectal cancer. METHOD: Decision-tree models were developed using a combination of data from the COVID-adapted pathway (April-May 2020), a local audit of qFIT for symptomatic patients performed since 2018, relevant data (prevalence of colorectal cancer and sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tools) obtained from literature and a local cancer data set, and expert opinion for any missing data. The considered diagnostic scenarios included: single qFIT; two qFITs; single qFIT and CT mini-prep; two qFITs and CT mini-prep (enriched pathway). These were compared to the standard diagnostic pathway (colonoscopy or CT virtual colonoscopy (CTVC)). RESULTS: The COVID-adapted pathway included 422 patients, whereas the audit of qFIT included more than 5000 patients. The risk of missing a colorectal cancer, if present, was estimated as high as 20.2 per cent with use of a single qFIT as a triage test. Using both a second qFIT and a CT mini-prep as add-on tests reduced the risk of missed cancer to 6.49 per cent. The trade-off was an increased rate of colonoscopy or CTVC, from 287 for a single qFIT to 418 for the double qFIT and CT mini-prep combination, per 1000 patients. CONCLUSION: Triage using qFIT alone could lead to a high rate of missed cancers. This may be reduced using CT mini-prep as an add-on test for triage to colonoscopy or CTVC.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34224766	Cardiac involvement in consecutive unselected hospitalized COVID-19 population: In-hospital evaluation and one-year follow-up. BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) can occur in COVID-19 and has impact on clinical course. Data on CVD prevalence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and sequelae in survivors is limited. Aim of this prospective study carried out on consecutive unselected COVID-19 population, was to assess: 1) CVD occurrence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 2) persistence or new onset of CVD at one-month and one-year follow-up. METHODS: Over 30 days n = 152 COVID-19 patients underwent cardiovascular evaluation. Standard electrocardiogram (ECG), Troponin and echocardiography were integrated by further tests when indicated. Medical history, arterial blood gas, blood tests, chest computed tomography and treatment were recorded. CVD was defined as the occurrence of a new condition during the hospitalization for COVID-19. Survivors attended a one-month follow-up visit and a one-year telephone follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-two patients (28%) experienced a wide spectrum of CVD with acute myocarditis being the most frequent. Death occurred in 32 patients (21%) and more frequently in patients who developed CVD (p = 0.032). After adjustment for confounders, CVD was independently associated with death occurrence. At one-month follow-up visit, 7 patients (9%) presented persistent or delayed CVD. At one-year telephone follow-up, 57 patients (48%) reported persistent symptoms. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular evaluation in COVID-19 patients is crucial since the occurrence of CVD in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is common (28%), requires specific treatment and increases the risk of in-hospital mortality. Persistence or delayed presentation of CVD at 1-month (9%) and persistent symptoms at 1-year follow-up (48%) suggest the need for monitoring COVID-19 survivors.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34348695	Co-distribution of Light At Night (LAN) and COVID-19 incidence in the United States. BACKGROUND: Light at night (LAN) as a circadian disruption factor may affect the human immune system and consequently increase an individual's susceptibility to the severity of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. COVID-19 infections spread differently in each state in the United States (US). The current analysis aimed to test whether there is an association between LAN and COVID-19 cases in 4 selected US states: Connecticut, New York, California, and Texas. METHODS: We analyzed clustering patterns of COVID-19 cases in ArcMap and performed a multiple linear regression model using data of LAN and COVID-19 incidence with adjustment for confounding variables including population density, percent below poverty, and racial factors. RESULTS: Hotspots of LAN and COVID-19 cases are located in large cities or metro-centers for all 4 states. LAN intensity is associated with cases/1 k for overall and lockdown durations in New York and Connecticut (P < 0.001), but not in Texas and California. The overall case rates are significantly associated with LAN in New York (P < 0.001) and Connecticut (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant positive correlation between LAN intensity and COVID-19 cases-rate/1 k, suggesting that circadian disruption of ambient light may increase the COVID-19 infection rate possibly by affecting an individual's immune functions. Furthermore, differences in the demographic structure and lockdown policies in different states play an important role in COVID-19 infections.	Prevention

BACKGROUND: In the article presented data about organization of the medical care over a period of 10 months at the Municipal Public Dental clinic in the metropolitan city such as Saint-Petersburg to the patients diagnosed with new coronavirus infection. AIM: Organization of the medical ambulatory care to the patients diagnosed with new coronavirus infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Layout decisions were utilized that enabled to organize the reception of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 without disrupting the scheduled mode of treatment of the dental patients. Saint Petersburg Budgetary Healthcare Facility <<Municipal Dental Clinic N 33>> provided dental service to 191 patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Whereas 159 patients were admitted for treatment at the contagious isolation ward, 89 patients were consulted via the use of telehealth technology and among them 39 received telemedical assistance service. Mean age of the patients treated in the isolated ward: children 8.6+/-3.6, adults 39.1+/-13.8 years. People of active working age comprised 72% of all adult patients. Males filed for dental assistance more than females (54%). ICD K04.5 was established diagnosis in 52% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: We managed to demonstrate high efficiency in utilizing telehealth technology. An issue of organizing medical dental care at the II level healthcare institution for adult population and for children diagnosed with new coronavirus infection COVID-19 in the heavy populated metropolis was solved.

34344026	[Title: Covid-19-associated coagulopathy]. COVID-19, primarily a respiratory disease, is considered a multi-systemic disease as symptom severity increases. Blood coagulation abnormalities are key features of patients with severe symptoms and indicative of the high risk of both venous and arterial thromboembolism in COVID-19. This prothrombotic condition caused by an interplay of the infectious agent, inflammation, and the blood coagulation system is referred to as COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and characterized by greatly increased D-dimer, high fibrinogen, an extended prothrombin time, and a reduced number of platelets. Due to this high thrombotic potential, prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended in all hospitalized patients. However, the optimal dosage of anticoagulation is still debated. In this article, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge about COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and discuss clinical therapeutic consequences.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34200036	"Protective Measures against COVID-19: Dental Practice and Infection Control. The onset of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged the worldwide healthcare sector, including dentistry. The highly infectious nature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and risk of transmission through aerosol generating procedures has profoundly impacted the delivery of dental care services globally. As dental practices with renewed infection control strategies and preventive measures are re-opening in the ""new normal"" period, it is the responsibility of healthcare professionals to constantly analyze new data and limit the spread of COVID-19 in dental care settings. In the light of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 rapidly emerging in different geographic locations, there is an urgent need to comply more than ever with the rigorous public health measures to mitigate COVID-19 transmission.

34222846	Centenarians and extremely old people living with frailty can elicit durable SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgG antibodies with virus neutralization functions following virus infection as determined by serological study. Background: The SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2) has led to more than 165 million COVID-19 cases and >3.4 million deaths worldwide. Epidemiological analysis has revealed that the risk of developing severe COVID-19 increases with age. Despite a disproportionate number of older individuals and long-term care facilities being affected by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, very little is understood about the immune responses and development of humoral immunity in the extremely old person after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we conducted a serological study to investigate the development of humoral immunity in centenarians following a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care facility. Methods: Extreme aged individuals and centenarians who were residents in a long-term care facility and infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were investigated between April and June 2020 for the development of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Blood samples were collected from positive and bystander individuals 30 and 60 days after original diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma was used to quantify IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes and subsequent subclasses of antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The function of anti-spike was then assessed by virus neutralization assays against the native SARS-CoV-2 virus. Findings: Fifteen long-term care residents were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All individuals had a Clinical Frailty scale score >/=5 and were of extreme older age or were centenarians. Six women with a median age of 98.8 years tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were the highest titers observed in our cohort with all IgG positive individuals having virus neutralization ability. Additionally, 5 out of the 6 positive participants had a robust IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 response. In all 5, antibodies were detected after 60 days from initial diagnosis.	Diagnosis

34204370	SARS-CoV-2 Infects Hamster Testes. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect millions of people worldwide. Although SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, there is growing concern that the disease could cause damage and pathology outside the lungs, including in the genital tract. Studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage the testes and reduce testosterone levels, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown and evidence of virus replication in testicular cells is lacking. We infected golden Syrian hamsters intranasally, a model for mild human COVID-19, and detected viral RNA in testes samples without histopathological changes up to one month post-infection. Using an ex vivo infection model, we detected SARS-CoV-2 replication in hamster testicular cells. Taken together, our data raise the possibility that testes damage observed in severe cases of COVID-19 could be partly explained by direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of the testicular cells.	Mechanism

34202340	Increase of Antimicrobial Consumption in a Tertiary Care Hospital during the First Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic poses novel challenges in antimicrobial consumption metrics and stewardship strategies. COVID-19 patients became the major cause of hospital admission during the first wave of the pandemic, often leading to an antimicrobial prescription upon admission or treatment for superinfections. The aim of this study was to understand how antimicrobial consumption was impacted at the beginning of the pandemic in a tertiary care hospital, a reference center for COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A retrospective before-and-after study was done. Descriptive statistics of discharges, patient-days, and antimicrobial use indicators (defined daily doses (DDD)/100 discharges, DDD/100 patient-days) for various groups were calculated for the first three months of the pandemic (March, April, and May 2020) as a quarterly value, and for each year in 2011-2019, and their annual percentage changes were used to estimate 95% confidence intervals. The indicators were compared to patient type (medical/surgical), type of admission (urgent/elective), and age groups using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results: Statistically significant increases occurred in 2020 for total antibacterials, macrolides, cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, carbapenems, meropenem, and third-generation cephalosporins, while a reduction was seen in cefazolin/cefoxitin. A correlation was found between antibacterial consumption and patient or admission type. In 2020, unlike in pre-pandemic years, there was a different impact in DDD/100 discharges and DDD/100 patient-days due to increased lengths-of-stay and longer antimicrobial therapy. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in antimicrobial consumption with a different impact in DDD/100 discharges and DDD/100 patient-days. This highlights the need to use both indicators simultaneously to better understand the causes of antimicrobial consumption variation and improve the design of effective antimicrobial stewardship interventions.

34281186	Possible Link between SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Parkinson's Disease: The Role of Toll-Like Receptor 4. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative motor disorder characterized by selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of the midbrain, depletion of dopamine (DA), and impaired nigrostriatal pathway. The pathological hallmark of PD includes the aggregation and accumulation alpha-synuclein (alpha-SYN). Although the precise mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PD are still unknown, the activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), mainly TLR4 and subsequent neuroinflammatory immune response, seem to play a significant role. Mounting evidence suggests that viral infection can concur with the precipitation of PD or parkinsonism. The recently identified coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), responsible for 160 million cases that led to the death of more than three million individuals worldwide. Studies have reported that many patients with COVID-19 display several neurological manifestations, including acute cerebrovascular diseases, conscious disturbance, and typical motor and non-motor symptoms accompanying PD. In this review, the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 and its possible involvement in the pathogenesis of PD are discussed. Specifically, the involvement of the TLR4 signaling pathway in mediating the virus entry, as well as the massive immune and inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients is explored. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to TLR4 and the possible interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and alpha-SYN as contributing factors to neuronal death are also considered.	Mechanism;Diagnosis
34283945	SARS-CoV-2 screening: effectiveness and risk of increasing transmission. Testing asymptomatic people for SARS-CoV-2 aims to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Screening programmes' effectiveness depends upon testing strategy, sample handling logistics, test sensitivity and individual behaviour, in addition to dynamics of viral transmission. The interaction between these factors is not fully characterized. We investigated the interaction between these factors to determine how to optimize reduction of transmission. We estimate that under idealistic assumptions 70% of transmission may be averted, but under realistic assumptions only 7% may be averted. We show that programmes that overwhelm laboratory capacity or reduce isolation of those with minor symptoms have increased transmission compared with those that do not: programmes need to be designed to avoid these issues, or they will be ineffective or even counter-productive. Our model allows optimal selection of whom to test, quantifies the balance between accuracy and timeliness, and quantifies potential impacts of behavioural interventions. We anticipate our model can be used to understand optimal screening strategies for other infectious diseases with substantially different dynamics.	Prevention
34211709	The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Since emerging from Wuhan, China, in December of 2019, the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been causing devastating severe respiratory infections in humans worldwide. With the disease spreading faster than the medical community could contain it, death tolls increased at an alarming rate worldwide, causing the World Health Organization to officially sanction the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a pandemic, leading to a state of worldwide lockdown for the majority of the year 2020. There have been reports of new strains of the virus emerging in various parts of the world, with some strains displaying even greater infectivity and transmissibility. Areas of the emerging variant of concern arise from countries like the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, and India. These mutations carry a lineage from N501Y, D614G, N439K, Y453F, and others, which are globally dominated by clades 20A, 20B, and 20C.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the variation of medical and surgical activities in pediatric orthopedics in Italy, during the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, in comparison with data from the previous two years. The differences among the first wave, phase 2 and second wave were also analyzed. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study regarding the clinical and surgical activities in pediatric orthopedics during the pandemic and pre-pandemic period. The hospital databases of seven tertiary referral centers for pediatric orthopedics and traumatology were queried for events regarding pediatric orthopedic patients from 1 March 2018 to 28 February 2021. Surgical procedures were classified according to the ""SITOP Priority Panel"". An additional classification in ""high-priority"" and ""low-priority"" surgery was also applied. RESULTS: Overall, in 2020, we observed a significant drop in surgical volumes compared to the previous two years. The decrease was different across the different classes of priority, with ""high-priority"" surgery being less influenced. The decrease in emergency department visits was almost three-fold greater than the decrease in trauma surgery. During the second wave, a lower decline in surgical interventions and a noticeable resumption of ""low-priority"" surgery and outpatient visits were observed. CONCLUSION: Our study represents the first nationwide survey quantifying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric orthopedics and traumatology during the first and second wave."	Prevention
34377058	IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON MENTAL HEALTH AND AGING. The potential ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population's mental health are a rising global concern. Both at the individual and community level, the erratic and uncertain COVID-19 outbreak has the prospective to exhibit a detrimental effect on psychological health and aging. At present, various measures are dedicated to the parameters like awareness of epidemiology, clinical aspects, mode of transmission, counteracting the spread of the infection, and public health problems, although this initiative has neglected critical mental health concerns. This study is to investigate the outbreak to study the level of harmful effects on mental health and its crosstalk with aging. Global execution of preventive, control measures and resilience establishment are challenging factors whereas reformed lifestyle such as lockdown, coping with self-isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and post-traumatic stress disorders are alarming. Hallmarks of aging which interact with each other, have been suggested to affect the healthspan in aged adults, possibly due to attenuated immunity. Among various hallmarks, we concentrated on those that show direct or indirect interaction with viral infections, comprising inflammation, genomic instability, impaired mitochondrial function, epigenetic modification, telomere attrition, and damaged autophagy. These hallmarks possibly contribute to the elicited pathophysiological responses to SARS-CoV-2 and may add an additive risk of accelerated aging post-recovery among aged adults. Here, the role of antiaging drug candidates that require main consideration in COVID-19 research is discussed briefly. In the later future, it can emerge as a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of patients with severe infection.	Mechanism;Treatment
34282465	SARS-CoV-2, myocardial injury and inflammation: insights from a large clinical and autopsy study. OBJECTIVE: Despite growing evidence about myocardial injury in hospitalized COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, the mechanism behind this injury is only poorly understood and little is known about its association with SARS-CoV-2-mediated myocarditis. Furthermore, definite evidence of the presence and role of SARS-CoV-2 in cardiomyocytes in the clinical scenario is still lacking. METHODS: We histologically characterized myocardial tissue of 40 patients deceased with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave of the pandemic. Clinical data were also recorded and analyzed. In case of findings supportive of myocardial inflammation, histological analysis was complemented by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens and in situ RNA hybridization for the detection of viral genomes. RESULTS: Both chronic and acute myocardial damage was invariably present, correlating with the age and comorbidities of our population. Myocarditis of overt entity was found in one case (2.5%). SARS-CoV-2 genome was not found in the cardiomyocytes of the patient with myocarditis, while it was focally and negligibly present in cardiomyocytes of patients with known viral persistence in the lungs and no signs of myocardial inflammation. The presence of myocardial injury was not associated with myocardial inflammatory infiltrates. CONCLUSIONS: In this autopsy cohort of COVID-19 patients, myocarditis is rarely found and not associated with SARS-CoV-2 presence in cardiomyocytes. Chronic and acute forms of myocardial damage are constantly found and correlate with the severity of COVID-19 disease and pre-existing comorbidities.	Diagnosis;Mechanism
34217208	"A mixed-methods study describing behavioral factors that influenced general practitioners' experiences using triage during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, general practices were asked to expand triage and to reduce unnecessary face-to-face contact by prioritizing other consultation modes, e.g., online messaging, video, or telephone. The current study explores the potential barriers and facilitators general practitioners experienced to expanding triage systems and their attitudes towards triage during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A mixed-method study design was used in which a quantitative online survey was conducted along with qualitative interviews to gain a more nuanced appreciation for practitioners' experiences in the United Kingdom. The survey items were informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework so they would capture 14 behavioral factors that may influence whether practitioners use triage systems. Items were responded to using seven-point Likert scales. A median score was calculated for each item. The responses of participants identifying as part-owners and non-owners (i.e., ""partner"" vs. ""non-partner"" practitioners) were compared. The semi-structured interviews were conducted remotely and examined using Braun and Clark's thematic analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 204 participants (66% Female). Most participants (83%) reported triaging patients. The items with the highest median scores captured the 'Knowledge,' 'Skills,' 'Social/Professional role and identity,' and 'Beliefs about capabilities' domains. The items with the lowest median scores captured the 'Beliefs about consequences,' 'Goals,' and 'Emotions' domains. For 14 of the 17 items, partner scores were higher than non-partner scores. All the qualitative interview participants relied on a phone triage system. Six broad themes were discovered: patient accessibility, confusions around what triage is, uncertainty and risk, relationships between service providers, job satisfaction, and the potential for total digital triage. Suggestions arose to optimize triage, such as ensuring there is sufficient time to conduct triage accurately and providing practical training to use triage efficiently. CONCLUSIONS: Many general practitioners are engaging with expanded triage systems, though more support is needed to achieve total triage across practices. Non-partner practitioners likely require more support to use the triage systems that practices take up. Additionally, practical support should be made available to help all practitioners manage the new risks and uncertainties they are likely to experience during non-face-to-face consultations."

34207510	Role of JAK/STAT in Interstitial Lung Diseases; Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms. Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) comprise different fibrotic lung disorders characterized by cellular proliferation, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis. The JAK/STAT molecular pathway is activated under the interaction of a broad number of profibrotic/pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-11, and IL-13, among others, which are increased in different ILDs. Similarly, several growth factors over-expressed in ILDs, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) activate JAK/STAT by canonical or non-canonical pathways, which indicates a predominant role of JAK/STAT in ILDs. Between the different JAK/STAT isoforms, it appears that JAK2/STAT3 are predominant, initiating cellular changes observed in ILDs. This review analyzes the expression and distribution of different JAK/STAT isoforms in ILDs lung tissue and different cell types related to ILDs, such as lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial type II cells and analyzes JAK/STAT activation. The effect of JAK/STAT phosphorylation on cellular fibrotic processes, such as proliferation, senescence, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, or epithelial/fibroblast to mesenchymal transition will be described. The small molecules directed to inhibit JAK/STAT activation were assayed in vitro and in in vivo models of pulmonary fibrosis, and different JAK inhibitors are currently approved for myeloproliferative disorders. Recent evidence indicates that JAK inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies directed to block IL-6 are used as compassionate use to attenuate the excessive inflammation and lung fibrosis related to SARS-CoV-2 virus. These altogether indicate that JAK/STAT pathway is an attractive target to be proven in future clinical trials of lung fibrotic disorders.	Mechanism;Treatment
34360473	Differential Kinetics of Cycle Threshold Values during Admission by Symptoms among Patients with Mild COVID-19: A Prospective Cohort Study. In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, more than half of the cases of transmission may occur via asymptomatic individuals, which makes it difficult to contain. However, whether viral load in the throat during admission is different between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients is not well known. By conducting a prospective cohort study of patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, cycle threshold (Ct) values of the polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 were examined every other day during admission. The Ct values during admission increased more steadily in symptomatic patients and febrile patients than in asymptomatic patients, with significance (p = 0.01 and p = 0.004, respectively), although the Ct values as a whole were not significantly different between the two groups. Moreover, the Ct values as a whole were higher in patients with dysosmia/dysgeusia than in those without it (p = 0.02), whereas they were lower in patients with a headache than those without (p = 0.01). Patients who were IgG-positive at discharge maintained higher Ct values, e.g., more than 35, during admission than those with IgG-negative (p = 0.03). Assuming that viral load and Ct values are negatively associated, the viral loads as a whole and their changes by time may be different by symptoms and immune reaction, i.e., IgG-positive at discharge.

34199198	Risk Factors of Infection, Hospitalization and Death from SARS-CoV-2: A Population-Based Cohort Study. We conducted a prospective population-based cohort study to assess risk factors for infection, hospitalization, and death from SARS-CoV-2. The study comprised the people covered by the Health Service of Navarre, Spain. Sociodemographic variables and chronic conditions were obtained from electronic healthcare databases. Confirmed infections, hospitalizations, and deaths from SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the enhanced epidemiological surveillance during the second SARS-CoV-2 epidemic surge (July-December 2020), in which diagnostic tests were widely available. Among 643,757 people, 5497 confirmed infections, 323 hospitalizations, 38 intensive care unit admissions, and 72 deaths from SARS-CoV-2 per 100,000 inhabitants were observed. A higher incidence of confirmed infection was associated with people aged 15-29 years, nursing home residents, healthcare workers, people born in Latin America or Africa, as well as in those diagnosed with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease, dementia, severe obesity, hypertension and functional dependence. The risk of hospitalization in the population was associated with males, higher age, nursing home residents, Latin American or African origin, and those diagnosed with immunodeficiency, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, COPD, asthma, kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, cirrhosis, dementia, severe obesity, hypertension and functional dependence. The risk of death was associated with males, higher age, nursing home residents, Latin American origin, low income level, immunodeficiency, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, COPD, kidney disease, dementia, and functional dependence. This study supports the prioritization of the older population, nursing home residents, and people with chronic conditions and functional dependence for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and vaccination, and highlights the need for additional preventive support for immigrants.

34291119	Pneumonia Caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and Influenza Virus: A Multicenter Comparative Study. Background: Detailed differences in clinical information between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia (CP), which is the main phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 disease, and influenza pneumonia (IP) are still unclear. Methods: A prospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted by including patients with CP who were hospitalized between January and June 2020 and a retrospective cohort of patients with IP hospitalized from 2009 to 2020. We compared the clinical presentations and studied the prognostic factors of CP and IP. Results: Compared with the IP group (n = 66), in the multivariate analysis, the CP group (n = 362) had a lower percentage of patients with underlying asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P < .01), lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P < .01), lower systolic blood pressure (P < .01), higher diastolic blood pressure (P < .01), lower aspartate aminotransferase level (P < .05), higher serum sodium level (P < .05), and more frequent multilobar infiltrates (P < .05). The diagnostic scoring system based on these findings showed excellent differentiation between CP and IP (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.889). Moreover, the prognostic predictors were different between CP and IP. Conclusions: Comprehensive differences between CP and IP were revealed, highlighting the need for early differentiation between these 2 pneumonias in clinical settings.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34366660	Adverse events related to COVID-19 vaccines: the need to strengthen pharmacovigilance monitoring systems. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new species of beta-coronavirus genus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The COVID-19 pandemic, which started in late 2019 and continues as at mid-2021, has caused enormous damage to health and lives globally. The urgent public health need has led to the development of vaccines against COVID-19 in record-breaking time. The COVID-19 vaccines have been widely rolled out for the masses by many countries following approval for emergency use by the World Health Organization and regulatory agencies in many countries. In addition, several COVID-19 vaccine candidates are undergoing clinical trials. However, myths, fears, rumors, and misconceptions persist, particularly in regard to adverse events. In this commentary, we describe the adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccines and discuss why it is essential to have a functional adverse event monitoring system in this context.	Treatment
34281029	Assessment and Impact of the Risk of Exposure of Portuguese Biomedical Scientists in the Context of COVID-19. Currently, the main public health concern worldwide is the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, which was recently discovered and described. Due to its high pathogenicity and infectiousness, it is necessary to determine the risk healthcare professionals face every day while dealing with infected patients and contaminated biological samples. The purpose of this study was to assess Portuguese Biomedical Scientists' risk of COVID-19 exposure and related stress appraisals. One hundred and forty participants completed online versions of the WHO's Risk Assessment and Management of Exposure Survey and the Stress Appraisal Measure. Participants worked mainly in outpatient settings (45%), and in emergency services (28%). Twenty three percent of participants were exposed to COVID-19 through community exposure, and 39% through occupational exposure. Although 95% reported using personal protective equipment (PPE), 83.6% were at high risk of infection. However, the use of some types of PPE was related to the risk of exposure. Participants reported moderate perceptions of stress and threat, but also moderate perceptions of control over the situation. These results may contribute to a more efficient risk management of these professionals and prevent disease transmission in hospitals and communities.	Prevention
34206453	"Immune Evasion of SARS-CoV-2 Emerging Variants: What Have We Learnt So Far? Despite the slow evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 relative to other RNA viruses, its massive and rapid transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic has enabled it to acquire significant genetic diversity since it first entered the human population. This led to the emergence of numerous variants, some of them recently being labeled ""variants of concern"" (VOC), due to their potential impact on transmission, morbidity/mortality, and the evasion of neutralization by antibodies elicited by infection, vaccination, or therapeutic application. The potential to evade neutralization is the result of diversity of the target epitopes generated by the accumulation of mutations in the spike protein. While three globally recognized VOCs (Alpha or B.1.1.7, Beta or B.1.351, and Gamma or P.1) remain sensitive to neutralization albeit at reduced levels by the sera of convalescent individuals and recipients of several anti-COVID19 vaccines, the effect of spike variability is much more evident on the neutralization capacity of monoclonal antibodies. The newly recognized VOC Delta or lineage B.1.617.2, as well as locally accepted VOCs (Epsilon or B.1.427/29-US and B1.1.7 with the E484K-UK) are indicating the necessity of close monitoring of new variants on a global level. The VOCs characteristics, their mutational patterns, and the role mutations play in immune evasion are summarized in this review."	Mechanism;Treatment
34359294	SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Detection to Expand Testing Capacity for COVID-19: Results from a Hospital Emergency Department Testing Site. BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection has currently expanded the testing capacity for COVID-19, which yet relies on the SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR amplification. OBJECTIVES: To report on a COVID-19 testing algorithm from a tertiary care hospital emergency department (ED) that combines both antigen (performed on the ED) and RT-PCR (performed outside the ED) testing. METHODS: Between December 2020 and January 2021, in a priori designated, spatially separated COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 ED areas, respectively, symptomatic or asymptomatic patients received SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing on nasopharyngeal swab samples. Antigen results were promptly accessible to guide subsequent, outside performed confirmatory (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS: Overall, 1083 (100%) of 1083 samples in the COVID-19 area and 1815 (49.4%) of 3670 samples in the non-COVID-19 area had antigen results that required confirmation by RT-PCR. Antigen positivity rates were 12.4% (134/1083) and 3.7% (66/1815), respectively. Compared to RT-PCR testing results, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of antigen testing were, respectively, 68.0%, 98.3%, 88.8%, and 94.1% in the COVID-19 area, and 41.9%, 97.3%, 27.3%, and 98.6% in non-COVID-19 area. Practically, RT-PCR tests were avoided in 50.6% (1855/3670) of non-COVID-19 area samples (all antigen negative) from patients who, otherwise, would have needed antigen result confirmation. CONCLUSIONS: Our algorithm had value to preserve RT-PCR from avoidable usage and, importantly, to save time, which translated into a timely RT-PCR result availability in the COVID-19 area.	Diagnosis
34223149	Antibiotic resistance during and beyond COVID-19. Antibiotics underpin the 'modern medicine' that has increased life expectancy, leading to societies with sizeable vulnerable elderly populations who have suffered disproportionately during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Governments have responded by shuttering economies, limiting social interactions and refocusing healthcare. There are implications for antibiotic resistance both during and after these events. During spring 2020, COVID-19-stressed ICUs relaxed stewardship, perhaps promoting resistance. Counterpoised to this, more citizens died at home and total hospital antibiotic use declined, reducing selection pressure. Restricted travel and social distancing potentially reduced community import and transmission of resistant bacteria, though hard data are lacking. The future depends on the vaccines now being deployed. Unequivocal vaccine success should allow a swift return to normality. Vaccine failure followed by extended and successful non-pharmaceutical suppression may lead to the same point, but only after some delay, and with indefinite travel restrictions; sustainability is doubtful. Alternatively, failure of vaccines and control measures may prompt acceptance that we must live with the virus, as in the prolonged 1889-94 'influenza' (or coronavirus OC43) pandemic. Vaccine failure scenarios, particularly those accepting 'learning to live with the virus', favour increased outpatient management of non-COVID-19 infections using oral and long t (1/2) antibiotics. Ultimately, all models-except those envisaging societal collapse-suggest that COVID-19 will be controlled and that hospitals will revert to pre-2020 patterns with a large backlog of non-COVID-19 patients awaiting treatment. Clearing this will increase workloads, stresses, nosocomial infections, antibiotic use and resistance. New antibiotics, including cefiderocol, are part of the answer.	Prevention
34334686	Effects of coronavirus disease 2019 on the digestive system and its nutritional implications. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There has been a deluge of scientific data since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported. The effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system are now increasingly well understood. This article aims to review the current data on the effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system with particular emphasis on preexisting digestive diseases and its implications on nutrition practices. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence has shown that Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus affects the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, pancreas and hepatobiliary system resulting in different GI manifestations. Several preexisting digestive diseases have been investigated. These studies have revealed that these special patient population groups are generally not at an increased risk to contract COVID-19, but are susceptible to develop increasing severity of disease. Aside from medical therapy, optimizing nutritional care has a beneficial role in this group of patients. SUMMARY: GI manifestations of COVID-19 in addition to preexisting digestive diseases have an impact on patient's nutrition. Digestion, absorption and transport of nutrients may be impaired. To date, there are no existing guidelines on the nutritional management of patients for this particular at-risk group. Most nutrition practices are based only on observations and clinical experience. Basic prepandemic nutrition care principles are primarily followed but often individualized based on clinical judgment.	Treatment
34360142	COVID-19 Prevention and Control Measures in Workplace Settings: A Rapid Review and Meta-Analysis. Workplaces can be high-risk environments for SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and subsequent community transmission. Identifying, understanding, and implementing effective workplace SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and control (IPC) measures is critical to protect workers, their families, and communities. A rapid review and meta-analysis were conducted to synthesize evidence assessing the effectiveness of COVID-19 IPC measures implemented in global workplace settings through April 2021. Medline, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies that quantitatively assessed the effectiveness of workplace COVID-19 IPC measures. The included studies comprised varying empirical designs and occupational settings. Measures of interest included surveillance measures, outbreak investigations, environmental adjustments, personal protective equipment (PPE), changes in work arrangements, and worker education. Sixty-one studies from healthcare, nursing home, meatpacking, manufacturing, and office settings were included, accounting for ~280,000 employees based in Europe, Asia, and North America. Meta-analyses showed that combined IPC measures resulted in lower employee COVID-19 positivity rates (0.2% positivity; 95% CI 0-0.4%) than single measures such as asymptomatic PCR testing (1.7%; 95% CI 0.9-2.9%) and universal masking (24%; 95% CI 3.4-55.5%). Modelling studies showed that combinations of (i) timely and widespread contact tracing and case isolation, (ii) facilitating smaller worker cohorts, and (iii) effective use of PPE can reduce workplace transmission. Comprehensive COVID-19 IPC measures incorporating swift contact tracing and case isolation, PPE, and facility zoning can effectively prevent workplace outbreaks. Masking alone should not be considered sufficient protection from SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in the workplace.	Prevention
34291555	Enzymatic Assays to Explore Viral mRNA Capping Machinery. In eukaryotes, mRNA is modified by the addition of the 7-methylguanosine (m(7) G) 5' cap to protect mRNA from premature degradation, thereby enhancing translation and enabling differentiation between self (endogenous) and non-self RNAs (e. g., viral ones). Viruses often develop their own mRNA capping pathways to augment the expression of their proteins and escape host innate immune response. Insights into this capping system may provide new ideas for therapeutic interventions and facilitate drug discovery, e. g., against viruses that cause pandemic outbreaks, such as beta-coronaviruses SARS-CoV (2002), MARS-CoV (2012), and the most recent SARS-CoV-2. Thus, proper methods for the screening of large compound libraries are required to identify lead structures that could serve as a basis for rational antiviral drug design. This review summarizes the methods that allow the monitoring of the activity and inhibition of enzymes involved in mRNA capping.	Mechanism;Treatment
34204119	Usefulness of Respiratory Mechanics and Laboratory Parameter Trends as Markers of Early Treatment Success in Mechanically Ventilated Severe Coronavirus Disease: A Single-Center Pilot Study. Whether a patient with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will be successfully liberated from mechanical ventilation (MV) early is important in the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to characterize the time course of parameters and outcomes of severe COVID-19 in relation to the timing of liberation from MV. This retrospective, single-center, observational study was performed using data from mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU between 1 March 2020 and 15 December 2020. Early liberation from ventilation (EL group) was defined as successful extubation within 10 days of MV. The trends of respiratory mechanics and laboratory data were visualized and compared between the EL and prolonged MV (PMV) groups using smoothing spline and linear mixed effect models. Of 52 admitted patients, 31 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients were included (EL group, 20 (69%); PMV group, 11 (31%)). The patients' median age was 71 years. While in-hospital mortality was low (6%), activities of daily living (ADL) at the time of hospital discharge were significantly impaired in the PMV group compared to the EL group (mean Barthel index (range): 30 (7.5-95) versus 2.5 (0-22.5), p = 0.048). The trends in respiratory compliance were different between patients in the EL and PMV groups. An increasing trend in the ventilatory ratio during MV until approximately 2 weeks was observed in both groups. The interaction between daily change and earlier liberation was significant in the trajectory of the thrombin-antithrombin complex, antithrombin 3, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) values. The indicator of physiological dead space increases during MV. The trajectory of markers of the hypercoagulation status, inflammation, and PEEP were significantly different depending on the timing of liberation from MV. These findings may provide insight into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 during treatment in the critical care setting.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34228511	Descriptive Comparative Analysis of Patients With Cancer Referring to the Emergency Department of an Italian University Hospital Across the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Waves. PURPOSE: COVID-19 cancer patients (C19-CP) represent a population at high risk for mortality, whose clinical characteristics are still unknown in the second SARS-CoV-2 wave. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare epidemiology and clinical presentation of C19-CP referring to the emergency department (ED) of our institution (San Luigi Gonzaga University Hospital, Orbassano, Turin, Italy), in a 3-week observation period of the first and second COVID-19 waves, starting from the introduction of the corresponding national lockdowns. METHODS: We retrieved ED admissions from March 9 to 29, 2020, for the first wave, and from October 24 to November 13, 2020, for the second wave. We collected clinical characteristics of consecutive patients with molecularly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also considered untested or SARS-CoV-2-negative cancer patients referring to the ED in the reference time frames. RESULTS: C19-CP in the second wave exceeded those in the first wave despite the nonsignificant difference (39 of 576 v 8 of 163; P = .5). Compared with nononcological patients, C19-CP were older (median age 70 years [interquartile range 61-77] v 60 years [interquartile range 45-73]; P = .02) and presented more often with >/= 2 comorbidities (40.4% v 24.3%; P = .02). Compared with nononcological patients, in C19-CP, respiratory failure (29 of 47 v 321 of 692; P = .049) and hospitalization (37 of 47 v 363 of 692; P = .0004) were higher, with comparable frequencies across the waves. Five of 24 and 10 of 27 hospitalized cancer patients in the first and second waves developed SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: C19-CP were a vulnerable population, irrespective of the COVID-19 waves. This highlights the need to prioritize vaccinations in oncological patients to safeguard and guarantee optimal anticancer care.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34226900	Lessons learnt from COVID-19 coagulopathy. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has already left an indelible mark in human lives. Despite the havoc it created, this pandemic also saw significant advances in the management of an infectious disease wherein worldwide collaborative efforts from health care professionals have been unprecedented. One of the commonest complications recognised early in the pandemic is the development of coagulopathy. In this review, the lessons learnt from COVID-19 coagulopathy are summarised with some perspectives on future clinical and research strategies. These include how local versus systemic coagulopathy can matter, how we can put D-dimers to effective use, exhort more input into identifying a simple platelet activation marker, rethink the role of fibrinogen, look differently at lupus anticoagulant and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, bring back disseminated intravascular coagulation into our differential diagnosis slate and most importantly channel more funding into haemostasis and thrombosis research.

34218774	Nanotechnology-Based Approaches and Investigational Therapeutics against COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus which is currently responsible for the global pandemic since December 2019. This class of coronavirus has affected 217 countries around the world. Most of the countries have taken some non-remedial preventive actions like country lockdown, work from home, travel bans, and the most significant one is social isolation. Pharmacists, doctors, nurses, technologists, and all other healthcare professionals are playing a pivotal role during this pandemic. Unluckily, there is no specific drug that can treat patients who are confirmed with COVID-19, though favipiravir and remdesivir have appeared as favorable antiviral drugs. Some vaccines have already developed, and vaccination has started worldwide. Different nanotechnologies are in the developing stage in many countries for preventing SARS-COV-2 and treating COVID-19 conditions. In this article, we review the COVID-19 pandemic situation as well as the nanotechnology-based approaches and investigational therapeutics against COVID-19.	Treatment
