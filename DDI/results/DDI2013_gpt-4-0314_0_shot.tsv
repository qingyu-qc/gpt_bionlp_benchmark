DDI-DrugBank.d752.s6.p2	Inducers of CYP3A4 Isozymes: Cytochrome P450 inducers, such as @DRUG$, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, induce metabolism and caused a markedly decreased C max and AUC of oral @DRUG$ in adult studies.	DDI-mechanism	DDI-mechanism	DDI-mechanism
DDI-DrugBank.d775.s11.p1	The neuromuscular blocking effect of @DRUG$ may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, @DRUG$, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase . Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine.

DDI-DrugBank.d743.s9.p5	Macrolides: Clinical drug interaction studies indicate that @DRUG$ and clarithromycin can exert an effect on @DRUG$ metabolism by a mechanism which may be similar to that of ketoconazole, but to a lesser extent.	DDI-mechanism	DDI-mechanism	DDI-mechanism
DDI-DrugBank.d776.s36.p0	This effect on @DRUG$ appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of @DRUG$ than with fluconazole administered intravenously.	DDI-effect	DDI-effect	DDI-effect
DDI-DrugBank.d711.s1.p2	Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving @DRUG$ in conjunction with @DRUG$.	DDI-advise	DDI-advise	DDI-advise
DDI-DrugBank.d737.s6.p80	Other drugs eliminated via renal secretion: Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that coadministration of drugs that are secreted by the cationic transport system (e.g., cimetidine, ranitidine, diltiazem, triamterene, verapamil, quinidine, and quinine) decreases the oral clearance of pramipexole by about 20%, while those secreted by the anionic transport system (e.g., @DRUG$, penicillins, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, and chlorpropamide) are likely to have little effect on the oral clearance of @DRUG$.

DDI-DrugBank.d603.s5.p65	ProAmatine. Alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, such as prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin, can antagonize the effects of ProAmatine. Potential for Drug Interactions: It appears possible, although there is no supporting experimental evidence, that the high renal clearance of @DRUG$ (a base) is due to active tubular secretion by the base-secreting system also responsible for the secretion of such drugs as metformin, cimetidine, @DRUG$, procainamide, triamterene, flecainide, and quinidine.

DDI-DrugBank.d639.s0.p4	Co-administration of @DRUG$ with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, @DRUG$, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconizole) may increases sunitinib concentrations.

DDI-DrugBank.d763.s3.p24	Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, @DRUG$, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and @DRUG$ blood concentrations were decreased.
