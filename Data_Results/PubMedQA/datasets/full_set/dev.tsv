Is cytokeratin immunoreactivity useful in the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea?	"[""Cytokeratin 7/20 staining has been reported to be helpful in diagnosing Barrett's oesophagus and gastric intestinal metaplasia. However, this is still a matter of some controversy."", ""To determine the diagnostic usefulness of cytokeratin 7/20 immunostaining for short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea."", ""In patients with Barrett's oesophagus, diagnosed endoscopically, at least two biopsy specimens were taken from just below the squamocolumnar junction. If goblet cells were found histologically with alcian blue staining, cytokeratin 7/20 immunohistochemical stains were performed. Intestinal metaplasia at the cardia was diagnosed whenever biopsy specimens taken from within 2 cm below the oesophagogastric junction revealed intestinal metaplasia.

Is extended aortic replacement in acute type A dissection justifiable?	['The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our surgical strategy for acute aortic dissection based on the extent of the dissection and the site of the entry, with special emphasis on resection of all dissected aortic segments if technically possible.', 'Between January 1995 and March 2001, 43 consecutive patients underwent operations for acute aortic dissection. In all patients the distal repair was performed under circulatory arrest without the use of an aortic cross-clamp. Fifteen patients underwent aortic arch replacement with additional reconstruction of supra-aortic vessels in 3 patients. Complete replacement of all dissected tissue could be achieved in 21 patients (group 1). Because of the distal extent of the dissection beyond the aortic arch, replacement of all the dissected tissue was not possible in 22 patients (group 2).', 'Early mortality was 4.7% (2 patients), and the incidence of perioperative cerebrovascular events was 7.0% (3 patients). All of these events occurred in group 2 (p<0.025). During the follow-up period of 6 years or less, 5 patients died, all from causes not related to the aorta or the aortic valve. A persisting patent false lumen was observed in 14 of the 36 surviving patients (39%).']	['BACKGROUND', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS']	['Aged', 'Anastomosis, Surgical', 'Aneurysm, Dissecting', 'Aortic Aneurysm', 'Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation', 'Brachiocephalic Trunk', 'Cardiac Surgical Procedures', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']	2003	no	yes	yes	Extended replacement of the dissected ascending aorta and aortic arch can be done with good early and midterm results, even though it requires a complex surgical technique. Therefore we advocate complete replacement of the dissected parts of the aorta in all patients in whom this is technically possible.	12607666
Is double-balloon enteroscopy an accurate method to diagnose small-bowel disorders?

Does tranexamic acid reduce desmopressin-induced hyperfibrinolysis?	['Desmopressin releases tissue-type plasminogen activator, which augments cardiopulmonary bypass--associated hyperfibrinolysis, causing excessive bleeding. Combined use of desmopressin with prior administration of the antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid may decrease fibrinolytic activity and might improve postoperative hemostasis.', 'This prospective randomized study was carried out with 100 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operations between April 1999 and November 2000 in Gülhane Military Medical Academy. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Desmopressin (0.3 microg/kg) was administrated just after cardiopulmonary bypass and after protamine infusion in group 1 (n = 50).

Should ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements be estimated in hospitalized alcoholic cirrotics?	['Ascitis and undernutrition are frequent complications of cirrhosis, however ascitis volume and anthropometric assessment are not routinely documented or considered in prognostic evaluation. In a homogeneous cohort followed during two years these variables were scrutinized, aiming to ascertain relevance for longterm outcome.', 'Population (N = 25, all males with alcoholic cirrhosis) was recruited among patients hospitalized for uncomplicated ascitis. Exclusion criteria were refractory or tense ascitis, cancer, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bleeding varices and critical illness. Measurements included ultrasonographically estimated ascitis volume, dry body mass index/BMI , upper arm anthropometrics, hematologic counts and liver function tests.', 'Population (age 48.3 ± 11.3 years, BMI 21.1 ± 3.5 kg/m², serum albumin 2.5 ± 0.8 g/dL) was mostly in the Child-Pugh C category (77.8%) but clinically stable. During the follow-up period of 22.6 ± 3.8 months, additional hospitalizations numbered 1.7 ± 1.0 and more than one quarter succumbed. Admission ascitis volume corresponded to 7.1 ± 3.6 L and dry BMI to 18.3 ± 3.5 kg/m². Child Pugh index was relevant for both mortality and rehospitalization.

Does the leukocyte count correlate with the severity of injury?	['Injury severity score (ISS), Glasgow coma score (GCS), and revised trauma score (RTS) are the most frequently used methods to evaluate the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients. ISS is too complicated to assess easily and GCS and RTS are easy to assess but somewhat subjective. White blood cell count (WBC) is an easy, quick and objective test.

Elephant trunk in a small-calibre true lumen for chronic aortic dissection: cause of haemolytic anaemia?	['The elephant trunk technique for aortic dissection is useful for reducing false lumen pressure; however, a folded vascular prosthesis inside the aorta can cause haemolysis. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether an elephant trunk in a small-calibre lumen can cause haemolysis.', 'Inpatient and outpatient records were retrospectively reviewed.', 'Two cases of haemolytic anaemia after aortic surgery using the elephant trunk technique were identified from 2011 to 2013.

A two-stage surgery was scheduled. Total arch replacement with an elephant trunk in the true lumen and concomitant aortic valve replacement were performed. Postoperatively, he developed severe haemolytic anaemia because of the folded elephant trunk. The anaemia improved after the second surgery, including graft replacement of the descending aorta. Similarly, a 61-year-old man, who underwent total arch replacement for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection, presented with enlargement of the chronic dissection of the descending aorta. Graft replacement of the descending aorta with an elephant trunk inserted into the true lumen was performed.

Estimation of basal metabolic rate in Chinese: are the current prediction equations applicable?	['Measurement of basal metabolic rate (BMR) is suggested as a tool to estimate energy requirements. Therefore, BMR prediction equations have been developed in multiple populations because indirect calorimetry is not always feasible.

Scrotal approach to both palpable and impalpable undescended testes: should it become our first choice?	['To determine the advantages of scrotal incision in the treatment of undescended testis. Undescended testis is a common pediatric condition and is conventionally managed surgically by orchidopexy. A single scrotal incision orchidopexy has become accepted as a valid approach for patients with palpable undescended testicles. Because this approach also allows easy detection of atrophic testes or testicular remnants, it recently has also emerged as an alternative initial surgical approach to impalpable undescended testicles.', 'All orchidopexies performed between 2004 and 2008 at our university hospital were prospectively included in this study. A total of 194 scrotal orchidopexies were performed in 154 patients (mean age, 71 months; range, 4-229 months). In all cases a scrotal approach was chosen irrespective of the initial position or presence of an open processus vaginalis. Testicular position was examined at follow-up after a mean period of 10 months (3-22 months).', 'Overall, 36 of the 46 impalpable testicles (78%) could be diagnosed and treated accordingly, using only a scrotal incision. Conversion to laparoscopy was needed in 4 cases. A limited number of postoperative complications were seen. In all cases, the testes were palpable and remained in the scrotum on follow-up.']	['OBJECTIVES', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS']	['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cryptorchidism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Palpation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Scrotum', 'Urologic Surgical Procedures, Male', 'Young Adult']	2010	yes	yes	yes	Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.	20156655
Does screening or surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improve the prognosis of patients?	['The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasonographic screening for primary hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'A total of 680 eligible cases were classified into three groups (surveillance, opportunistic, and symptomatic groups) according to their initial exposure.

Systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring: is it helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry?	['The gap between evidence-based treatments and routine care has been well established. Findings from the Sequenced Treatments Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) emphasized the importance of measurement-based care for the treatment of depression as a key ingredient for achieving response and remission; yet measurement-based care approaches are not commonly used in clinical practice.', 'The Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for monitoring depression severity was introduced in 19 diverse psychiatric practices. During the one-year course of the project the helpfulness and feasibility of implementation of PHQ-9 in these psychiatric practices were studied. The project was modeled after the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Breakthrough Series. Two of the 19 practices dropped out during the course of the project.', 'By the conclusion of the study, all remaining 17 practices had adopted PHQ-9 as a routine part of depression care in their practice. On the basis of responses from 17 psychiatrists from those practices, PHQ-9 scores influenced clinical decision making for 93% of 6,096 patient contacts. With the additional information gained from the PHQ-9 score, one or more treatment changes occurred during 40% of these clinical contacts. Changing the dosage of antidepressant medication and adding another medication were the most common treatment changes recorded by psychiatrists, followed by starting or increasing psychotherapy and by switching or initiating antidepressants. In 3% of the patient contacts, using the PHQ-9 led to additional suicide risk assessment.']	['OBJECTIVE', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS']	['Depression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Participation', 'Psychiatry', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States']	2008	yes	yes	yes	The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.	18832500

Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care?	['Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003.', 'Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients.

However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff.

Does a family meetings intervention prevent depression and anxiety in family caregivers of dementia patients?	['Family caregivers of dementia patients are at increased risk of developing depression or anxiety. A multi-component program designed to mobilize support of family networks demonstrated effectiveness in decreasing depressive symptoms in caregivers. However, the impact of an intervention consisting solely of family meetings on depression and anxiety has not yet been evaluated. This study examines the preventive effects of family meetings for primary caregivers of community-dwelling dementia patients.', 'A randomized multicenter trial was conducted among 192 primary caregivers of community dwelling dementia patients. Caregivers did not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive or anxiety disorder at baseline. Participants were randomized to the family meetings intervention (n\u200a=\u200a96) or usual care (n\u200a=\u200a96) condition. The intervention consisted of two individual sessions and four family meetings which occurred once every 2 to 3 months for a year. Outcome measures after 12 months were the incidence of a clinical depressive or anxiety disorder and change in depressive and anxiety symptoms (primary outcomes), caregiver burden and quality of life (secondary outcomes). Intention-to-treat as well as per protocol analyses were performed.', 'A substantial number of caregivers (72/192) developed a depressive or anxiety disorder within 12 months. The intervention was not superior to usual care either in reducing the risk of disorder onset (adjusted IRR 0.98; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.38) or in reducing depressive (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient\u200a=\u200a-1.40; 95% CI -3.91 to 1.10) or anxiety symptoms (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient\u200a=\u200a-0.55; 95% CI -1.59 to 0.49).

A woman's decision to go for screening is influenced by her social support network. This study aims to explore Jordanian men's individual and contextual perspectives on women's breast cancer and their own role in the breast health of the females within their families."", 'An explorative qualitative design was used to purposively recruit 24 married men aged 27 to 65\xa0years (median 43\xa0years) from four governorates in Jordan. Data in the form of interviews transcriptions was subjected to qualitative content analysis.', ""Three themes were identified: a) Supporting one's wife; b) Marital needs and obligations; c) Constrained by a culture of destiny and shame. The first theme was built on men's feelings of responsibility for the family's health and well-being, their experiences of encouraging their wives to seek health care and their providing counselling and instrumental support. The second theme emerged from men's views about other men's rejection of a wife inflicted by breast cancer, their own perceptions of diminished femininity due to mastectomy and their own concerns about protecting the family from the hereditary risk of breast cancer. The third theme was seen in men's perception of breast cancer as an inevitable act of God that is far away from one's own family, in associating breast cancer with improper behaviour and in their readiness to face the culture of Eib (shame).""]"	['BACKGROUND', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS']	['Adult', 'Aged', 'Attitude to Health', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Jordan', 'Male', 'Mastectomy', 'Men', 'Middle Aged', 'Qualitative Research', 'Social Support', 'Spouses']	2013	maybe	maybe	maybe	Jordanian men perceive themselves as having a vital role in supporting, guiding and encouraging their wives to follow breast cancer early detection recommendations.

Can the Internet be used to improve sexual health awareness in web-wise young people?	"['To assess Internet use amongst young people to determine whether it would be a practical way to provide sex education and information.', 'Year 10 students (aged 14-15 years) from North Nottinghamshire schools were asked to participate in focus groups to discuss the Internet. A series of predefined questions were directed to the whole group to generate debate. Areas explored included: Internet access and site; frequency and purpose of Internet use; websites visited; ideas for a genitourinary medicine (GUM) website. Responses were recorded by a hand count or as individual verbal responses.', ""Thirteen focus groups were held involving 287 students of approximately equal sex distribution. All had access to Internet facilities at school and 224 (78.0%) had access elsewhere. Access was at least once a week by 178 (62.0%) mostly for e-mail, games, chatlines and homework. No one accessed for health information. One hundred and seventy-nine (62.4%) participants said they would use a GUM website. A 'question line' where they could e-mail questions to a health care professional was of interest to 202 (70.4%) participants.""]"	['OBJECTIVES', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS']	['Adolescent', 'England', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Education', 'Humans', 'Information Dissemination', 'Internet', 'Male', 'Public Health', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Safe Sex', 'School Health Services', 'Sex Education']	2003	maybe	yes	maybe	The Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and websites they enjoy.	12626177
