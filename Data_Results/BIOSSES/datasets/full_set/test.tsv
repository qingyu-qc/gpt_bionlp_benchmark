0	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	It has been shown, however, that ubiquitination of cyclin D1 can efficiently take place following phosphorylation of another site, or without the apparent requirement for phosphorylation.	APC-dependent degradation of cyclin D1 does not require threonine 286 phosphorylation, but the presence of a “cyclin degradation box”, however, as observed in the present study, threonine 286 phosphorylation is essential for proteolytic degradation of cyclin D1 in skin	3.0
1	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Ironically, Rest has recently been described as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene.	In human epithelial cells REST has been described as a potent suppressor of malignant transformation and its deregulation has been associated with several non-neural tumors including breast and small cell lung cancers	3.2
2	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	In PC9 cells, loss of GATA6 and/or HOPX did not alter cell growth whereas reduction of GATA2 and EGFR inhibited cell viability as previously reported.	It has been shown that the activities of many regulatory factors of checkpoints are lost or arrested during the process of tumorigenesis.	0.2
3	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	MiR-223 seems to be a target molecule of TFs regulating granulopoiesis.	Feedback loops in which a miRNA-regulated transcription factor regulates the transcription of its cognate miRNA have been described in a number of animals.	1.2
4	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	BAF53 and β-actin subunits have been implicated in mammalian SWI/SNF-regulated binding to the chromatin/nuclear matrix.	β-actin and actin-related proteins have been found in the various ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes	3.0
5	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	All known GEFs reconfigure the nucleotide-binding pocket, often opening it by rearranging the switch regions.	A characteristic of GEFs is their strong preference for binding nucleotide-free over nucleotide-loaded GTPases.	2.0
6	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Alterations in Oct-4 expression promote differentiation and leads to the specification of ectodermal, endodermal or mesodermal primitive progenitors.	Additionally, expression of OCT4 and SOX2 has been shown to affect early differentiation genes such as SOX-17 expression.	1.8
7	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Furthermore, a very recent study demonstrated the mechanism that specifies myeloid expression of miR-223 and proposed a unique “minicircuitry” comprised of miR-223 and transcription factors, NFI-A and CAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα)	miR-223 regulates granulopoiesis by a feedback mechanism and is modulated competitively by the transcription factors nuclear factor I/A (NFI-A) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα).	3.4
8	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Lung tumour formation in mice by oncogenic KRAS requires CRaf, but not BRaf.	The oncogenic activity of mutant Kras appears dependent on functional Craf  but not on Braf.	3.4
9	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	With respect to LATS2, it has been reported that LATS2 induces G2/M arrest and subsequent apoptotic cell death.	The expression of miR-146a has been found to be up-regulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer  and cervical cancer.	0.2
10	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Considerable evidence indicates that cancer cells develop dependencies on normal functions of certain genes that can potentially be exploited to improve therapeutic strategies.	In the case of cell response to stress, cyclin D1 can be degraded through its binding to the anaphase-promoting complex and a RXXL sequence located in the NH2-terminal part of the protein.	0.0
11	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Consequently miRNAs have been demonstrated to act either as oncogenes (e.g., miR-155, miR-17−5p and miR-21)  or tumor suppressors (e.g., miR-34, miR-15a, miR-16−1 and let-7)	The extent to which miRNAs specifically affect metastasis remains unclear, as all the miRNAs reported to affect metastasis also exert potentially confounding influences on primary tumor development, apoptosis, and/or cell proliferation	2.8
12	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Recently, it was reported that expression of IDH1R132H suppresses TET2 activity and the mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 genes occur in a mutual exclusive manner with that of TET2 gene in AML	the mechanism was clarified by yet another genomic survey, this time involving acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).	1.6
13	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	A recent study identified the importance of the GATA2 transcriptional network in RAS oncogene-driven NSCLC and suggested effective combinations targeting the proteasome together with IL-1 and Rho-signalling.	Alternatively, the anaphase promoting complex (APC) is responsible for the rapid degradation of cyclin D1 in cells irradiated with ionizing radiation.	0.2
14	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Alterations in Oct-4 expression promote differentiation and leads to the specification of ectodermal, endodermal or mesodermal primitive progenitors.	OCT4, a transcript of POU5F1, plays a role in maintaining stem cell pluripotency, self-renewal and chromatin structure in stem cells, and promotes tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner.	1.6
15	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	In myelopoiesis, miR-223 has been shown to regulate granulocyte development in both humans and mice.	As shown previously, miR-223 is highly conserved, and its myeloid-specific expression is also well characterized in both human and mouse	3.6
16	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Changes in miR-146a and miR-146b expression and/or binding have also been implicated in the metastatic and proliferative response associated with the development of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer and pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer.	Additionally, loss of LATS2 stimulated reduplication, an activity comparable to that observed when Cyclin E is overexpressed in the absence of p53	0.2
17	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Expression of an activated form of Ras proteins can induce senescence in some primary fibroblasts.	The senescent state has been observed to be inducible in certain cultured cells in response to high level expression of genes such as the activated ras oncogene.	3.6
18	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	To directly measure the effect of endogenous Dnd1 on the activity of endogenous miR-372 family, we used sensor molecules containing the luciferase gene under the control of either wild-type LATS2-3′UTR or a mutant in the 372 target sites	The 3′UTRs of p27 and connexin-43 were PCR amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into pGL3 (Promega) downstream of the luciferase gene; constructs bearing the LATS2 3′UTR were described.	1.8
19	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Recently, miR-126 was identified as a metastasis suppressing miRNA that is downregulated in relapsing breast cancer, leukemia, and cervical cancer.	MiR-155 is upregulated in several human tumors, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, clear-cell kidney cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoma, thyroid carcinoma], breast cancer, colon cancer, cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer.	2.0
