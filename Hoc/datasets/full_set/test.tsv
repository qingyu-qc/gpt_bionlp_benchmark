11872299	PURPOSE We recently reported that overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) positively correlated with radioresistance of murine carcinomas . Because cyclin D1 is a downstream sensor of EGFR activation , the present study investigated whether a relationship exists between the extent of cyclin D1 expression and in vivo radiocurability of murine tumors . We further investigated the influence of radiation on cyclin D1 expression and the expression of p27 , an inhibitor of the cyclin D1 downstream pathway , as well as the relationship of these molecular determinants to cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in tumors exposed to radiation . METHODS AND MATERIALS Cyclin D1 expression was assayed in nine carcinomas syngeneic to C3Hf/Kam mice using Western blot analysis . These tumors greatly differed in their radioresponse as assessed by TCD(50) . The expression of cyclin D1 and p27 proteins was determined by Western blotting . Cell proliferative activity in tumors was determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) immunochemistry . The effect of irradiation on the expression of cyclin D1 or p27 proteins and on PCNA positivity was determined in the radiosensitive OCa-I and in the radioresistant SCC-VII tumors . RESULTS Cyclin D1 expression varied among tumors by 40-fold , and its magnitude positively correlated with poorer tumor radioresponse ( higher TCD(50) values ) . The level of cyclin D1 expression paralleled that of EGFR . A 15-Gy dose reduced constitutive expression of cyclin D1 in the radiosensitive OCa-I tumors , but had no influence on expression of cyclin D1 in the radioresistant SCC-VII tumors . In contrast , 15 Gy increased the expression of p27 in radiosensitive tumors and reduced it in radioresistant tumors . Radiation induced no significant apoptosis or change in the percentage of PCNA-positive ( proliferating ) cells in SCC-VII tumors with high cyclin D1 levels , but it induced significant apoptosis and a decrease in the percentage of proliferating cells in OCa-I tumors with low cyclin D1 expression . CONCLUSION Our findings show a positive correlation between cyclin D1 expression and tumor radioresistance . The expression of cyclin D1 and p27 was modified by radiation and was associated with cellular response to radiation , but this depended on the pretreatment level of cyclin D1 expression . These findings may have important clinical implications : The pretreatment assessment of cyclin D1 expression could serve as a useful predictor of radiotherapy outcome and assist in selecting an effective treatment modality .	sustaining proliferative signaling;evading growth suppressors;resisting cell death
11927016	"We have used a combination of vitamin A ( all-trans-retinyl palmitate ) , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) and radiation to treat human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . This chemoradiotherapy is called "" FAR therapy. "" In this study we examined the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , the active metabolite of vitamin A , and ATRA plus 5-FU on two HNSCC cell lines ( YCU-N861 and YCU-H891 ) to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of FAR therapy . ATRA at 1 mM ( the order of concentration found in HNSCC tumors treated with FAR therapy ) inhibited cell proliferation and caused G1 cell cycle arrest in both cell lines . This was associated with a decrease in cyclin D1 , an increase in p27(Kip1) and a reduction in the hyperphosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) . With YCU-N861 cells , ATRA also caused a decrease in Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) and an increase in Bax . Both ATRA and 5-FU activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) 1 and the combination of both agents resulted in additive or synergistic activation of JNK1 , and also enhanced the induction of apoptosis . The YCU-H891 cells , in which the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( Stat3 ) pathway is constitutively activated , were more resistant to treatments with ATRA , 5-FU and the combination of both agents than YCU-N861 cells . A dominant negative Stat3 construct strongly enhanced the cellular sensitivity of this cell line to 5-FU but not to ATRA . In addition there is evidence that activation of Stat3 is associated with cellular resistance to radiation in HNSCC . Therefore , the addition to FAR therapy of agents that inhibit activation of the Stat3 pathway may enhance the clinical response of patients with HNSCC to FAR therapy ."	sustaining proliferative signaling;evading growth suppressors;resisting cell death
12011225	BACKGROUND Insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) stimulates cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in the lung and other tissues by interacting with the IGF-I receptor . The major binding protein for IGF-I , insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 ( IGFBP-3 ) , modulates the effects of IGF-I but also inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis independent of IGF-I and its receptor . In a prospective study of men in Shanghai , China , we examined the association between serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and the subsequent risk of lung cancer . METHODS From 1986 to 1989 , serum was collected from 18,244 men aged 45-64 years living in Shanghai without a history of cancer . We analyzed IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels in serum from 230 case patients who developed incident lung cancer during follow-up and from 740 control subjects . RESULTS Among 230 case patients and 659 matched control subjects , increased IGF-I levels were not associated with increased risk of lung cancer . However , for subjects in the highest quartile relative to the lowest quartile of IGFBP-3 , the odds ratio ( OR ) for lung cancer , adjusted for smoking and IGF-I , was 0.50 ( 95% confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.25 to 1.02 ) . When the analysis was restricted to ever smokers ( 184 case patients and 344 matched control subjects ) , the OR for lung cancer in men in the highest quartile of IGFBP-3 relative to those in the lowest quartile , adjusted for smoking and IGF-I , was 0.41 ( 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.92 ) . CONCLUSIONS In this prospective study of Chinese men , higher serum levels of IGF-I did not increase the risk of lung cancer . However , subjects with higher serum levels of IGFBP-3 were at reduced risk of lung cancer . This finding is consistent with experimental data that indicate that IGFBP-3 can inhibit cellular proliferation and induce apoptosis independent of IGF-I and the IGF-I receptor .	sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death
12015983	p53 and INK4a/ARF mutations promote tumorigenesis and drug resistance , in part , by disabling apoptosis . We show that primary murine lymphomas also respond to chemotherapy by engaging a senescence program controlled by p53 and p16(INK4a) . Hence , tumors with p53 or INK4a/ARF mutations-but not those lacking ARF alone-respond poorly to cyclophosphamide therapy in vivo . Moreover , tumors harboring a Bcl2-mediated apoptotic block undergo a drug-induced cytostasis involving the accumulation of p53 , p16(INK4a) , and senescence markers , and typically acquire p53 or INK4a mutations upon progression to a terminal stage . Finally , mice bearing tumors capable of drug-induced senescence have a much better prognosis following chemotherapy than those harboring tumors with senescence defects . Therefore , cellular senescence contributes to treatment outcome in vivo .	enabling replicative immortality;genomic instability and mutation;resisting cell death
12031683	Insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) and IGF-II stimulate cancer cell proliferation via interaction with the type I IGF receptor ( IGF-IR ) . We put forward the hypothesis that IGF-IR mediates cancer cell growth by regulating amino acid transport , both when sufficient nutrients are present and when key nutrients such as glutamine are in limited supply . We examined the effects of alphaIR3 , the monoclonal antibody recognizing IGF-IR , on cell growth and amino acid transport across the cell membrane in a human neuroblastoma cell line , SK-N-SH . In the presence of alphaIR3 ( 2 micro/ml ) , cell proliferation was significantly attenuated in both control ( 2 mM glutamine ) and glutamine-deprived ( 0 mM glutamine ) groups . Glutamine deprivation resulted in significantly increased glutamate ( system X(AG)(-) ) , MeAIB ( system A ) , and leucine ( system L ) transport , which was blocked by alphaIR3 . Glutamine ( system ASC ) and MeAIB transport was significantly decreased by alphaIR3 in the control group . Addition of alphaIR3 significantly decreased DNA and protein biosynthesis in both groups . Glutamine deprivation increased the IGF-IR protein on the cell surface . Our results suggest that activation of IGF-IR promotes neuroblastoma cell proliferation by regulating trans-membrane amino acid transport .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12065682	In vitro model systems for studying uterine leiomyomas are limited in that human-derived leiomyoma cells grow poorly in culture compared with normal myometrial cells and begin to senesce early , at approximately passage 10 in our studies . To our knowledge , a good in vitro human-derived cell culturing system for leiomyomas does not exist . In an attempt to fill this void , we have immortalized a uterine leiomyoma cell line by inducing telomerase activity , which allows cells to bypass their normal programmed senescence . Telomerase activity was induced by infecting the target ( uterine leiomyoma and normal myometrial ) cells with a retroviral vector containing hTERT , the gene for the catalytic subunit of telomerase . Subsequent analysis by RT-PCR and the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay confirmed expression of the inserted gene and induction of telomerase activity in leiomyoma and myometrial cells . Analysis of cells for estrogen receptor-alpha and progesterone receptor proteins by Western blotting showed no change in expression of these proteins between the immortalized and parental leiomyoma and myometrial cells . Both immortalized and parental myometrial and leiomyoma cells expressed the smooth muscle-specific cytoskeletal protein alpha-actin and were negative for mutant p53 protein as evidenced by immunocytochemical staining . The immortalized leiomyoma and myometrial cells showed no anchorage-independent growth , with the exception of a small subpopulation of immortalized leiomyoma cells at a higher passage that did form two to three small colonies ( per 50,000 cells ) in soft agar . None of the immortalized cells were tumorigenic in nude mice . In conclusion , our data show the successful insertion of the hTERT gene into leiomyoma and myometrial cells and the immortalization of these cell lines without phenotypic alteration from the parental cell types ( up to 200 population doublings ) . These cells should help to advance research in understanding the molecular pathways involved in the conversion of a normal myometrial cell to a leiomyoma cell and the mechanisms responsible for the growth of uterine leiomyomas . Answers to these questions will undoubtedly lead to the development of more effective treatment and intervention regimens for clinical cases of uterine leiomyoma .	enabling replicative immortality
12069693	BACKGROUND Modulation of the expression of retinoic acid receptors ( RAR ) alpha and gamma in adult rat prostate by testosterone ( T ) suggests that RAR signaling events might mediate some of the androgen effects on prostate cells . METHOD In this study , we examined the interactions between T and retinoic acid ( RA ) in cell growth of human prostate carcinoma cells , LNCaP , and their relationship with the expression of RAR and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGF-R ) . RESULTS Both T and RA , when administered alone , stimulated 3H-thymidine incorporation in LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner ; the effect of each agent was reciprocally attenuated by the other agent . Testosterone treatment of LNCaP cells also resulted in dose dependent , biphasic increases in RAR alpha and gamma mRNAs ; increases paralleled that of 3H-thymidine incorporation and were attenuated by the presence of 100 nM RA . These results suggest a link between RAR signaling and the effect of T on LNCaP cell growth . Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the presence of putative androgen responsive element ( ARE ) in the promoter region of RAR alpha gene , suggesting that a direct AR-DNA interaction might mediate the effects of T on RAR alpha gene . Furthermore , treatment of LNCaP cells with 20 nM T resulted in an increase in EGF-R . In contrast , EGF-R was suppressed by 100 nM RA that also suppressed the effect of T. CONCLUSIONS Current results demonstrate interactions between T and RA in the expression of RARs and cell growth in LNCaP cells . The presence of putative ARE in the promoter of the RAR alpha gene suggests that AR-DNA interaction might mediate the effects of T on RAR alpha gene . The opposite effects of T and RA on the expression of RAR and EGF-R suggest that signal events of these receptors might be involved in the interaction between T and RA in the control of LNCaP cell growth .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12115477	The metabolic detoxification capacity may critically regulate the susceptibility of human tissues to cancer development . We used standardized and quantitative , reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( StaRT-PCR ) and microarray chip techniques to analyze transcript levels of multiple detoxification enzymes in cultured normal human oral keratinocytes ( NOK ) and the Siman virus 40 T antigen-immortalized oral keratinocyte line SVpgC2a , viewing the latter as a model of a benign tumor state . With good agreement between the 2 methodologies , NOK and SVpgC2a were found to express transcripts for cytochrome P450 enzymes ( CYPs ) , factors related to CYP induction and enzymes involved in conjugation reactions or detoxification of reactive oxygen . The cell types expressed similar levels of CYP 2B6/7 , CYP 2E1 , P450 oxidoreductase , the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator , sulfotransferase 1A1 , sulfotransferase 1A3 , epoxide hydrolase , glutathione S-transferase M3 , glutathione S-transferase pi and catalase , superoxide dismutase 1 , glutathione peroxidase 1 and glutathione peroxidase 3 . In contrast , SVpgC2a exhibited comparatively higher levels of CYP1A1 , 1B1 , aryl hydrocarbon receptor , glutathione S-transferase M1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , glutathione S-transferase theta 1 and superoxide dismutase 2 and comparatively lower levels of UDP glycosyltransferase 2 and microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 . Some transcripts , e.g. , CYP 2A6/7 , were not detected by either standard , non quantitative RT-PCR or the above methods , whereas others were barely quantifiable by StaRT-PCR , i.e. , were present at 1-10 molecules/10(6) molecules of actin . Overall , the expression analysis demonstrated presence of mRNA for multiple enzymes involved in foreign compound metabolism and detoxification pathways , including several enzymes not previously reported for oral epithelium . Generally , the comparison of NOK from 2 individuals indicated relatively similar transcript levels of these enzymes . In contrast , differences between NOK and SVpgC2a , e.g. , for CYP1B1 , may reflect alteration caused by immortalization and aid identification of early stage tumor markers in oral epithelium .	enabling replicative immortality
12161501	We investigated the direct effects of LH-releasing hormone ( LH-RH ) antagonist , Cetrorelix , on the growth of HTOA human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line . RT-PCR revealed the expression of mRNA for LH-RH and its receptor in HTOA cells . Cetrorelix , at concentrations between 10(-9) and 10(-5) M , exerted a dose-dependent antiproliferative action on HTOA cells , as measured by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA . Flow cytometric analysis indicated that Cetrorelix , at 10(-5) M , arrested cell cycle in HTOA cells , at G1 phase , after 24 h of treatment . Western blot analysis of cell cycle-regulatory proteins demonstrated that treatment with Cetrorelix ( 10(-5) M ) for 24 h did not change the steady-state levels of cyclin D1 , cyclin E , and cyclin-dependent kinase ( Cdk)4 but decreased the levels of cyclin A and Cdk2 . The protein levels of p21 ( a Cdk inhibitor ) and p53 ( a suppressor of tumor cell growth and a positive regulator for p21 expression ) were increased by Cetrorelix , but the levels of p27 ( a Cdk inhibitor ) did not change significantly . Flow cytometric analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate nick end labeling staining demonstrated that Cetrorelix ( 10(-5) M ) induced apoptosis in HTOA cells . In conclusion , Cetrorelix directly inhibits the proliferation of human epithelial ovarian cancer cells through mechanisms mediated by LH-RH receptor and involving multiple events in cell cycle progression , including G1 phase cell cycle arrest coupled with down-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 complex levels , presumably attributable to an up-regulation of p53 and p21 protein levels and apoptosis .	sustaining proliferative signaling;evading growth suppressors;resisting cell death
12177246	Id proteins are negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors , which are critical for expression of genes associated with cellular differentiation . Previous studies have shown that overexpression of Id-1 delays cellular senescence in several cell types , including fibroblasts , mammary epithelial cells , and keratinocytes . Although previous studies have demonstrated the expression of Id-1 in endothelium , the regulation of Id-1 has not been studied in these cells . In this report , a retroviral vector was used to overexpress Id-1 in human endothelial cells . Sustained expression of Id-1 resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the total number of population doublings ( replicative capacity ) of the cells compared with vector-treated controls , which correlated with low levels of p16 , p21 , and p27 expression . The cells , however , were not immortalized and did eventually undergo senescence despite elevated Id-1 levels . Senescence was characterized by a dramatic increase in p16 , but not p21 and p27 . Under these experimental conditions , telomerase activity was not detected and the telomeres became progressively shorter with time . These results demonstrate the importance of Id-1 in endothelial cell proliferation and indicate that Id-1 represses p16 expression , resulting in delayed senescence . These findings may have implications in the development of endothelial cell-derived tumors .	enabling replicative immortality
12191570	When cells were incubated in the presence of both interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) and all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , the concentration of IFN-gamma required to induce apoptosis of B-cell lymphoma cells was much lower than that required for myeloid or erythroid cell lines . The concentration of IFN-gamma that effectively inhibited the proliferation of BALM-3 cells was 1/40 of that required for BALM-1 cells . STAT-1 phosphorylation , IRF-1 mRNA and protein expression and RAR-beta expression were enhanced to a greater degree in BALM-3 cells treated with IFN-gamma and ATRA than in BALM-1 cells treated with IFN-gamma and ATRA , suggesting that these IFN-gamma related genes were involved in the induction of apoptosis of BALM-3 cells .	resisting cell death
12219015	BACKGROUND Thrombospondin-1 ( TSP-1 ) promotes breast cancer cell invasion of collagen by upregulating matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) production . Stromal TSP-1 may play a role in regulating tumor cell invasion . We hypothesize that fibroblasts promote breast cancer cell invasion by upregulating the production of MMP-9 through TSP-1 . METHODS MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells were grown alone or in coculture with human fibroblasts . Gelatin zymography and Western immunoblot analysis for MMP-9 were performed on the coculture cell media and the single cell media . Inhibition of fibroblast-mediated breast tumor cell invasion by an anti-TSP-1 or an anti-MMP-9 antibody was evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber . RESULTS Coculture experiments showed an increased production of MMP-9 when compared with breast cancer single cell culture or fibroblast single cell culture experiments as demonstrated by zymography and Western immunoblot analysis . Fibroblast-stimulated MMP-9 production was comparable with TSP-1-stimulated MMP-9 production . Anti-TSP-1 antibody and anti-MMP-9 antibody inhibited fibroblast-stimulated tumor cell invasion to 30% and 26% of controls , respectively ( P &lt;.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS Fibroblasts may regulate breast cancer cell invasion by promoting tumor MMP-9 production through TSP-1 . Inhibition of stromal TSP-1 stimulation of MMP-9 synthesis may prevent matrix degradation necessary for tumor invasion and metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
12227504	A cell line designated HUUCLEC was established from a human uterine cervical lymphoepithelial carcinoma obtained from a 61-year-old Japanese woman . The cell line has grown slowly without interruption and serial passages were successively carried out 60 times within 3 years . The cultured cells were spindle or round in shape , showing anaplastic and pleomorphic features , a pavement cell arrangement and multilayering without contact inhibition . The population doubling time of the HUUCLEC line was 72 hours while the chromosomal number varied widely and showed aneuploidy . The modal chromosomal number was stable at the triploid range and marker chromosomes were present ; the Ebstein-Barr virus was absent in the cultured cells .	evading growth suppressors;genomic instability and mutation
12230501	The ultraviolet radiation present in sunlight is immune suppressive . Recently we showed that solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation ( ultraviolet A + B ; 295-400 nm ) , applied after immunization , suppressed immunologic memory and the elicitation of delayed-type hypersensitivity to the common opportunistic pathogen , Candida albicans . Further , we found that wavelengths in the ultraviolet A region of the solar spectrum ( 320-400 nm ) , devoid of ultraviolet B , were equally effective in activating immune suppression as ultraviolet A + B radiation . Here we report on the mechanisms involved . Maximal immune suppression was found when mice were exposed to solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation 7-9 d post immunization . No immune suppression was found in ultraviolet-irradiated mice injected with monoclonal anti-interleukin-10 antibody , or mice exposed to solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation and injected with recombinant interleukin-12 . Suppressor lymphocytes were found in the spleens of mice exposed to ultraviolet A + B radiation . In addition , antigen-specific suppressor T cells ( CD3+ , CD4+ , DX5+ ) were found in the spleens of mice exposed to ultraviolet A radiation . Applying liposomes containing bacteriophage T4N5 to the skin of mice exposed to solar-simulated ultraviolet A + B radiation , or mice exposed to ultraviolet A radiation , blocked immune suppression , demonstrating an essential role for ultraviolet-induced DNA damage in the suppression of established immune reactions . These findings indicate that overlapping immune suppressive mechanisms are activated by ultraviolet A and ultraviolet A + B radiation . Moreover , our findings demonstrate that ultraviolet radiation activates similar immunologic pathways to suppress the induction of , or the elicitation of , the immune response .	avoiding immune destruction;genomic instability and mutation
12296652	OBJECT The intracellular events transducing mitogenic signals from platelet-derived growth factor-beta ( PDGFbeta ) receptor tyrosine kinases are not precisely known . In this study the authors evaluated whether the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-K)-Akt-p70S6K pathway is expressed in meningiomas , regulates their growth , and transduces mitogenic signals of PDGF-BB . METHODS Nine meningioma tumors obtained in humans were evaluated using Western blot analysis for phosphorylated ( activated ) Akt and phosphorylated p70S6K . Cells cultured from seven of these meningiomas were also screened using Western blot analysis for Akt and for phosphorylated Akt and p70S6K . The authors also evaluated whether PDGF-BB stimulation of meningioma cells was associated with the phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K known to activate these kinases . In addition , the effects of wortmannin , an inhibitor of P13-K , on proliferation and activation of Akt and p70S6K in meningioma cells stimulated with PDGF-BB were evaluated . Western blots of lysates from meningiomas demonstrated phosphorylated Akt and p70S6K . Treatment with PDGF-BB stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K in each meningioma cell culture . Wortmannin ( 500 and 1000 nM ) significantly decreased PDGF-BB stimulation of meningioma cells ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) while it reduced Akt and p70S6K phosphorylation but not mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( MAPK/ERK ) phosphorylation . CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that Akt and p70S6K are constitutively expressed and activated in meningioma cells and that the PI3-K-Akt-p70S6K pathway may participate in transduction of mitogenic signals in meningiomas independent of the Raf-1-MEK-1-MAPK/ERK cascade .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12370807	In human colorectal adenomas or polyps , cyclooxygenase-2 is expressed predominantly by stromal ( or interstitial ) macrophages . Therefore , we tested the hypothesis that macrophage cyclooxygenase-2 has paracrine pro-tumorigenic activity using in vitro models of macrophage-epithelial cell interactions . We report that macrophages can promote tumorigenic progression of intestinal epithelial cells ( evidenced by decreased cell-cell contact inhibition , increased proliferation and apoptosis , gain of anchorage-independent growth capability , decreased membranous E-cadherin expression , up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression , down-regulation of transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor expression and resistance to the anti-proliferative activity of transforming growth factor-beta(1) ) in a paracrine , cyclooxygenase-2-dependent manner . Pharmacologically relevant concentrations ( 1-2 microM ) of a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor had no detectable , direct effect on intestinal epithelial cells but inhibited the macrophage-epithelial cell signal mediating tumorigenic progression . Cyclooxygenase-2-mediated stromal-epithelial cell signalling during the early stages of intestinal tumorigenesis provides a novel target for chemoprevention of colorectal cancer ( and other gastro-intestinal epithelial malignancies , which arise on a background of chronic inflammation , such as gastric cancer ) and may explain the discrepancy between the concentrations of cyclooxygenase inhibitors required to produce anti-neoplastic effects in vitro and in vivo .	evading growth suppressors;resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling;tumor promoting inflammation
12370834	A hallmark of cancer cells is the ability to proliferate indefinitely . This acquisition of an immortal lifespan usually requires the activation of telomerase , the enzyme that elongates telomeres . Human telomerase is minimally composed of the reverse transcriptase subunit hTERT , and the RNA subunit hTR . While hTR is ubiquitously expressed in human cells , the hTERT subunit is generally transcriptionally repressed in most normal somatic cells , but is illegitimately activated to restore telomerase activity in cancer cells . Indeed , in the thousands of different human tumours assayed , 85% were scored positive for telomerase activity . However , the levels of telomerase activity detected in tumour samples can vary substantially and even some normal somatic cells have been found to have low levels of enzyme activity . As the functional significance of low levels of telomerase activity is unclear , we investigated whether there is a minimum level of telomerase activity required for tumourigenesis . Using mutants of hTERT that induce varying levels of telomerase activity , we show that there does indeed exist a threshold of activity required for the processes of immortalization , transformation and tumourigenesis . Thus , low levels of activity detected in certain somatic cells would not be expected to contribute to tumourigenesis , nor does the mere detection of telomerase in cancer cells necessarily signify an immortal lifespan .	enabling replicative immortality
12375734	Environmental carcinogen exposure may play an important role in the incidence of cancer in children . In addition to environmental pollutants , maternal smoking during pregnancy may be a contributing factor . Major carcinogenic components of cigarette smoke and other combustion by-products in the environment include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) . Mouse offspring exposed during midpregnancy to the PAH , benzo[a]pyrene ( B[a]P ) , show significant deficiencies in their immune functions , observed in late gestation which persist for at least 18 months . Tumor incidences in these progeny are 8 to 10-fold higher than in controls . We have demonstrated a significant reduction in thymocytes ( CD4+ CD8+ , CD4+ CD8+ Vbeta8+ , CD4+ CD8+ Vgamma2+ ) from newborn and splenocytes ( CD4+ CD8+ ) from 1-week-old mouse progeny exposed to B[a]P in utero . To investigate possible causes of the observed T cell reduction , we analyzed the thymocytes and splenocytes from progeny and maternal tissues for the presence of B[a]P-DNA adducts . Adducts were detected in maternal , placental and offspring lymphoid tissues at day 19 of gestation , at birth and 1-wk after birth . The presence of B[a]P-DNA adducts in immature T cells may , in part , explain the previously observed T cell immunosuppression and tumor susceptibility in mice exposed to B[a]P in utero . The effects of DNA lesions on progeny T cells may include interference with normal T-cell development . These results provide a possible explanation for the relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood carcinogenesis .	avoiding immune destruction;genomic instability and mutation
12393629	Binding of erythropoietin ( EPO ) to its receptor ( EPOR ) on erythroid cells induces the activation of numerous signal transduction pathways , including the mitogen-activated protein kinase Jun-N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) . In an effort to understand the regulation of EPO-induced proliferation and JNK activation , we have examined the role of potential autocrine factors in the proliferation of the murine erythroleukemia cell line HCD57 . We report here that treatment of these cells with EPO induced the expression and secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) . EPO-dependent proliferation was reduced by the addition of neutralizing antibodies to TNF-alpha , and exogenously added TNF-alpha induced proliferation of HCD57 cells . EPO also could induce TNF-alpha expression in BAF3 and DA3 myeloid cells ectopically expressing EPOR . Addition of TNF-alpha activated JNK in HCD57 cells , and the activity of JNK was partially inhibited by addition of a TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody . Primary human and murine erythroid progenitors expressed TNF-alpha in either an EPO-dependent or constitutive manner . However , TNF-alpha had an inhibitory effect on both immature primary human and murine cells , suggestive that the proliferative effects of TNF-alpha may be limited to erythroleukemic cells . This study suggests a novel role for autocrine TNF-alpha expression in the proliferation of erythroleukemia cells that is distinct from the effect of TNF-alpha in normal erythropoiesis .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12411706	beta-Defensins are small antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system produced in response to microbial infection of mucosal tissue and skin . We demonstrate that murine beta-defensin 2 ( mDF2beta ) acts directly on immature dendritic cells as an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR-4 ) , inducing up-regulation of costimulatory molecules and dendritic cell maturation . These events , in turn , trigger robust , type 1 polarized adaptive immune responses in vivo , suggesting that mDF2beta may play an important role in immunosurveillance against pathogens and , possibly , self antigens or tumor antigens .	avoiding immune destruction
12419447	PURPOSE To investigate treatment of human pancreatic cancer cell lines and xenografts with combinations of Erbitux ( IMC-C225 ) anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) antibody , gemcitabine , and radiation . METHODS AND MATERIALS BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 human pancreatic carcinoma cells were treated in vitro for 24 h with IMC-C225 ( 5 microg/mL ) , then exposed to epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) ( 10 mM ) for 5 min . Immunoblots were screened for EGFR expression and the ability of IMC-C225 to block EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR . Cells were treated with IMC-C225 ( 5 microg/mL ) on Day 0 , the IC(50) dose of gemcitabine on Day 1 for 24 h , followed by 3 Gy 60Co irradiation on Day 2 , or the combination of each agent . For cell proliferation , cells were counted on Day 4 , and for apoptosis , cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide , then analyzed by FACS . Cells were treated with the same single or multiple treatments and analyzed in a clonogenic cell survival assay . The effect of IMC-C225 , gemcitabine , and radiation on the growth of BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 tumor xenografts was determined . Athymic nude mice bearing established s.c. tumor xenografts of 6-8 mm diameter received 6 weeks of treatment with IMC-C225 ( 1 mg every 3 days x 6 ) alone or in combination with gemcitabine ( 120 mg/kg i.v. every 6 days x 6 ) , and 6 weekly fractions of 3 Gy radiation on the days after gemcitabine administration . Tumor growth was measured with Vernier calipers . RESULTS BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 cell lines expressed low levels of EGFR . IMC-C225 inhibited EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor on both cell lines . Treatment of cells with a combination of IMC-C225 + gemcitabine + radiation produced the highest induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation in vitro . Combination treatment with IMC-C225 , gemcitabine , and radiation produced 100% complete regression of MiaPaCa-2 tumors for more than 250 days , and the greatest growth inhibition of BxPC-3 tumors compared to any single or dual treatments . CONCLUSIONS The IMC-C225 therapy in combination with gemcitabine chemotherapy and radiation therapy demonstrated statistically significantly greater efficacy over the single and double combination therapies . This form of multimodality treatment shows potential clinical application in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in humans .	sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death

No immune suppression was found in UV-irradiated mice injected with monoclonal anti-interleukin ( IL)-10 antibody , or mice exposed to solar-simulated UV radiation and injected with recombinant IL-12 . Antigen-specific suppressor T cells were found in the spleens of mice exposed to UVA + UVB radiation . Applying liposomes containing bacteriophage T4N5 to the skin of mice exposed to solar-simulated UVA + UVB radiation or mice exposed to UVA radiation blocked immune suppression , demonstrating an essential role for UV-induced DNA damage in the suppression of established immune reactions . These findings indicate that UV radiation activates similar immunological pathways to suppress the induction , or the elicitation , of the immune response .	avoiding immune destruction;genomic instability and mutation
12446587	Peptide growth factors have been implicated in progression of prostate cancer ( PCa ) to the androgen-independent state ; however , much of the evidence linking diffusible mitogens and survival factors to this process remains circumstantial . Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) , a prostate stroma-derived factor , promotes survival , proliferation , and neuroendocrine differentiation of androgen-dependent LNCaP PCa cells in vitro . To test whether sustained exposure to HB-EGF can confer an androgen-independent phenotype , we generated stable populations of LNCaP cells that express constitutively a secreted form of HB-EGF ( LNCaP/sHB ) . LNCaP/sHB cells proliferated more rapidly under androgen-depleted conditions in vitro and formed larger tumors with higher frequency in intact and castrated severe combined immunodeficient mice , in comparison to control cells . LNCaP/sHB tumors also expressed higher levels of the neuroendocrine marker , neuron-specific enolase , compared with control tumors . In castrates , increased neuron-specific enolase expression in LNCaP/sHB tumors was associated with reduced androgen receptor ( AR ) levels . In vitro , AR protein levels were reduced in LNCaP/sHB cells , and in transient transfection assays using an androgen-responsive promoter ( mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat ) , LNCaP/sHB cells showed reduced sensitivity to dihydrotestosterone compared with controls . This is the first demonstration that continuous exposure of AR-positive PCa cells to a single growth factor can promote an androgen-independent phenotype in vivo . These findings also emphasize the potential role of pathways other than the AR axis in acquisition of androgen independence .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12452772	The influence of radiation-induced apoptosis on radiosensitivity was studied in a set of closely related human lymphoblastoid cell lines differing in TP53 status . The clonogenic survival of irradiated TK6 cells ( expressing wild-type TP53 ) , WTK1 cells ( overexpressing mutant TP53 ) , and TK6E6 cells ( negative for TP53 owing to transfection with HPV16 E6 ) was assessed in relation to the induction of apoptosis and its suppression by caspase inhibition or treatment with PMA as well as after treatment with caffeine . Measurements using the alkaline comet assay and pulsed-field electrophoresis of the induction and repair of DNA strand breaks showed similar kinetics of the processing of early DNA damage in these cell lines . The cytochalasin B micronucleus assay revealed identical levels of residual damage in the first postirradiation mitosis of these cells . Abrogation of TP53-dependent apoptosis in TK6E6 cells resulted in a distinct increase in radioresistance . Further suppression of apoptosis as observed in WTK1 cells overexpressing mutant TP53 apparently was not responsible for the high radioresistance of WTK1 cells , since other means of highly efficient suppression of apoptosis ( caspase inhibition or PMA treatment ) increased the clonogenic survival of irradiated TK6 cells only to levels similar to those of TK6E6 cells with abrogated TP53-dependent apoptosis . Considering the similar levels of residual chromosomal damage in TK6E6 cells and WTK1 cells , a hitherto unknown mechanism of tolerance needs to be inferred for these TP53 mutant cells . This residual damage tolerance , however , appears to require an intact G2/M-phase checkpoint function since the relative radioresistance of the WTK1 cells was completely lost upon caffeine treatment , which also resulted in a failure of the TK6 and TK6E6 cells to execute apoptosis . In this situation , the cellular response seems to be dominated entirely by TP53-independent mitotic failure .	genomic instability and mutation;resisting cell death
12458342	PURPOSE The roles of terminal sialyl and fucosyl residues in cell surface glycans in the metastatic potential of H7721 cells , a human hepatocarcinoma cell line , were studied . METHODS Neuraminidase and alpha-L-fucosidase were used to remove the sialyl and fucosyl residues , respectively . Cell adhesion to fibronectin ( Fn ) , laminin ( Ln ) , and human umbilical vein epithelial cell ( HUVEC ) , as well as chemotactic cell migration and invasion , were selected as the parameters of metastatic potential ex vivo . RESULTS Sialyl residue is not essential for cell adhesion to Fn , but is important in cell adhesion to Ln and invasion , and is crucial in cell adhesion to HUVEC and migration . In contrast , fucosyl residue contributes more than sialyl residue to cell adhesion to Fn and Ln , but less to adhesion to HUVEC , and is not essential in chemotactic cell migration and invasion . Cell adhesion to HUVEC , migration , and invasion were inhibited by the monoclonal antibody of sialyl Lewis X , but not by the antibody of non-sialyl Lewis X. CONCLUSION Terminal sialyl residues on cell surface glycans are more important than fucosyl residues in mediating cell adhesion to HUVEC and cell migration/invasion , but the reverse is true in cell adhesion to Fn and Ln .	activating invasion and metastasis
12463595	The capacity to repair DNA damage is an important factor that affects the therapeutic outcome in cancer treatment . To clarify the cellular repair response , we investigated the kinetics of DNA excision repair initiated by 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea ( BCNU ) in human leukemia CCRF-CEM cells at an exponential growth phase in vitro . Using the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis ( comet ) assay , we quantitated the repair kinetics as the amount of DNA single-strand breaks that were generated from the incision and were diminished by the rejoining in the repair process . CEM cells could initiate DNA excision repair in response to BCNU by starting an incision reaction . However , the incision capacity came to a plateau at a concentration of 80 to 100 microM or after an incubation time of 90 to 120 minutes . When the cells were pulsed with 40 microM BCNU , the maximal incision occurred at the end of the incubation period , and the repair process was completed within 4 hours When cells were treated with 100 microM BCNU , the incised DNA was not rejoined at 4 hours , suggesting that the repair was not completed . Higher concentrations might surpass the cellular capacity for repair and would be associated with increased cell death . Evaluation of the repair process may provide a clue for therapeutic strategies to improve clinical efficacy if accelerated DNA repair is responsible for the drug resistance .	genomic instability and mutation;resisting cell death
12474059	Transfected linear DNA molecules are substrates for double-strand break ( DSB ) repair in mammalian cells . The DSB repair process can involve recombination between the transfected DNA molecules , between the transfected molecules and chromosomal DNA , or both . In order to determine whether these different types of repair events are linked , we devised assays enabling us to follow the fate of linear extrachromosomal DNA molecules involved in both interplasmid and chromosome-plasmid recombination , in the presence or absence of a pre-defined chromosomal DSB . Plasmid-based vectors were designed that could either recombine via interplasmid recombination or chromosome-plasmid recombination to produce a functional beta-galactosidase ( betagal ) fusion gene . By measuring the frequency of betagal+ cells at 36 h post-transfection versus the frequency of betagal+ clones after 14 days , we found that the number of cells containing extrachromosomal recombinant DNA molecules at 36 h ( i.e. , betagal+ ) , either through interplasmid or chromosome-plasmid recombination , was nearly the same as the number of cells integrating these recombinant molecules . Furthermore , when a predefined DSB was created at a chromosomal site , the extrachromosomal recombinant DNA molecules were shown to integrate preferentially at that site by Southern and fiber-FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) analysis . Together these data indicate that the initial recombination event can potentiate or commit extrachromosomal DNA to integration in the genome at the site of a chromosomal DSB . The efficiency at which extrachromosomal recombinant molecules are used as substrates in chromosomal DSB repair suggests extrachromosomal DSB repair can be coupled to the repair of chromosomal DSBs in mammalian cells .	genomic instability and mutation
12479268	Tumor metastasis represents a complex multistep process that requires migration , invasion , and angiogenesis . In this study , we examined the impact of molecular blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor on the invasive and metastatic capacity of human squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the head and neck using in vitro and in vivo model systems . Treatment with the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody C225 attenuated the migration of SCC-1 tumor cells through a chemotaxis chamber in a dose-dependent manner . Incubation of SCC cells with 10-100 nM C225 for 4 h resulted in 40-60% inhibition of cell migration . Furthermore , in the presence of C225 , the capacity of SCC-1 to invade across a layer of extracellular matrix ( Matrigel ) was significantly inhibited . Using an in vivo orthotopic floor-of-mouth xenograft model , locoregional tumor invasion of SCC-1 into muscle , vessel , bone , and perineural tissues was inhibited in C225-treated mice . This inhibition was additionally characterized by down-regulation in the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 . These data suggest that inhibition of metastatic potential by C225 may be mediated via decreased migration and invasion of SCC cells . Regarding angiogenesis in vitro , we first studied human umbilical vascular endothelial cells , which established a capillary-like network structure ( tube formation ) in the presence of reconstituted Matrigel . Treatment with C225 reduced cell-to-cell interaction of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells , resulting in disruption of tube formation . The effect of C225 was additionally examined using an in vivo tumor xenograft neovascularization model of angiogenesis . Systemic treatment with C225 not only reduced tumor growth and the number of blood capillaries but also hindered the growth of established vessels toward the tumor . Taken together , these results provide evidence that C225 can suppress tumor-induced neovascularization and metastasis in SCC of the head and neck .	activating invasion and metastasis;inducing angiogenesis
12482245	Although there have been numerous studies of site-specific mutagenesis by dGuo adducts of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxides ( B[a]P DEs ) , the present study represents the first example of site-specific mutagenesis by dGuo adducts of the highly carcinogenic benzo[c]phenanthrene 3,4-diol 1,2-epoxides ( B[c]Ph DEs ) . The eight adducts that would result from cis- and trans-opening at C-1 of four optically active isomers of B[c]Ph DEs by the N(2)-amino group of dGuo were incorporated into 5'-TTCGAATCCTTCCCCC ( context III ) and 5'-GGGGTTCCCGAGCGGC ( context IV ) at the underlined site . These modified oligonucleotides along with unmodified controls were ligated into single-stranded M13mp7L2 , which were then used to transfect SOS-induced Escherichia coli . Upon replication of the lesions in each of the two sequence contexts , mutational analysis of the progeny was performed by differential hybridization . For the 16 adducts , the mutation frequencies varied over 2 orders of magnitude with a reasonably even distribution ( 0.4-1% for three adducts , 1-2% for six adducts , 3-7.4% for five adducts , and one adduct each at 11 and 39% ) . For all but this last adduct , the mutation frequency for a given B[c]Ph DE adduct was less than for its B[a]P analogue with the same stereochemistry in the same sequence . For the vectors containing adducts with S configuration at the site of attachment of the hydrocarbon to the dGuo base , the main base substitution was G --&gt ; T followed by G --&gt ; A. In contrast , for the vectors containing adducts with R configuration , the main base substitution was G --&gt ; A. The most notable observation in the present study is the low frequency of mutations induced by the B[c]Ph DE-dGuo adducts relative to their B[a]P counterparts . A possible structural basis for this difference is proposed .	genomic instability and mutation
12486230	The Escherichia coli AlkB protein protects against the cytotoxicity of methylating agents by repair of the DNA lesions 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine , which are generated in single-stranded stretches of DNA . AlkB is an alpha-ketoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase that oxidizes the relevant methyl groups and releases them as formaldehyde . Here , we identify two human AlkB homologs , ABH2 and ABH3 , by sequence and fold similarity , functional assays , and complementation of the E. coli alkB mutant phenotype . The levels of their mRNAs do not appear to correlate with cell proliferation but tissue distributions are different . Both enzymes remove 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine from methylated polynucleotides in an alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent reaction , and act by direct damage reversal with the regeneration of the unsubstituted bases . AlkB , ABH2 , and ABH3 can also repair 1-ethyladenine residues in DNA with the release of acetaldehyde .	genomic instability and mutation
12489114	The Msh2 DNA mismatch repair gene is one of five genes implicated in the pathogenesis of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) . To address the possible mechanisms of the site-specific occurrence of HNPCC , the effect of Msh2 deficiency on mutations in different parts of the colon was investigated using the BC-1(lacI)/Msh2 double transgenic mouse . Compared to the Msh2(+/+) mice , Msh2(-/-) mice had an 8-9-fold increase of mutation frequency ( MF ) in the lacI gene from the cecum and the proximal and distal colon . The mutational spectra were also significantly different between Msh2(+/+) and Msh2(-/-) mice , with a significant increase in the frequency of -1 frameshifts and G:C--&gt;A:T base substitutions in the repair-deficient mice . However , in spite of the site-specific predisposition of HNPCC in humans , we found no significant difference in the MF or mutation spectrum between the three parts of the colon in Msh2(+/+) , Msh2(+/-) , or Msh2(-/-) mice . In addition , 11 independent mutants harboring complex mutations within the lacI gene were recovered in the Msh2(-/-) mice . Interestingly , while the Msh2(+/-) mice displayed an overall MF similar to that observed in the wild-type mice , sequencing revealed a significantly different mutational spectrum between Msh2(+/+) and Msh2(+/-) mice , mainly characterized by an increase in -1 frameshifts . Due to the prevalence of frameshift mutations in HNPCC patients , this haploinsufficiency effect of the Msh2 gene in safeguarding genomic integrity may have important implications for human carrier status .	genomic instability and mutation
12494889	A6 is an eight amino acid peptide derived from the non-receptor binding region of urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) , which interferes with the uPA/uPA receptor system . A6 has been synthesized as a potential anti-angiogenic , anti-cancer agent . The current study has investigated the potential therapeutic activity of A6 in the Lewis lung carcinoma ( 3LL ) model of pulmonary metastasis . A6 was found to have direct anti-tumor activity against established 3LL pulmonary metastases at a low tumor burden ( 10-20 colonies per lung ) and was therapeutic in combination with cyclophosphamide at high tumor burdens ( &gt ; 100 colonies per lung ) . Mechanistic studies have revealed that A6 directly inhibits the invasion of 3LL cells through a Matrigel model basement membrane by 40-45% . Moreover , treatment with either A6 or doxorubicin resulted in thicker tubes in endothelial tube formation studies . Our results suggest that A6 , by virtue of its anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic properties , might work additively or synergistically with chemotherapeutic agents and thereby contribute to enhanced therapy of established 3LL cancer metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis;inducing angiogenesis
12494891	Tumor-associated macrophages ( TAM ) have been shown to play an important role in tumor angiogenesis . The purpose of this study was to determine whether monocyte recruitment , activation and differentiation mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) and macrophage colony stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) modulate the expression of the angiogenic factor , Interleukin ( IL)-8 . Isolated human peripheral blood monocytes secreted low basal levels of IL-8 . Incubation of monocytes with M-CSF or MCP-1 resulted in an up-regulation of IL-8 mRNA and protein expression . The differential expression of IL-8 by monocytes following MCP-1 and M-CSF treatments involved activation of the NFkB transcription factor . Further activation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) caused an increase in IL-8 secretion in monocytes but not in monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ) . MDM-conditioned media significantly up-regulated IL-8 expression in human malignant melanoma cells in vitro . In summary , we demonstrated that MCP-1 and M-CSF , critical for monocyte recruitment , activation and differentiation , differentially regulate IL-8 expression and may play an important role in monocyte/macrophage-mediated tumor angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
12495475	Recent studies have shown that the antiestrogen tamoxifen ( TAM ) can be used in the treatment of malignant neoplasms other than breast cancer . In the present study , we investigated the expression of estrogen receptor ( ER ) in six malignant rhabdoid tumor ( MRT ) cell lines . Alterations in MRT cell growth in response to estrogen or antiestrogens ( 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( 4-OHT ) , TAM , and ICI 182 780 ) were also investigated . RT-PCR and western blotting showed that ER-alpha was expressed in three of the six MRT cell lines . While 17-beta-estradiol ( E2 ) did not significantly alter MRT cell line proliferation , the hydroxylated tamoxifen metabolite 4-OHT significantly inhibited the growth of all 6 MRT cell lines . However , the steroidal antiestrogen ICI 182 780 did not alter the proliferation of any of the MRT cell lines. 4-OHT induced apoptosis in both ER-alpha-negative and ER-alpha-positive MRT cell lines , as assessed by nuclear morphology and DNA fragmentation . Neither growth inhibition nor induction of apoptosis due to 4-OHT was blocked by the addition of excess E2 . Our data suggested that 4-OHT induced cytotoxic effects against MRT cells , and that these effects were independent of ER expression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12505306	The thyroid hormone ( T3 ) blocks proliferation and induces differentiation of neuroblastoma N2a-beta cells that overexpress the beta 1 isoform of the T3 receptor . An element in the region responsible for premature termination of transcription mediates a rapid repression of c-myc gene expression by T3 . The hormone also causes a decrease of cyclin D1 gene transcription , and is able to antagonize the activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by Ras . In addition , a strong and sustained increase of the levels of the cyclin kinase inhibitor ( CKI ) p27(Kip1) are found in T3-treated cells . The increased levels of p27(Kip1) lead to a marked inhibition of the kinase activity of the cyclin-CDK2 complexes . As a consequence of these changes , retinoblastoma proteins are hypophosphorylated in T3-treated N2a-beta cells , and progression through the restriction point in the cell cycle is blocked .	sustaining proliferative signaling;evading growth suppressors
12506039	Little is known about the requirements for human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) entry , including the identity of the cellular receptor(s) . Recently , we have generated an HTLV-I surface glycoprotein ( SU ) immunoadhesin , HTSU-IgG , which binds specifically to cell-surface protein(s) critical for HTLV-I-mediated entry in cell lines . Here , expression of the HTLV-I SU binding protein on primary cells of the immune system was examined . The immunoadhesin specifically bound to adult T cells , B cells , NK cells , and macrophages . Cell stimulation dramatically increased the amount of binding , with the highest levels of binding on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells . Naive ( CD45RA(high) , CD62L(high) ) CD4(+) T cells derived from cord blood cells , in contrast to other primary cells and all cell lines examined , bound no detectable HTLV-I SU . However , following stimulation , the level of HTSU-IgG binding was rapidly induced ( fewer than 6 hours ) , reaching the level of binding seen on adult CD4(+) T cells by 72 hours . In contrast to HTLV-I virions , the soluble HTSU-IgG did not effect T-cell activation or proliferation . When incubated with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a mixed leukocyte reaction , HTSU-IgG inhibited proliferation at less than 1 ng/mL . These results indicate that cell-surface expression of the HTLV SU binding protein is up-regulated during in vitro activation and suggest a role for the HTLV-I SU binding proteins in the immunobiology of CD4(+) T cells .	avoiding immune destruction
12508543	BACKGROUND &amp ; OBJECTIVE There is little ideal predictor available on evaluating the lymph node metastatic potential of breast carcinoma . This study was designed to determine the expression of gene products of E-cadherin ( epithelial ) , N-cadherin ( nerve ) , and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) in breast carcinoma tissue and investigate their association with the invasion and metastasis of breast carcinoma . METHODS The authors examined the expressions of E-cadherin , N-cadherin , and MMP-9 in 72 cases of breast carcinoma(39 cases with lymph node metastasis and 33 cases without lymph node metastasis ) by immunohistochemistry . Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the patients ' prognosis . RESULTS The average ranks of E-cadherin in lymph node metastasis group and no lymph node metastasis group were 29.19 and 45.14 , respectively , with significant difference ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) . The expression of E-cadherin was correlated inversely with the metastasis of breast carcinoma . The average ranks of N-cadherin and MMP-9 were 40.04 and 42.97 in lymph node metastasis group , and 32.32 and 28.85 in no lymph node metastasis group , both with significant difference ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) , and these expressions were positively correlated with the lymph node metastasis of breast carcinoma . The patients who had high expression of E-cadherin had a longer survival time . CONCLUSION Expression of E-cadherin , N-cadherin , and MMP-9 are associated strongly with lymph node metastasis of breast carcinoma . These proteins are indicators of metastasis potential and prognosis of breast carcinoma .	activating invasion and metastasis
12508658	BACKGROUND &amp ; OBJECTIVE Usually pituitary adenomas are histological benign and grow slowly , but a proportion of them will become locally aggressive , and develop into invasive pituitary adenomas . The reasons for these differences in tumor behavior are poorly understood . Pituitary adenomas are abounding blood vessels . Angiogenesis and tumor invasion both require degradation of the extracellular matrix components to allow cell migration . The matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) may play a central role in these processes . The aggressive mechanism of pituitary adenomas was studied through investigating the expression of MMP-9 , MMP-2 , TIMP-1 , and TIMP-2 in both invasive and non-invasive adenomas . METHODS Sixty-one surgical removed pituitary adenomas ( forty-nine cases invasive and twelve non-invasive adenomas ) were investigated . Immunohistochemistry staining ( SP method ) was used to detect the expression of MMP-9 , MMP-2 , TIMP-1 , and TIMP-2 in two groups . The results were treated with semi-quantitative method and analyzed by using non-parameter rank sum test . RESULTS Immunohistochemical staining of tumor cells for MMP-9 , TIMP-1 , MMP-2 , and TIMP-2 were noted 95.9% ( 47/49 ) , 57.1% ( 28/49 ) , 75.5% ( 37/49 ) and 89.8% ( 44/49 ) in invasive adenomas , and 100% ( 12/12 ) , 91.7% ( 11/12 ) , 66.7% ( 8/12 ) , and 91.7% ( 11/12 ) in non-invasive adenomas , respectively . Invasive tumors were significantly less expressing TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) . There was no significant difference for MMP-9 or MMP-2 between invasive and non-invasive groups ( P &gt ; 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 may play a key role in invasive pituitary adenomas to biological behavior .	activating invasion and metastasis
12509275	This study was set up to investigate the relationships between the formation and removal of DNA damage in form of 8-oxodeoxyguanosine ( 8-oxodG ) in neonatal ( day 16 of gestation ) as compared to adult rats . The hypothesis addressed was whether the rapidly dividing foetal tissue has an enhanced requirement of DNA repair providing protection against potentially mutagenic DNA damages such as 8-oxodG . The activity of the primary 8-oxodG-repair protein OGG1 was measured by a DNA incision assay and the expression of OGG1 mRNA was measured by Real-Time PCR normalised to 18S rRNA . The tissue level of 8-oxodG was measured by HPLC-ECD . We found a 2-3-fold increased incision activity in the foetal control tissue , together with a 3-15-fold increase in mRNA of OGG1 as compared to liver tissue from adult rats . The levels of 8-oxodG in the foetal tissue were unaltered as compared to the adult groups . To increase the levels of 8-oxodG , the rats received an injection ( i.p. ) of the hepatotoxin 2-nitropropane . The compound induced significant levels of 8-oxodG in male rat livers 5h after the injection and in the foetuses 24h after the injection , while the female rats showed no increase in 8-oxodG . The incision activity was slightly depressed in both male and female liver tissue and in the foetal tissue 5h after the injection , but significantly increased from 5 to 24h after the injection . However , it did not reach levels significantly above the control levels . In conclusion , this study confirms that foetal tissue has increased levels of OGG1 mRNA and correspondingly an enhanced incision activity on an 8-oxodG substrate in a crude tissue extract .	genomic instability and mutation;tumor promoting inflammation
12511053	Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) may trigger apoptosis or necrosis in cancer cells . Several steps in the induction and execution of apoptosis require high amounts of adenosine-5'-triphosphate ( ATP ) . Because the mitochondrial membrane potential ( delta psi ) decreases early in apoptosis , we raised the question about the mechanisms of maintaining a sufficiently high ATP level . We therefore monitored delta psi and the intracellular ATP level of apoptotic human epidermoid carcinoma cells ( A431 ) after photodynamic treatment with aluminum ( III ) phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate . A maximum of caspase-3-like activity and nuclear fragmentation was found at fluences of about 4 J cm(-2) . Under these conditions apoptotic cells reduced delta psi rapidly , while the ATP level remained high for 4-6 h after treatment for cells supplied with glucose . To analyze the contribution of glycolysis to the energy supply during apoptosis , experiments were carried out with cells deprived of glucose . These cells showed a rapid drop of ATP content and neither caspase activation nor nuclear fragmentation could be detected . We conclude that the use of glucose as a source of ATP is obligatory for the execution of PDT-induced apoptosis .	resisting cell death;cellular energetics
12516957	Recent studies have shown that the transcription factor , nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , regulates critical survival pathways in a variety of different cell types , including human pancreatic cancer cells . The activation of NF-kappaB is controlled by proteasome-mediated degradation of its endogenous polypeptide inhibitor , inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaBalpha . We investigated the effects of PS-341 , a peptide boronate inhibitor of the proteasome in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo . Comparison of PS-341's effects on the growth of eight different human pancreatic cancer cell lines revealed marked heterogeneity in drug responsiveness , ranging from highly resistant ( IC50 &gt ; 10 microM ; Panc-48 , HS766T , and Mia-PaCa-2 ) to extremely sensitive ( IC50 &lt ; 40 nM ; L3.6pl , Hpaf2 , and BxPC3 ) . However , these effects did not correlate with differential inhibition of NF-kappaB activation . Direct quantification of apoptosis revealed that PS-341's effects on cell growth largely correlated with sensitivity to programmed cell death . Evaluation of PS-341's effects on established orthotopic tumor xenografts demonstrated that biweekly intravenous administration of the maximum-tolerated dose of the drug ( 1 mg/kg ) led to significant reductions in the volumes of L3.6pl tumors but not Mia-PaCa-2 tumors . Laser scanning cytometer-mediated quantification of drug-induced apoptosis in the xenografts confirmed that PS-341 induced DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3 in L3.6pl tumors but not in Mia-PaCa-2 tumors . However , histological examination of drug-treated tumors revealed extensive central necrosis and reductions in microvessel density and VEGF expression in both tumor types . Taken together , our results demonstrate that PS-341 inhibits the growth of human pancreatic tumors via direct effects on tumor cells and indirect effects on the tumor vasculature .	resisting cell death;inducing angiogenesis
12529992	Like all cancers , breast cancer is considered to result in part from the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations leading to oncogene overexpression and tumor suppressor loss . More recently , CpG island hypermethylation is known to be associated with gene silencing in cancer , and these silenced genes can be reactivated by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5-Aza-CdR ) . Retionoic acid receptor beta 2 gene is a tumor suppressor gene and the chemopreventive effects of retinoids are due to induction of RAR beta 2 . In this study , the effect of 5-Aza-CdR RAR beta 2 restoration was investigated in the MRK-nu-1 human female breast cancer cell line . Changes of the RAR beta 2 methylation status were assessed by methylation-specific PCR . Reverse transcription PCR was used to evaluate RARb beta 2 restoration . Cell cycling and growth inhibition were studied using flow cytometric analysis of DNA content and CellTiter 96 AQueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay , respectively. 5-Aza-CdR treatment resulted in complete demethylation of the RAR beta 2 gene . RAR beta 2 restoration was accompanied by cell cycle arrest ( increase in the G0/G1- and decrease in the S- and G2/M-phases ) and time-dependent growth inhibition . In conclusion , RAR beta 2 can be activated in vitro by 5-Aza-CdR , which may be one of the mechanisms for the tumor cell growth inhibition by 5-Aza-CdR .	evading growth suppressors
12530060	We have recently identified ICBP90 as being a protein able to bind in vitro a CCAAT box of the topoisomerase II alpha gene promoter . The aim of the present work was to check whether ICBP90 is able to regulate in vivo topoisomerase II alpha expression in human lung fibroblasts under various proliferating conditions . Transient transfection experiments performed on moderately growing human lung fibroblasts ( 50% of confluence ) showed that overexpression of ICBP90 is associated with an elevation of topoisomerase II alpha expression and an increase of the cell proliferation rate . In highly proliferating human lung fibroblasts ( 20% confluence ) overexpression of ICBP90 had no effect . In contrast , in non-proliferating fibroblasts ( 100% confluence ) overexpression of ICBP90 allowed recovery of topoisomerase II alpha expression levels with a concomitant overgrowth of confluent cell cultures . Our results show that ICBP90 regulates topoisomerase II alpha expression and is able to overcome cell contact inhibition signaling , suggesting that increased ICBP90 expression may be involved in carcinogenesis .	evading growth suppressors
12531021	We have made xeroderma pigmentosum group A gene ( XPA)-knockout mice ( XPA(-/-) mice ) . The XPA(-/-) mice had no detectable activity for nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and showed a high incidence of UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis . We have also found that cell lines derived from skin cancers in UVB-irradiated XPA(-/-) mice become tolerant to UV-irradiation and showed abnormal UV-induced cell cycle checkpoints and decreased mismatch repair ( MMR ) activity . These results suggested that the MMR-downregulation may help cells escape killing by UV-irradiation and thus MMR-deficient clones are selected for during the tumorigenic transformation of XPA(-/-) cells . In this report , we examined whether the incidence of UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis is enhanced in XPA(-/-)MSH2(-/-) , XPA(-/-) and MSH2(-/-) mice when compared with that in wild-type mice . Our results indicate that the MSH2-deficiency caused a high incidence of spontaneous and UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis and the XPA and MSH2 genes have additive roles in the UV-induced skin tumorigenesis .	genomic instability and mutation;evading growth suppressors
12536240	Natural killer ( NK ) and CD56(+) T cells are thought to play a central role in antitumour immunity . Their cytolytic activities are controlled by a variety of receptors including CD94 and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors ( KIR ) , which bind to major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecules on target cells and mediate cell activation or inhibition . We have examined the numbers , phenotypes and antitumour cytotoxic functions of hepatic NK and CD56(+) T cells isolated from 22 patients with hepatic malignancy and 19 healthy donors . Flow cytometry revealed that NK cell numbers were increased among hepatic mononuclear cells in malignancy compared to histologically normal livers ( mean : 38% vs 27% ; P=0.03 ) , but CD56(+) T cell numbers were not ( 28% vs 27% ) . NK cells and CD56(+) T cells from tumour-bearing livers exhibited lymphokine-activated killing of K562 targets and T cell receptor-mediated lysis of P815 cells . The expression of CD94 and the KIR isotypes CD158a , CD158b and KIR3DL1 by CD56(+) T cells and NK cells was significantly and consistently reduced in tumour-bearing livers compared to healthy livers ( P&lt;0.05 in all cases ) . Simultaneous ligation of CD158a , CD158b and KIR3DL1 caused an overall partial inhibition of CD56(+) T cell cytotoxic activity , suggesting that the observed reductions in KIR(+) cell numbers in malignancy are likely to lead to enhanced cytotoxicity . Our results suggest that , while hepatic CD56(+) T cells are not expanded in malignancy , downregulation of KIR and CD94 expression may be a mechanism by which the hepatic immune system can be activated to facilitate tumour rejection .	avoiding immune destruction
12553062	We examined the inducibility of drug resistance ( MDR1 , MRP1 , LRP ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) isozyme ( alpha , epsilon , eta , theta , tau , zeta ) corresponding genes in A2780 ovarian cancer cells after a 24-hour treatment with adriamycin ( ADR ) , camptothecin ( CAM ) , etoposide ( ETO ) or vincristine ( VCR ) . Sublethal concentrations of drugs were used to exclude short-term effects caused by selection . Cell cycle analysis was performed to identify possible correlation between resistance factors , PKC isozymes and proliferation . We found a mostly combined induction of MDR1 , LRP , PKC tau and PKC zeta by CAM , ETO and VCR . PKC alpha , epsilon , eta and theta gene expression altered variably . Cell cycle analysis showed that A2780 cells responded with a marked G2/M arrest after a 24-hour treatment with CAM , ETO and VCR but an association between the induction of PKC isozymes corresponding genes and proliferation was not seen . Our analysis points to a possible link between atypical PKC tau/PKC zeta and MDR1/LRP in cytostatic stress response of cancer cells .	evading growth suppressors
12553372	Recent reports provide evidence that some growth factors behave as inhibitors of the apoptosis of the endothelial cells , bringing forward the concept of vascular survival as a post-angiogenesis process . At least two different vasculature development processes occur within a tumor : the angiogenic ( formation of new vessels ) and the vascular survival pathway , which is devoted to the preservation of the newly-formed vessels in layers that lose contact with the adjacent normal tissue . We developed a method to assess these processes in tissue samples . We noted that differences among tumors may exist not only in the tumor angiogenic activity ( TAA ) but also in the vascular survival ability ( VSA ) . One third of the highly angiogenic breast cancer cases examined had a poor ability to maintain high vessel density in inner tumor areas . Both parameters are independently related to prognosis , while VSA was directly related to tumor dimensions and node involvement . Patients with high TAA and VSA had a particularly poor prognosis . It is suggested that although cancer angiogenic activity is important for the local invasion and dissemination into vessels and lymphatics , the VSA may be important for the effective formation of viable tumor foci in lymph nodes or distant organs . Recognition and quantification of the vascular survival ability in human tumors may significantly improve the prognostic value of the assessment of tumor vasculature , and may help to stratify patients for clinical trials with novel anti-angiogenic or angiotoxic drugs . Elucidation of the pathways may provide additional targets for antiangiogenic therapy .	inducing angiogenesis;activating invasion and metastasis
12577239	The effects of dose per fraction on the ability of amifostine exposure to elevate angiostatin levels in the serum of mice and to inhibit spontaneous metastases formation using the well-characterized murine Sa-NH sarcoma were investigated . Amifostine was administered intraperitoneally at doses of 50 , 100 , or 200 mg/kg every other day for 6 days to C3Hf/Kam mice until tumors reached an average size of 8 mm in diameter . Amifostine was again administered immediately following surgical removal of the tumor-bearing limbs by amputation , and then once more 2 days later . Nontumor-bearing control animals were treated using the same dosing and surgery schedules . The average number of pulmonary metastases per animal was determined for each experimental group . A significant reduction ( P &lt;.05 ) in the average number of pulmonary metastases was observed only in the group of animals exposed to a dose per fraction of 50 mg/kg . A dose of 100 mg/kg was less effective while 200 mg/kg had no effect on metastases formation in this study . The effects of amifostine exposure on serum levels of the angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin were also determined using Western analysis . Correlating with the antimetastatic effect measured , exposure of animals to 50 mg/kg of amifostine resulted in a four-fold enhanced serum level of angiostatin above control levels . This phenomenon occurred in both tumor-bearing as well as nontumor-bearing animals . In contrast , a dose of 200-mg/kg amifostine administered intraperitoneally under these conditions had no measurable effect on angiostatin serum levels in this animal system . The enhanced ability of relatively low doses of amifostine to inhibit spontaneous metastases formation suggests that effective antimetastatic therapies with amifostine can be designed with minimal toxic side effects . While the dose responses for angiostatin production and metastases inhibition by amifostine are well correlated , the precise mechanism of action underlying these phenomena is unclear but is suggestive of a redox driven process(es) .	activating invasion and metastasis
12579898	AIM To develop a simple , fast and inexpensive approach as well as an instrument for detection of gene mutation . METHODS Pyrosequencing based on bioluminometry assay was employed to detect gene mutation . Pyrosequencing is a method of sequencing by synthesis step-by-step using four enzymes , DNA-polymerase , ATP sulfurylase , luciferase and apyrase . The signal was produced by detecting pyrophosphate released during a dNTP incorporation . For mutation detection , a DNA fragment was amplified by PCR at first , followed by a single-stranded DNA preparation . In the second step , a short primer was annealed to the position just before the mutation point . Finally , specific dNTPs were added in terms of the template sequence . The mutation species can be readily determined by the sequence . RESULTS A new instrument was developed for gene mutation detection by pyrosequencing . To iteratively inject small amount of each dNTP for the sequencing reaction , capillaries were used to connect dNTP reservoirs and the reaction chamber . Each dNTP was delivered by adding a gas pressure on the top of a corresponding dNTP reservoir , by which 0.2 microL of dNTP can be exactly added each time . It was theoretically proved that undesired liquid seep through the capillary did not affect the sequencing reactions in pyrosequencing . In addition , the three possible variants ( wildtype , mutant and heterozygote ) of a mutant point Cys275Ser in P53 gene exon 8 were determined by pyrosequencing using the instrument . A simple method was also described for rapidly distinguishing the type of a variant . CONCLUSION The developed method is very simple , and the corresponding instrument is inexpensive and easy to operate , which can be used to detect many types of mutation .	genomic instability and mutation
12599421	OBJECTIVE To investigate the expression and mutation of MTA1 , nm23H1 and E-cadherin(E-cad) genes in ovarian carcinoma ( OC ) in relation to lymph node ( LN ) metastasis . METHODS A panel of normal ovarian tissues , primary OC specimens and corresponding LNS was examined for mRNA expression and mutation of MTA1 and nm23H1 and protin expression of E-cad genes by using RT-PCR , RT-PCR-SSCP and immunohistochemistry . RESULTS The frequency of MTA1 over expression was 100%(7/7) in primary OC with metastasis but only 38.5%(5/13) in those without metastasis ( P = 0.0103 ) . Overexpression of MTA1 was observed in 87.5%(6/7) of LNS with metastasis but in only 23%(3/13) of LNS without metastasis ( P = 0.0118 ) . In contrast with MTA1 , low expression of nm23H1 mRNA was seen in 7 of 7 OC with metastasis but only in 4 of 13(30%) of those without metastasis ( P = 0.0043 ) . Low nm23H1 expression was also seen in 7 of 7 LNS with metastasis but only in 5 of 13 ( 38.5% ) nonmetastatic LNS ( P = 0.0102 ) . Meantime , no expression of E-cad protein was observed in 7 of 7 OC with metastasis but in 6 of 13(46.2%) of those without metastasis ( P = 0.044 ) . In correlation analysis of the three genes , MTA1 reversely correlated with nm23H1 and E-cad respectively ( r = -0.903 , -0.803 ) , and positive correlation existed between nm23H1 and E-cad ( r = 0.724 ) . No mutation of MTA1 , nm23H1 and was found by SSCP analysis . CONCLUSION The mRNA expression of MTA1 , nm23H1 and E-cad is positively and negatively correlated with LN metastasis . The expression abnormalities but not the mutations of the three genes are frequent events related to LN metastasis of ovarian cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis;genomic instability and mutation
12622418	ZBP-89 ( ZNF148 ) is a Zinc finger Binding Protein of 89 kDa that binds GC-rich DNA elements . Originally , it was expression cloned using a DNA element mediating EGF regulation of the gastrin promoter . ZBP-89 functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor . A variety of extracellular regulators including TGFbeta , retinoic acid and butyrate stimulate ZBP-89 gene expression . Butyrate activation of p21WAF1 is potentiated by ZBP-89 through the recruitment of the co-activator p300 , while chronic stimulation by butyrate increases ZBP-89 gene expression correlating with cell differentiation . ZBP-89 stimulates growth arrest and apoptosis through its ability to bind the p21WAF1 promoter or its ability to form protein-protein interactions with p53 . ZBP-89 protein is elevated in a variety of gastrointestinal cancers as well as the pancreas . In particular , ZBP-89 is normally expressed in pancreatic islets and ducts and in about 30% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas .	evading growth suppressors;resisting cell death
12625783	The purpose of this study was to use the proteomics approach , which is based on high resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with multivariate correspondence analysis and mass spectrometry , to classify objectively the biochemical basis of the anti-cancer activity of the synthetic cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , bohemine ( BOH ) . The changes in the cell cycle and corresponding protein composition of the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line after treatment with BOH were evaluated and proteins differentially expressed in the BOH treated A549 cells , compared to the untreated A549 counterparts , were selected . Thirteen of these candidate proteins associated with the drug effects in vitro were identified by mass spectrometry . Many of these proteins fall into one of three functional categories : i ) metabolic pathways ( glycolysis , nucleic acid synthesis and NADPH production ) , ii ) stress response and protein folding , and iii ) cytoskeleton and exocytosis . Changes in protein expression patterns corresponded to a higher resistance of A549 lung carcinoma cells to BOH when compared to the CEM leukaemia cell line . These protein changes reflect a fine balance of the resistant versus the susceptible phenotype in response to the drug . Since BOH is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , changes in the protein expression pattern can be more generally associated with cell cycle regulation as evidenced by inhibition of cell cycling in A549 cells . Our conclusions further underline the importance of cell cycle control in both the cellular signalling and metabolic pathways .	evading growth suppressors
12626418	To investigate the significance of sialylation and sulfation of lactosylceramide in transformed cells , we established ganglioside GM3- and lactosylsulfatide ( SM3)-reconstituted cells by transfecting cDNAs of GM3 synthase and cerebroside sulfotransferase into the J5 subclone of 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma cells . The J5 clone was selected for the transfection of these genes because it lacks GM3 and SM3 but accumulates lactosylceramide . The anchorage-dependent growth of both GM3- and SM3-reconstituted cells was similar . However , anchorage-independent growth ( as measured by colony-forming ability in soft agar ) of the SM3- reconstituted cells was almost completely lost , which supports our previous observation showing the suppression of tumorigenic potential in vivo and beta1 integrin gene expression induced by the introduction of cerebroside sulfotransferase gene ( Kabayama et al. [ 2001 ] J. Biol . Chem. , 276 , 26777-26783 ) . The GM3-reconstituted cells formed a significantly higher number of colonies in soft agar compared to mock-transfected cells and began to proliferate and become resistant to apoptosis when serum was depleted , indicating that endogenous GM3 is essential for maintaining these fundamental properties of malignant cells . We also found that serum-induced ERK1/2 activation was suppressed in the GM3-reconstituted cells , suggesting that anchorage-independent cell cycle initiation by endogenous GM3 is elicited through pathway(s) independent of ERK1/2 activation . The selective down-regulation of platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF)-dependent ERK1/2 activation in the GM3-reconstituted cells was due to the substantial decreases of PDGF alpha receptor mRNA and protein , but in the SM3-reconstituted cells PDGF alpha receptor expression was similar to mock cells . Thus , endogenously produced GM3 and SM3 differentially and distinctly regulate tumor-progression ability , that is , GM3 leads the transformed phenotype of J5 cells to promotion and SM3 to abrogation .	resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling
12643451	The early stages of head and neck cancer are presumed to require a senes of genetic alterations that are not represented by a distinct clinical phenotype . Therefore , genes with altered expression in the preneoplasia may be useful for the early detection of this highly recurrent cancer . In this study , we immortalized normal human oral keratinocytes ( NHOK ) by retroviral-mediated infection of HPV 16 transforming oncogenes , E6 and E7 ( HOK16E6E7 ) . Using the Affymetrix gene chip ( U95Av2 ) , we identified 177 known genes and EST that were overexpressed at least 3-fold or above in the immortalized cells , while 133 were down-regulated compared to NHOK . Northern blot analysis showed elevated levels of p55CDC in the immortalized cells , while NHOK showed high basal expression of small proline rich protein ( SPRR2 ) . The altered expression of these genes maybe associated with cellular proliferation or differentiation and the early stages of oral carcinogenesis .	enabling replicative immortality
12664617	Recent epidemiological and experimental investigations suggest a close relationship between cyclooxygenase ( COX ) and pathogenesis of colorectal cancer . There are two isoforms , COX-1 and COX-2 , which differ in physiological functions and distribution . This study is to investigate the possible roles of both isoforms in the proliferation of colon carcinoma cells . A human colon carcinoma cell line , COLO 320DM , was transfected with an eukaryotic expression vector ( pEF-BOS ) carrying cDNA of either COX-1 or COX-2 . Both COX-1 and COX-2-expressing cells exhibited a similar enzyme activity , 8-10 nmol/10 min/mg of protein . Growth rates of both COX-expressing cells were increased by about 2 fold as compared with mock-transfected cells . The stimulated growth of the COX-expressing cells was confirmed by the increased DNA synthesis as assessed by [ 3H]thymidine incorporation . Furthermore , expression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) was markedly increased in the COX-expressing cells as examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . A COX inhibitor , indomethacin , suppressed the stimulated growth , increased DNA synthesis and induction of epidermal growth factor receptor in the COX-1 and COX-2-transfected cells . These results suggest that not only COX-2 but COX-1 is involved in the proliferation of human colon carcinoma cells through the induction of EGFR .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12665307	Neutrophils have become recognised as important contributors to the effectiveness of tumour eradication by photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . In this study , we have used the mouse SCCVII squamous cell carcinoma model to investigate the activity of neutrophils in tumours treated by PDT . Tumour levels of neutrophilic myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) demonstrated not only a massive and sustained sequestration of these cells in PDT-treated tumours but also revealed their activated state evidenced by the presence of released MPO . Among the adhesion molecules expressed on tumour vascular endothelium , ICAM-1 appears to be of primary importance in the invasion of neutrophils into PDT-treated tumours , because its functional blocking with monoclonal antibodies reduced the tumour cure rate . A marked upregulation of its ligands CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 found on neutrophils associated with PDT-treated tumours supports this assumption . To evaluate the role of inflammatory cytokines regulating neutrophil activity , neutralising antibodies were given to mice before PDT treatment . The results suggest that IL-1beta activity is critical for the therapeutic outcome , since its neutralisation diminished the cure rates of PDT-treated tumours . No significant effect was observed with anti-IL-6 and anti-TNF-alpha treatment . Further flow cytometry-based examination of neutrophils round in PDT-treated tumours revealed that these cells express MHC class II molecules , which suggests their engagement as antigen-presenting cells and involvement in the development of antitumour immune response .	tumor promoting inflammation
12718610	Investigation has been conducted to delineate the action of some phenolic compounds of natural origin in four human tumor cell lines : acute myeloblastic leukemia ( HL-60 ) , chronic myelogenic leukemia ( K-562 ) , breast adenocarcinoma ( MCF-7 ) and cervical epithelial carcinoma ( HeLa ) . In cells grown in appropriate media the phenolics curcumin , yakuchinone B , resveratrol and capsaicin exhibited growth inhibition as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion . It was evident from the results of the MTT reduction assay and [ (3)H]thymidine incorporation into nuclear DNA that the phenolics were cytotoxic and inhibited cell proliferation . Dose response studies indicated curcumin to be most cytotoxic towards HL-60 , K-562 and MCF-7 but did not show much activity in HeLa cells . On the other hand , yakuchinone B , although less active than curcumin , displayed cytotoxicity towards all four cell lines . Resveratrol was cytotoxic only in leukemic cells , while capsaicin was marginally cytotoxic . All these phenolics did not elicit any cytotoxic activity as judged by the above parameters towards lymphocytes purified from normal human blood . When cells treated with phenolics were stained with propidium iodide and examined under a fluorescent microscope , characteristic apoptotic features such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were observed . Scoring of cells with apoptotic and non-apoptotic features showed positive correlation of apoptotic index with dose of phenolic , and fragmented DNA extracted free of genomic DNA displayed on gel electrophoresis a typical ladder pattern . These phenolics which have human exposure are known cancer chemopreventive agents and their action as inducers of apoptosis in tumor cells suggest their potential use in a strategy for cancer control .	resisting cell death
12734064	We examined the influence of the level of dietary protein or vitamin E ( VE ) on oxidative damage to DNA , lipids , and protein in the liver after total body irradiation ( TBI ) with X-rays at 1 or 4 Gy . Levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine , thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances , and protein carbonyls in the liver did not differ among the groups that did not receive TBI . However , oxidative damage to lipids and protein was increased by TBI only in the 1% protein group . DNA damage , lipid peroxidation , or protein oxidation in the liver was increased by TBI in a dose-dependent manner , and the damage was consistently higher in the 1% than in the 20% protein group . In the 1% protein group , a greater decrease in relative spleen weight by TBI was also observed . Concentrations of antioxidants ( vitamins C and E and glutathione ) in the liver were lower and the concentration of nonheme iron in the liver was higher in the 1% than in the 20% protein group . Mice fed a 1% protein diet became susceptible to TBI-induced oxidative damage , and decreases in antioxidant levels and an increase in iron level were involved in the mechanism of this susceptibility . These results suggest that dietary VE and protein can prevent oxidative damage to DNA , lipid , and protein in mice subjected to TBI . Consumption of a VE-free diet significantly increased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels in DNA from mice fed the 1% protein diet with TBI , but such changes were not detected in DNA from mice fed the 20% protein diet .	tumor promoting inflammation;genomic instability and mutation
12865631	Expression of angiogenic factors is upregulated in hyperplastic mucosa adjacent to colon cancer , and this upregulation is closely associated with cancer growth and metastasis . We investigated the role of histone acetylation in vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression in hyperplastic mucosa adjacent to orthotopic colon cancer in mice . In the hyperplastic mucosa adjacent to KM12SM tumor in the cecum of athymic mice , VEGF upregulation was associated with hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF)-1alpha induction . The hyperplastic mucosa also showed hypoacetylation of histone H4 and reduction of both p53 and von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) proteins . To examine the effects of growth factors and cytokines on histone acetylation and levels of p53 , VHL and HIF-1alpha , the rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC6 was treated with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and interleukin ( IL)-15 for 35 days . Acetylated histone H4 , p53 protein and ubiquitinated protein levels were reduced , whereas HIF-1alpha production was upregulated in EGF- and IL-15-treated IEC6 cells . These findings suggest that EGF- or IL-15-induced histone H4 hypoacetylation is associated with repression of p53 and VHL genes in intestinal epithelial cells . The subsequent suppression of protein ubiquitination leads to upregulation of VEGF production by HIF-1alpha retention .	inducing angiogenesis;sustaining proliferative signaling
1295440	The effects of an anti-CD3 mAb on induction of non-MHC restricted cytolysis was investigated . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from normal donors ( 29 ) and cancer patients ( 18 ) were cultured in 100 U/ml of interleukin-2 ( rIL-2 ) with and without anti-CD3 mAb ( OKT3 , 10 ng/ml ) for the first 48 hours of incubation . Thereafter , both PBMC cultures were maintained on rIL-2 up to 20 days . PBMC proliferation was enhanced 17-fold in number by day 20 when anti-CD3 mAb and rIL-2 was present during the first 48 hours but only 3-fold by day 20 when rIL-2 alone was present . Concomitantly anti-CD3 mAb but not Lym-1 , an isotype matched control , inhibited the induction of lytic activity against both NK sensitive ( K562 ) and NK resistant ( Raji ) target cell lines . Thus the inhibitory effect is dependent on anti-CD3 mAb stimulating the CD3/TCR T-cell receptor complex . While lytic activity was dependent on the concentration of rIL-2 , inhibition of the induction phase of non-MHC restricted lytic activity was independent of the concentration of rIL-2 . Flow cytometry analysis indicated that treatment with the anti-CD3 mAb increased the percentage of CD3 positive cells , CD4 positive cells and especially CD25 positive cells , but decreased th percentage of CD56 positive cells . Supernatants from anti-CD3 mAb stimulated cultures also inhibited the induction of non-MHC restricted lytic activity . Lymphokine analysis showed that supernatants of anti-CD3 mAb stimulated cultures had higher levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma . However , TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma alone or in combination could not mediate the inhibitory effect . The inhibitory factor(s) was partially purified by sequential chromatography on matrices of controlled pore glass and Sepharose CL-6B . The molecular weight of the inhibitory factor(s) was less than 67K . These studies have identified a novel regulatory pathway controlling non-MHC restricted cytolysis . Perturbation of the T-cell CD3/TCR complex with the anti-CD3 mAb results in the secretion of a soluble mediator that down-regulates the induction of rIL-2 dependent non-MHC restricted cytolysis .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1311633	Induction of the expression of the Mr 67,000 high-affinity laminin receptor gene has been postulated as playing a role in the progression of human tumors to invasive cancers . We tested this hypothesis by examining histopathological sections of a large number of epithelial lesions of the genital tract associated with human papillomaviruses . In situ hybridization was performed with a riboprobe generated from a laminin receptor complementary DNA . Laminin receptor mRNA was expressed primarily in the less differentiated cells in normal squamous tissues and in a spectrum of squamous neoplasms . There was no net induction of mRNA per cell in intraepithelial or invasive squamous neoplasms relative to normal tissue . In contrast , laminin receptor mRNA was not expressed at a detectable level in normal glands of the uterine cervix but was dramatically induced in morphologically abnormal , human papillomavirus-positive glands , irrespective of the genotype of human papillomaviruses present . The induction occurred before any evidence of invasion , and there was no further increase during the transition from adenocarcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma . We conclude that induction of high-affinity laminin receptor gene expression is associated with the development of malignancies of cervical glandular epithelia , but the increased expression appears to correlate with the proliferative rather than the invasive properties of these cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling;activating invasion and metastasis
1327543	Mas oncogene has been shown to have focus-inducing ability in NIH 3T3 cells which are tumorigenic in vivo in nude mice . Its stable expression in a variety of cell lines conferred some angiotensin responsiveness . To understand why mas-transfected cells exhibit a transformed phenotype and if angiotensin responsiveness plays any role in this process , we studied the growth characteristics of mas-transfected 3T3 cells and demonstrated that they lose contact inhibition , exhibit foci formation , and increased DNA synthesis even in absence of serum . Our results suggest that the transformed phenotype is due to the production of a mas receptor ligand distinct from angiotensin .	evading growth suppressors
1328987	The mouse polyomavirus encodes a tumor-suppressor gene inactivator in its large T protein and a proto-oncogene activator in its middle T protein . We have used site-directed mutagenesis to selectively inactivate the former function without affecting the latter . Two mutant viruses were constructed to encode altered large T proteins that fail to bind the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene product pRB , along with normal small and middle T proteins . The pRB-binding mutants proved to be defective in immortalization of primary rat embryo fibroblasts by a variety of tests . Yet they proved capable of transforming both primary and established fibroblasts in culture . Most importantly , the inability of these mutants to bind pRB had little effect on their ability to induce tumors in mice . We conclude that induction of multiple tumor types in this system does not depend on large T-pRB interactions but rather on middle T-dependent pathways . In addition , the ability of this virus to immortalize cells in culture is not essential to its ability to induce tumors in the animal .	enabling replicative immortality
1337602	Melanocyte stimulating hormone ( alpha-MSH , alpha-melanotropin),Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Ly-Pro-Va l-NH2 , regulates melanogenesis within epidermal melanocytes of many animals . An MSH analogue ( [ Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH ) that exhibits superpotency and prolonged biological activity has been synthesized , biologically characterized , and is presently in clinical trials to determine its possible clinical use in tanning of the skin . It also has potential for the diagnosis , localization , and chemotherapy of melanoma . The effects of this analogue on the growth , metastatic behavior , and invasive potential of a melanotic variant of Cloudman S-91 murine melanoma are reported here . In an intracutaneous murine model of melanoma cell tumor growth , the analogue did not increase primary tumor growth ( size ) after the period of administration of the peptide hormone analogue and did not affect spontaneous lung metastases . Survival times for the control and melanotropin-treated groups were similar , suggesting that overall tumor burden was not affected by treatment with the hormone analogue . Last , melanoma cell invasion through a human amniotic basement membrane in vitro was not enhanced compared to untreated cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
1373558	Immunosuppression of immunoglobulin synthesis seen in patients with multiple myeloma is in part due to immunosuppressive CD5 positive B cells . In a 13 year longitudinal study of an IgA-deficient blood donor who developed multiple myeloma , the presence of immunosuppressive CD5 positive B cells and T cells preceded the diagnosis of overt multiple myeloma and the appearance of immunosuppressive monocytes . These data argue that certain immune defects may be involved in the development of myeloma and are not simply a consequence of overt malignancy .	avoiding immune destruction
1385453	The influence of cell shape on the expression of proto-oncogenes was examined in normal and malignant human cells that varied in their sensitivities to contact-inhibition of proliferation . Cells were constrained into varying degrees of roundness by plating onto culture surfaces coated with different concentrations of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate ) ( poly[HEMA] ) and assayed for proliferation capacity and levels of c-myc , c-ras , c-fos , and c-fes mRNAs . Proliferation of contact-inhibited normal CUA-1 fibroblasts and the variant HT-IFNr cells was highly coupled to cell shape . As these cells became more rounded , a critical degree of roundness was reached at which proliferation ceased . In contrast , proliferation of non-contact-inhibited malignant HT-1080 cells was independent of cell shape . Northern analysis revealed that expression of c-myc and c-ras was highly sensitive to cell shape in the normal CUA-1 cells but not in the malignant HT-1080 or variant HT-IFNr cells . Levels of c-myc and c-ras mRNAs declined to nearly undetectable levels in CUA-1 cells at degrees of roundness that correlated with loss of proliferative ability . Expression of c-fos and c-fes oncogenes were independent of cell shape in all cells tested . Quantification of transcription rates by the nuclear run-off assay showed that shape modulation of c-myc and c-ras oncogene expression occurred at the transcriptional level . These data suggest that changes in cell shape can modulate expression of certain oncogenes and that these changes correlate with the cell's ability to proliferate . Moreover , inability to regulate c-myc and c-ras oncogene expression is associated with loss of shape-dependent growth controls and contact inhibition but that loss of this regulation alone is not sufficient to release cells from contact-inhibited controls .	evading growth suppressors
1395091	Adhesion molecules play an important role in the functioning of the immune system , particularly with regard to cell-cell interactions and antigen presentation . Several adhesion molecules are expressed on Hodgkin's disease-derived cell lines and these are important in their molecular interactions as antigen presenting cells ( APC ) . There are no data regarding the expression of many of these adhesion molecules on Reed-Sternberg cells and its mononuclear variant ( Hodgkin's cells ( HC) ) present in pathological material . To obtain this information we undertook an immunohistological study on material from 18 cases of Hodgkin's disease using a panel of MoAbs to examine the expression of adhesion molecules on HC . The HC were shown to express the integrin beta 1 subfamily molecules , LFA-1 ( CD11a ) and p150,95 ( CD11c ) in high density but lacked CR3 ( CD11b ) . All of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily adhesion molecules studied were present to some degree on HC , with ICAM-2 , in particular , showing moderate to strong expression in most cases . The Hermes antigen CD44 was present in high density but leukosialin ( CD43 ) , another molecule present on diverse leucocyte types , was , in general , not detected on HC . These new data showing that ICAM-1 , ICAM-2 and LFA-3 are , like LFA-1 , expressed on HC emphasize the ability of HC to act as APC . The known adhesion molecule phenotype of the recently defined haematopoietic lineage of human dendritic cells ( DC ) is broadly similar to that of HC , perhaps supporting the hypothesis that some HC represent a malignancy of an APC ( DC ) lineage .	avoiding immune destruction
1423284	The chemotherapeutic drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum ( II ) covalently binds to DNA resulting in a variety of adducts and cross-links which are thought to be responsible for the toxicity of the drug . We have used the gel mobility shift assay to detect proteins which bind to DNA treated in vitro with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum ( II ) and have identified two complexes which bind with increased affinity to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum ( II)-damaged DNA . Using monoclonal antibodies we have shown that one complex , B1 , contains human single-stranded DNA binding protein , a protein known to be involved in the in vitro repair synthesis assay of mammalian excision repair .	genomic instability and mutation
1423296	To elucidate the mechanism of the synergistic cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) ( CDDP ) , we studied the interaction of these agents using a human squamous carcinoma cell line ( HST-1 ) . Exposure to 5-FU for 24 h and to CDDP for 1 h produced a 50% inhibitory concentration of 1.0 micrograms/ml ( 7.7 microM ) and 2.5 micrograms/ml ( 8.3 microM ) , respectively . The cytotoxic action of CDDP was augmented , and a greater than additive effect was observed when the cells were exposed to 5-FU ( 1.0 micrograms/ml ; 7.7 microM ) for 24 h before the CDDP treatment . This synergistic activity was maximal when the interval between 5-FU and CDDP exceeded 24 h . In contrast , the cytotoxicity of CDDP was attenuated when it preceded the exposure to 5-FU . Thymidine did not alter the 5-FU-CDDP interaction . Evaluation of the kinetics of the removal of DNA interstrand cross-links , measured by alkaline elution , showed a significant reduction of this removal in the cells exposed to 5-FU followed by CDDP with a drug-free interval of 48 h , as compared with cells exposed to CDDP alone , or to 5-FU immediately followed by CDDP , although no differences were found in the formation of DNA interstrand cross-links by CDDP among these cells . No significant differences in the accumulation of intracellular platinum were detected by atomic absorption spectrophotometry . These findings suggest that 5-FU modulates the repair of platinum-DNA adducts , thereby potentiating the antitumor activity of CDDP .	genomic instability and mutation
1451050	BACKGROUND Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) are a gene family of zinc enzymes capable of degrading almost all of the extracellular matrix macromolecules in vivo . Their enzymic activities are believed to be responsible for tumor invasion and metastasis . METHODS In this study , using peroxidase-antiperoxidase method , monospecific antisera against MMP-1 ( tissue collagenase ) , MMP-2 ( type IV collagenase/72-kilodalton [ KD ] gelatinase ) , and MMP-3 ( stromelysin ) were applied to 29 squamous cell carcinomas and normal epithelium of the esophagus to identify cells synthesizing and secreting these enzymes . RESULTS Immunoreactivity of MMP-1 , -2 , and -3 was observed in small cancer nests of the deeply invasive or marginal portion of the tumor . Among the 29 patients studied , the presence of at least one MMP was observed in 17 ( 58.6% ) . All three enzymes were observed in six ( 20.6% ) patients , MMP-2 and -3 in five ( 17.2% ) patients , only MMP-2 in three ( 10.3% ) patients , and MMP-3 alone in three ( 10.3% ) patients . There was a good correlation among histologic stage and tumor invasion , lymph node metastasis , and MMP expression . In particular , expression of MMP-2 and -3 was closely related to lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion . CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that MMP , especially MMP-2 and -3 , play an important role in tumor invasion and metastasis and that analysis of MMP-2 and -3 production is useful for evaluation of malignant potential in esophageal carcinoma .	activating invasion and metastasis
1457364	Nine primary pulmonary carcinomas , one metastatic carcinoma , and two malignant pleural mesotheliomas have been analysed for the expression at the mRNA level of metalloproteinases ( MPs ) and tissue inhibitors of MPs ( TIMPs ) . In situ hybridisation showed TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 transcripts predominantly over tumour stroma and gelatinases evenly distributed over both stromal and tumour cells . While both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were expressed in non-neoplastic lungs ( NNL ) as well as in carcinomas , stromelysin 3 ( ST3 ) , 92 kDa gelatinase and interstitial collagenase were expressed only by carcinomas . Expression of these MPs by carcinomas was independent of histologic type and such tumour features as fibrosis or necrosis . The consistent expression of ST3 by all of the carcinomas examined and absence of its expression in NNL indicates that ST3 production is likely associated with the malignant phenotype . However , since 92 kDa gelatinase and interstitial collagenase transcripts were found in some but not all tumour samples , their expression is not a uniform feature of pulmonary carcinomas . The possible prognostic significance of the expression of the latter two enzymes by carcinomas remains to be established .	resisting cell death
1458468	Studies were performed to test the hypothesis that urethane-induced murine lung tumors exhibit xenobiotic resistance and alterations in pulmonary cytochrome P-450 enzymes. 1,1-Dichloroethylene , naphthalene , and paraquat were administered to tumor-bearing and control mice to elicit acute lung cytotoxicity , and responses were evaluated in tumors ( papillary and solid ) , uninvolved surrounding tissue , and untreated control lung. 1,1-Dichloroethylene ( 125 mg/kg , i.p. ) and naphthalene ( 225 mg/kg , i.p. ) caused preferential necrosis of Clara cells in control lungs and uninvolved tissue of tumor-bearing lungs . In contrast , papillary and solid tumors were both resistant to 1,1-dichloroethylene-induced cytotoxicity . Paraquat ( 10 , 20 mg/kg , i.v. ) elicited Clara cell damage in control lungs and uninvolved lung tissue of tumor-bearing mice , with minor disruption of the alveolar epithelium . Neither papillary nor solid tumors sustained any apparent cell damage from paraquat . Immunoblots of P-450 enzymes confirmed constitutive expression of CYP2B1 in control lung and uninvolved lung tissue of tumor-bearing mice , but this P-450 enzyme was not detected in either adenomas or carcinomas . Lung CYP1A1 was inducible by beta-naphthoflavone in non-tumor-bearing mice and uninvolved tissue of tumor-bearing mice ; however , inducibility was decreased in adenomas and abolished in carcinomas . These results demonstrate resistance of lung tumor cells to chemically induced cytotoxicity and diminished expression of cytochrome P-450 enzymes in tumors .	resisting cell death
1459429	We studied the effects of double-strand breaks on intramolecular extrachromosomal homologous recombination in mammalian cells . Pairs of defective herpes thymidine kinase ( tk ) sequences were introduced into mouse Ltk- cells on a DNA molecule that also contained a neo gene under control of the SV40 early promoter/enhancer . With the majority of the constructs used , gene conversions or double crossovers , but not single crossovers , were recoverable . DNA was linearized with various restriction enzymes prior to transfection . Recombination events producing a functional tk gene were monitored by selecting for tk-positive colonies . For double-strand breaks placed outside of the region of homology , maximal recombination frequencies were measured when a break placed the two tk sequences downstream from the SV40 early promoter/enhancer . We observed no relationship between recombination frequency and either the distance between a break and the tk sequences or the distance between the tk sequences . The quantitative effects of the breaks appeared to depend on the degree of homology between the tk sequences . We also observed that inverted repeats recombined as efficiently as direct repeats . The data indicated that the breaks influenced recombination indirectly , perhaps by affecting the binding of a factor(s) to the SV40 promoter region which in turn stimulated or inhibited recombination of the tk sequences . Taken together , we believe that our results provide strong evidence for the existence of a pathway for extrachromosomal homologous recombination in mammalian cells that is distinct from single-strand annealing . We discuss the possibility that intrachromosomal and extrachromosomal recombination have mechanisms in common .	genomic instability and mutation
1459734	We analyzed several factors which could influence the immunogenicity of colon tumor cells , using a series of clones derived from a single chemically induced rat adenocarcinoma cell line . These clones display variable tumorigenic potential in syngeneic immunocompetent animals , and it has been established that in this model the tumorigenicity of the cells depends on their ability to escape immune surveillance . The results show an absence of relationship between tumorigenicity and expression of MHC-class-I antigens , cell adhesion to rat fibroblasts or fibroblast extracellular matrix . The secretion of latent and active TGF beta I appeared to be quite variable from one clone to the other , but was unrelated to tumorigenicity . Unexpectedly , some regressive clones produced elevated levels of this cytokine , suggesting that in this model , spontaneous secretion of TGF beta I is not sufficient to impair the immune system of the host . In contrast , the more tumorigenic clones were more resistant than less tumorigenic ones to cytotoxicity mediated by NK or LAK cells . They also showed arrest of cell proliferation after reaching confluence , something not observed in the less tumorigenic clones . Finally , the strongest relationship with tumorigenicity was found for expression of blood-group carbohydrate antigens . Increased expression of blood-group-H antigen and , conversely , decreased expression of beta-galactoside precursors of this antigen correlated with increased tumorigenicity .	avoiding immune destruction
14694722	OBJECTIVE To explore the adduct characteristics of styrene and DNA . METHODS The adduct reactions between styrene , urinary mandalic acid(MA) , phenylglyoxalic acid(PGA) , mercapturic acid of styrene ( UMA ) and DNA were studied by ultraviolet spectral analysis . The SO-DNA adducts by 32P-post labeled method , the chemical structures of SO-DNA adducts by GC-MS and NMR were also studied . RESULTS SO combined with DNA at O6 , N2 positions of dGMP to form six adducts , but styrene , urinary mandalic acid , phenylglyoxalic acid and mercapturic acid of styrene did not react with DNA to form adduct . CONCLUSIONS Styrene formed adduct with DNA through its active center metabolite--SO after entering the body . SO combined with DNA at O6 , N2 positions of dGMP to form adducts . If these DNA adducts are not repaired or are mis-repaired before cell duplication , the gene mutation and chemical damage would happen . No adduct reactions are seen among other metabolites of styrene .	genomic instability and mutation
1470779	This is a case report of a 69-year-old woman with sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , which was diagnosed clinically as hemangioma . She was first admitted to our university hospital , complaining of general fatigue in December , 1988 , and cholelithiasis and liver cirrhosis with hepatic tumor in Segment 8 were diagnosed . The serum AFP level was within normal range , and the tumor was diagnosed as hemangioma radiologically . She underwent only cholecystectomy and was well without any therapy for the liver tumor up until March in 1991 when she was readmitted to our university hospital due to rapidly progressive liver dysfunction . The size of the liver tumor was unchanged . Despite intensive care , she died of hepatic failure due to cirrhosis in a decompensation state . At autopsy , a well defined yellowish white tumor of 3 cm in maximum diameter was seen in the cirrhotic liver . Although the largest part of the tumor revealed necrosis and hyalinization , a sarcomatoid part composed of spindle-shaped cells was noted in the peripheral portion . In addition , some necrotic ghost cells , probably hepatocellular carcinoma , were also noted . Low molecular cytokeratin , which is always found in HCCs , was seen in spindle-shaped sarcomatoid cells . The liver tumor was diagnosed as sarcomatoid HCC from these pathological findings . We report this histologically unusual HCC with an immunohistochemical study .	resisting cell death
1478710	Cells dissociated from spontaneous and transplanted tumours of C3HJax mammary gland have been cultured on polylysine and gelatin substrates . The isolated cells proliferated to form monolayers with high degree of organoid structure as indicated by formation of alveolar cavities . Differences were observed in the cell attachment , growth pattern , number and size of alveolar cavities , cells which lined the cavity and cell morphology on polylysine and gelatin substrates as compared to conventional cell culture plastic surface . On polylysine more than 90% cells attached rapidly , within 15-45 min after plating , with or without serum and formed confluent monolayers marked by presence of large and small alveolar cavities . Multiple interacting cell types took part in organization of the cavity . Cells lining the cavity constantly proliferated and rearranged to expand it . On gelatin , 60-70% cells attached over a period of 6-24 hr in presence of serum and formed confluent monolayers dominated by small alveolar cavities . Cells forming the cavities were epithelial in nature and cavities once formed did not increase in size . Upon subculture , the cell morphology on these substrates was strikingly different . On polylysine , the predominant cell type had numerous irregular microvilli whereas on gelatin , cells had smoother boundaries with a few stunted cytoplasmic extensions . The cell attachment on conventional surface was low , 40-50% . When seeded at high cell density , formation of alveolar cavities was suppressed and at low cell density , cultures were marked by contact inhibition of cells and failure to attain confluence . These results suggest differential behaviour and interaction of mammary tumour epithelium with the substrates used .	evading growth suppressors
1486841	Prevention of environmentally related cancer will be enhanced by the availability of sensitive early warning systems and by improvements in quantitative assessment of human risks . Accordingly , we have carried out a series of molecular epidemiologic studies aimed at validating a panel of biologic markers , including carcinogen-DNA and -protein adducts , sister chromatid exchange , micronucleus formation , DNA strand breaks , and DNA repair capacity . Results from three such studies illustrate the usefulness of these biomarkers in elucidating low-dose-response relationships , correlations between biomarkers , and the range of variation in biomarkers between individuals exposed to similar concentrations of carcinogens . Low-level workplace or ambient exposures to styrene , ethylene oxide , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) were associated with significant increases in both molecular dose of carcinogens ( adducts ) and various markers of preclinical effects . Correlations between biomarkers varied by exposure . For example , in the styrene study , sister chromatid exchange frequency was not correlated with any of the markers , in contrast to the studies of ethylene oxide and PAH . Significant molecular effects were observed not only in occupationally exposed people but also in residents of an area in Poland characterized by high levels of air pollution . For example , the mean PAH-DNA level in exposed residents ( winter sample ) was 30.4 adducts per 10(8) nucleotides . This level was significantly higher than that of adducts seen in summer samples from the same area ( 4.2/10(8) , or in winter samples from residents of a rural area ( 11.01/10(8) . Significant seasonal variation in PAH-DNA adduct formation in this group was consistent with recorded fluctuations in air pollution levels . Striking interindividual variation was observed in all three exposed populations .	genomic instability and mutation
15515527	OBJECTIVE To evaluate the difference of angiogenic factors PDGF/dThdPase,VEGF expression and microvessel density ( MVD ) in primary hypopharyngeal tumor and metastasis lymph nodes . METHOD The author studied immunohistochemically a series of 48 primary hypopharyngeal carcinoma patients and metastasis lymph nodes were calculated . RESULT The percentage of VEGF was 25.38% in primary tumor and 21.52% in lymph nodes . No significant difference was found . The percentage of PDGF/dThdPase was 29.59% in primary tumor and and 21.2% in lymph nodes . This showed significent difference . VEGF showed significent difference between live and death group(P &lt ; 0.05 ) and among differentiation group ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) . MVD showed significant difference between live and death group , early and late stage group , and T1-2 and T3-4 group ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) . There were statistically significant correlations between the score of PDGF/ dThdPase , or VEGF and the score of MVD respectively . CONCLUSION The present study suggests that there was a correlation between VEGF or PDGF and MVD . VEGF and MVD were possible to be prognostic discriminators in hypopharyngeal carcinoma . PDGF expression in lymph nodes was significant higher than in primary tumors , and MVD expression in primary tumor was significant higher than in lymph nodes .	inducing angiogenesis
1576706	Cellular senescence is the genetically programmed cessation of cellular proliferation . We have recently mapped a putative senescence gene(s) on the X chromosome of Chinese hamster embryo ( CHE ) cells . In the present study , we have utilized microcell-mediated chromosome transfer ( microcell fusion ) to test whether : ( i ) the human X chromosome exhibits similar genetic potential to induce senescence and ( ii ) the deletion or inactivation of the X-linked senescence gene(s) in CHE cells is associated with nickel-induced immortalization . A normal CHE or human X chromosome was first introduced into mouse-cell hybrids , then transferred by microcell fusion into a nickel-transformed , immortal male CHE cell line ( Ni-2/TGR ) with an X deletion ( Xq1 ) . Microcell fusion of the normal CHE X chromosome into tumorigenic Ni-2/TGR cells yielded senescence of all X recipient clones . The normal human X chromosome induced dominant senescence of tumorigenic Ni-2/TGR cells in only 17% of the resulting microcell hybrids ( 14/81 ) . Karyotypic analyses of 13 non-senescing human X chromosome-derived microcell hybrid clones revealed that none of these clones retained the complete X. A normal CHE X chromosome induced senescence of 75% of hybrids obtained with another immortal and tumorigenic nickel-transformed male CHE cell line ( Ni-6/TGR ) , which exhibited no visible deletion of the X chromosome , while the normal human X chromosome , only induced senescence in 19% of these hybrids . Transfer of the normal CHE or human X chromosome into spontaneously transformed and tumorigenic cell lines , CHO/TGR or V79/TGR , had little or no effect on their growth . These data suggest that both human and CHE cells possess similar X-linked genetic activities that regulate the process of cellular senescence , and that in Chinese hamster cells nickel-induced immortalization but not that of CHO or V79 cells is associated with inactivation of an X-linked senescence gene .	enabling replicative immortality
1582349	We assayed the estrogen and progesterone cytosolic receptors by using the enzyme immunoassay method , the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) cell surface receptors by using 125I-labeled hormone , and the levels of polyamines ( putrescine , spermine , and spermidine ) by using a high-pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) procedure in neoplastic and surrounding normal tissues of patients with colorectal cancer . Our findings show that mean polyamine levels in neoplastic tissue were approximately two-fold greater than the levels in normal colonic mucosa . Estrogen and progesterone receptorial content in normal mucosa were twofold greater than those in neoplastic tissue . No significant differences in EGF receptors were found between colonic cancer tissue and the surrounding normal tissues . The correlations we found between 1 ) estrogen and polyamine levels and 2 ) estrogen and EGF binding suggest the existence of a modulation of the estrogens on colonic mucosa cell proliferation . Furthermore , there was no significant dependency of polyamine and receptor concentrations from the tumor site , the histologic differentiation , or the age and sex of patients .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1582420	Loss of telomeric DNA during cell proliferation may play a role in ageing and cancer . Since telomeres permit complete replication of eukaryotic chromosomes and protect their ends from recombination , we have measured telomere length , telomerase activity and chromosome rearrangements in human cells before and after transformation with SV40 or Ad5 . In all mortal populations , telomeres shortened by approximately 65 bp/generation during the lifespan of the cultures . When transformed cells reached crisis , the length of the telomeric TTAGGG repeats was only approximately 1.5 kbp and many dicentric chromosomes were observed . In immortal cells , telomere length and frequency of dicentric chromosomes stabilized after crisis . Telomerase activity was not detectable in control or extended lifespan populations but was present in immortal populations . These results suggest that chromosomes with short ( TTAGGG)n tracts are recombinogenic , critically shortened telomeres may be incompatible with cell proliferation and stabilization of telomere length by telomerase may be required for immortalization .	enabling replicative immortality
19543830	The glycolytic phenotype is a widespread phenomenon in solid cancer forms , including breast cancer . Dichloroacetate ( DCA ) has recently been proposed as a novel and relatively non-toxic anti-cancer agent that can reverse the glycolytic phenotype in cancer cells through the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase . We have examined the effect of DCA against breast cancer cells , including in a highly metastatic in vivo model . The growth of several breast cancer cell lines was found to be inhibited by DCA in vitro . Further examination of 13762 MAT rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells found that reversal of the glycolytic phenotype by DCA correlated with the inhibition of proliferation without any increase in cell death . This was despite a small but significant increase in caspase 3/7 activity , which may sensitize cancer cells to other apoptotic triggers . In vivo , DCA caused a 58% reduction in the number of lung metastases observed macroscopically after injection of 13762 MAT cells into the tail vein of rats ( P = 0.0001 , n &gt ; or = 9 per group ) . These results demonstrate that DCA has anti-proliferative properties in addition to pro-apoptotic properties , and can be effective against highly metastatic disease in vivo , highlighting its potential for clinical use .	cellular energetics;resisting cell death;activating invasion and metastasis
19840828	Polyphenols are widely distributed in plants and known for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties . Areca nut , rich in polyphenols , is the major component of betel quid and we have previously shown that the extract of areca nut can induce oxidative stress in vitro . In this study , we have further pinpointed that areca nut extract ( ANE ) contains catechin based procyanidins which range from dimers to decamers and polymers ; this was carried out by HPLC and electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry ( ESI/MS ) . To quantify their antioxidant potential , oligomeric and polymeric procyanidins of ANE were separated and evaluated using the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity ( TEAC ) assay . The results clearly demonstrated that the antioxidant capacity of the ANE procyanidins increased with the degree of polymerization . The anti-inflammatory potential of ANE was also tested using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-treated human oral cancer SAS cells . ANE inhibited TPA-induced cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) protein expression at low doses , which correlated with the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in the SAS cells . Furthermore , feeding rats with ANE at 1 and 10mg/kg/day for 5days significantly repressed carrageenan-induced inflammatory exudates and PGE(2) formation . In conclusion , ANE , which contains catechins based oligomeric and polymeric procyanidins , regulates COX-2 expression in vitro and possess anti-inflammatory potential in vivo .	tumor promoting inflammation
19895865	Chromated copper arsenate , which is used worldwide as a wood preservative , can adversely affect human health . Accumulating evidence suggests that chromium ( Cr ) and arsenic ( As ) can potentially disrupt the redox balance and cause respiratory diseases and cancer in humans . The present study was designed to determine the combined toxic effects of these metals in the lungs and to clarify the specific molecules that are stimulated by combined exposure to both metals . Male C57BL/6J mice were intratracheally instilled with arsenate [ As(V) ] , hexavalent chromium [ Cr(VI) ] , or a combination of both metals . Mice were sacrificed 2 days after treatment to collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue samples . Inflammation , cytotoxicity , apoptosis , and oxidative stress markers were measured . Our results indicated that administration of Cr(VI) alone or in combination with As(V) induced neutrophil-dominant inflammation as well as phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases ; effects of treatment with As(V) alone were comparatively less potent . By analyzing the production of interleukin-6 and activity of lactate dehydrogenase and caspase , we confirmed that co-treatment intensified pulmonary injury and that it was accompanied by oxidative stress , as confirmed by marked increases in the production of reactive oxygen species , reduced glutathione content , and thioredoxin reductase ( TRXRD ) activity . Expressed mRNA levels of heme oxygenase-1 , glutamylcysteine ligase , glutathione peroxidase 2 , thioredoxin ( TRX ) 1 , and TRXRD1 were also enhanced by co-treatment , whereas treatment with As(V) alone reduced the mRNA expression level of TRX2 . Our data suggest that co-treatment with As(V) exacerbated Cr(VI)-induced pulmonary injury and that this effect may be exerted through a disruption in the balance among several antioxidant genes .	tumor promoting inflammation
19950199	UNLABELLED ABC transporters like P-glycoprotein ( P-gp/ABCB1 ) are membrane proteins responsible for the transport of toxic compounds out of non-malignant cells and tumor tissue . AIM To investigate the effect of glycolysis and the tissue redox state on P-gp expression in multicellular tumor spheroids derived from prostate adenocarcinoma cells ( DU-145 ) , glioma cells ( Gli36 ) , and the human cervix carcinoma cell line KB-3-1 transfected with a P-gp-EGFP fusion gene that allows monitoring of P-gp expression in living cells . During cell culture of DU-145 , Gli36 , and KB-3-1 tumor spheroids P-gp expression was observed as well as increased lactate and decreased pyruvate levels and expression of glycolytic enzymes . Inhibition of glycolysis for 24 h by either iodoacetate ( IA ) or 2-deoxy-D-glucose ( 2-DDG ) downregulated P-gp expression which was reversed upon coincubation with the radical scavenger ebselen as shown by semi-quantitative immunohistochemisty in DU-145 and Gli36 tumor spheroids , and by EGFP fluorescence in KB-3-1 tumor spheroids . Consequently endogenous ROS generation in DU-145 tumor spheroids was increased in the presence of either IA or 2-DDG , which was abolished upon coincubation with ebselen . Exogenous addition of pyruvate significantly reduced ROS generation , increased P-gp expression as well as efflux of the P-gp substrate doxorubicin . Doxorubicin transport was significantly blunted by 2-DDG and IA , indicating that inhibition of glycolysis reversed the multidrug resistance phenotype . In summary our data demonstrate that P-gp expression in tumor spheroids is closely related to the glycolytic metabolism of tumor cells and can be downregulated by glycolysis inhibitors via mechanisms that involve changes in the cellular redox state .	cellular energetics
20008136	Odontogenic tumors originate from the remains of migrating enamel epithelium after the completion of normal tooth genesis . These enamel epithelium remnants exhibit the ability to recapitulate the events that occur during tooth formation . Several lines of evidence suggest that aberrance in the signaling pathways similar to the ones that are used during tooth development , including the WNT pathway , might be the cause of odontogenic tumorigenesis and maintenance . In this study we demonstrated that WNT5A expression was intense in both the epithelial component of ameloblastomas , the most common epithelial odontogenic tumor , and in this tumor's likely precursor cell , the enamel epithelium located at the cervical loop of normal developing human tooth buds . Additionally , when WNT5A was overexpressed in enamel epithelium cells ( LS-8 ) , the clones expressing high levels of WNT5A ( S ) exhibited characteristics of tumorigenic cells , including growth factor independence , loss of anchorage dependence , loss of contact inhibition , and tumor formation in immunocompromised mice . Moreover , overexpression of WNT5A drastically increased LS-8 cell migration and actin reorganization when compared with controls . Suppression of endogenous WNT5A in LS-8 cells ( AS ) greatly impaired their migration and AS cells failed to form significant actin reorganization and membrane protrusion was rarely seen . Taken together , our data indicate that WNT5A signaling is important in modulating tumorigenic behaviors of enamel epithelium cells in ameloblastomas .	evading growth suppressors
20043883	Histone H3 methylation at lysine 4 ( K4 ) is associated with euchromatic regions and is thought to be important for the transcriptional activation of genes during differentiation . In this study , we found that di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 at K4 and acetylation of histones H3 and H4 from the promoter/enhancer to the transcribed region close to the transcription initiation site of the solute carrier family 2 , member 5 ( SLC2A5 ) gene , and its expression , were induced by differentiation of intestine-like Caco-2 cells . These effects were accompanied by contact inhibition of cell growth of these cells . Furthermore , these modifications were induced by co-treatment with a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone and a p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD89059 . Our results suggest that methylation of histone H3 at K4 and acetylation of histones H3 and H4 are involved in SLC2A5 gene induction associated with intestinal differentiation of Caco-2 cells .	evading growth suppressors
20070897	BACKGROUND Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality among US men . Epidemiological evidence suggests that high vitamin D status protects men from prostate cancer and the active form of vitamin D , 1alpha,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1,25(OH)2D ) has anti-cancer effects in cultured prostate cells . Still , the molecular mechanisms and the gene targets for vitamin D-mediated prostate cancer prevention are unknown . RESULTS We examined the effect of 1,25(OH)2D ( +/- 100 nM , 6 , 24 , 48 h ) on the transcript profile of proliferating RWPE1 cells , an immortalized , non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cell line that is growth arrested by 1,25(OH)2D ( Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 , n = 4/treatment per time and dose ) . Our analysis revealed many transcript level changes at a 5% false detection rate : 6 h , 1571 ( 61% up ) , 24 h , 1816 ( 60% up ) , 48 h , 3566 ( 38% up). 288 transcripts were regulated similarly at all time points ( 182 up , 80 down ) and many of the promoters for these transcripts contained putative vitamin D response elements . Functional analysis by pathway or Gene Set Analysis revealed early suppression of WNT , Notch , NF-kB , and IGF1 signaling . Transcripts related to inflammation were suppressed at 6 h ( e.g . IL-1 pathway ) and suppression of proinflammatory pathways continued at later time points ( e.g . IL-17 and IL-6 pathways ) . There was also evidence for induction of anti-angiogenic pathways and induction of transcripts for protection from oxidative stress or maintenance of cell redox homeostasis at 6 h . CONCLUSIONS Our data reveal of large number of potential new , direct vitamin D target genes relevant to prostate cancer prevention . In addition , our data suggests that rather than having a single strong regulatory effect , vitamin D orchestrates a pattern of changes within prostate epithelial cells that limit or slow carcinogenesis .	tumor promoting inflammation;inducing angiogenesis
20074151	BACKGROUND AND AIMS Hepatitis C virus ( HCV)-induced chronic inflammation may induce oxidative stress which could compromise the repair of damaged DNA , rendering cells more susceptible to spontaneous or mutagen-induced alterations , the underlying cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma . In the current study we examined the induction of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) resulting from HCV infection and evaluated its effect on the host DNA damage and repair machinery . METHODS HCV infected human hepatoma cells were analyzed to determine ( i ) ROS , ( ii ) 8-oxoG and ( iii ) DNA glycosylases NEIL1 , NEIL2 , OGG1 . Liver biopsies were analyzed for NEIL1 . RESULTS Human hepatoma cells infected with HCV JFH-1 showed 30-60-fold increases in ROS levels compared to uninfected cells . Levels of the oxidatively modified guanosine base 8-oxoguanine ( 8-oxoG ) were significantly increased sixfold in the HCV-infected cells . Because DNA glycosylases are the enzymes that remove oxidized nucleotides , their expression in HCV-infected cells was analyzed . NEIL1 but not OGG1 or NEIL2 gene expression was impaired in HCV-infected cells . In accordance , we found reduced glycosylase ( NEIL1-specific ) activity in HCV-infected cells . The antioxidant N-acetyl cystein ( NAC ) efficiently reversed the NEIL1 repression by inhibiting ROS induction by HCV . NEIL1 expression was also partly restored when virus-infected cells were treated with interferon ( IFN ) . HCV core and to a lesser extent NS3-4a and NS5A induced ROS , and downregulated NEIL1 expression . Liver biopsy specimens showed significant impairment of NEIL1 levels in HCV-infected patients with advanced liver disease compared to patients with no disease . CONCLUSION Collectively , the data indicate that HCV induction of ROS and perturbation of NEIL1 expression may be mechanistically involved in progression of liver disease and suggest that antioxidant and antiviral therapies can reverse these deleterious effects of HCV in part by restoring function of the DNA repair enzyme/s .	tumor promoting inflammation;genomic instability and mutation
20080624	Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) is a high molecular weight protein serine/threonine kinase that plays a central role in the maintenance of genomic integrity by activating cell cycle checkpoints and promoting repair of DNA double-strand breaks . Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms for ATM expression itself . MicroRNAs are naturally existing regulators that modulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner . Here , we show that a human microRNA , miR-421 , suppresses ATM expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region ( 3'UTR ) of ATM transcripts . Ectopic expression of miR-421 resulted in S-phase cell cycle checkpoint changes and an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation , creating a cellular phenotype similar to that of cells derived from ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) patients . Blocking the interaction between miR-421 and ATM 3'UTR with an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide rescued the defective phenotype caused by miR-421 overexpression , indicating that ATM mediates the effect of miR-421 on cell cycle checkpoint and radiosensitivity . Overexpression of the N-Myc transcription factor , an oncogene frequently amplified in neuroblastoma , induced miR-421 expression , which , in turn , down-regulated ATM expression , establishing a linear signaling pathway that may contribute to N-Myc-induced tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma . Taken together , our findings implicate a previously undescribed regulatory mechanism for ATM expression and ATM-dependent DNA damage response and provide several potential targets for treating neuroblastoma and perhaps A-T .	evading growth suppressors;genomic instability and mutation
20081839	DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) trigger ATM ( ataxia telangiectasia mutated ) signalling and elicit genomic rearrangements and chromosomal fragmentation if misrepaired or unrepaired . Although most DSB repair is ATM-independent , approximately 15% of ionizing radiation ( IR)-induced breaks persist in the absence of ATM-signalling. 53BP1 ( p53-binding protein 1 ) facilitates ATM-dependent DSB repair but is largely dispensable for ATM activation or checkpoint arrest . ATM promotes DSB repair within heterochromatin by phosphorylating KAP-1 ( KRAB-associated protein 1 , also known as TIF1beta , TRIM28 or KRIP-1 ; ref. 2 ) . Here , we show that the ATM signalling mediator proteins MDC1 , RNF8 , RNF168 and 53BP1 are also required for heterochromatic DSB repair . Although KAP-1 phosphorylation is critical for 53BP1-mediated repair , overall phosphorylated KAP-1 ( pKAP-1 ) levels are only modestly affected by 53BP1 loss. pKAP-1 is transiently pan-nuclear but also forms foci overlapping with gammaH2AX in heterochromatin . Cells that do not form 53BP1 foci , including human RIDDLE ( radiosensitivity , immunodeficiency , dysmorphic features and learning difficulties ) syndrome cells , fail to form pKAP-1 foci. 53BP1 amplifies Mre11-NBS1 accumulation at late-repairing DSBs , concentrating active ATM and leading to robust , localized pKAP-1 . We propose that ionizing-radiation induced foci ( IRIF ) spatially concentrate ATM activity to promote localized alterations in regions of chromatin otherwise inhibitory to repair .	genomic instability and mutation
20097285	Mutations in the gene encoding cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase ( SOD1 ) have been linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( FALS ) . However the molecular mechanisms of motor neuron death are multi-factorial and remain unclear . Here we examined DNA damage , p53 activity and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells transfected to achieve low-level expression of either wild-type or mutant Gly(93)--&gt;Ala ( G93A ) SOD1 , typical of FALS . DNA damage was investigated by evaluating the levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-oxodGuo ) and DNA strand breaks . Significantly higher levels of DNA damage , increased p53 activity , and a greater percentage of apoptotic cells were observed in SH-SY5Y cells transfected with G93A SOD1 when compared to cells overexpressing wild-type SOD1 and untransfected cells . Western blot , FACS , and confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that G93A SOD1 is present in the nucleus in association with DNA . Nuclear G93A SOD1 has identical superoxide dismutase activity but displays increased peroxidase activity when compared to wild-type SOD1 . These results indicate that the G93A mutant SOD1 association with DNA might induce DNA damage and trigger the apoptotic response by activating p53 . This toxic activity of mutant SOD1 in the nucleus may play an important role in the complex mechanisms associated with motor neuron death observed in ALS pathogenesis .	genomic instability and mutation;resisting cell death
20098673	During tumorigenesis , cells acquire immortality in association with the development of genomic instability . However , it is still elusive how genomic instability spontaneously generates during the process of tumorigenesis . Here , we show that precancerous DNA lesions induced by oncogene acceleration , which induce situations identical to the initial stages of cancer development , trigger tetraploidy/aneuploidy generation in association with mitotic aberration . Although oncogene acceleration primarily induces DNA replication stress and the resulting lesions in the S phase , these lesions are carried over into the M phase and cause cytokinesis failure and genomic instability . Unlike directly induced DNA double-strand breaks , DNA replication stress-associated lesions are cryptogenic and pass through cell-cycle checkpoints due to limited and ineffective activation of checkpoint factors . Furthermore , since damaged M-phase cells still progress in mitotic steps , these cells result in chromosomal mis-segregation , cytokinesis failure and the resulting tetraploidy generation . Thus , our results reveal a process of genomic instability generation triggered by precancerous DNA replication stress .	evading growth suppressors;genomic instability and mutation
20100866	p32/gC1qR/C1QBP/HABP1 is a mitochondrial/cell surface protein overexpressed in certain cancer cells . Here we show that knocking down p32 expression in human cancer cells strongly shifts their metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) to glycolysis . The p32 knockdown cells exhibited reduced synthesis of the mitochondrial-DNA-encoded OXPHOS polypeptides and were less tumorigenic in vivo . Expression of exogenous p32 in the knockdown cells restored the wild-type cellular phenotype and tumorigenicity . Increased glucose consumption and lactate production , known as the Warburg effect , are almost universal hallmarks of solid tumors and are thought to favor tumor growth . However , here we show that a protein regularly overexpressed in some cancers is capable of promoting OXPHOS . Our results indicate that high levels of glycolysis , in the absence of adequate OXPHOS , may not be as beneficial for tumor growth as generally thought and suggest that tumor cells use p32 to regulate the balance between OXPHOS and glycolysis .	cellular energetics
20134230	The contribution of a type II restriction-modification system ( R-M system ) to genome integrity and cell viability was investigated . We established experimental conditions which enabled the achievement of hemimethylated and unmethylated states for the specific bases of the recognition sequences of the host's DNA . To achieve this , we constructed the MboII R-M system containing only one ( i.e . M2.MboII ) out of two functional MboII methyltransferases found in Moraxella bovis . Using the incomplete R-M system we were able to perturb the balance between methylation and restriction in an inducible manner . We demonstrate that upon the SOS-induced DNA repair in the mitomycin C treated cells , restriction significantly reduces cell viability . Similar results for the well-studied wild type EcoRI R-M system , expressed constitutively in Escherichia coli , were obtained . Our data provide further insights into the benefits and disadvantages of maintaining of a type II R-M system , highlighting its impact on host cell fitness .	genomic instability and mutation
20138826	Acidosis commonly observed in solid tumors like pancreatic cancer promotes genetic instability and selection of a more malignant phenotype of cancer cells . Overexpression or activation of integral membrane proteins mediating H+ efflux may contribute to extracellular acidification . Neurotensin ( NT ) induces intracellular alkalinization and stimulates interleukin-8 production in pancreatic cancer cells and , as demonstrated here , the stable NT analog Lys(8)-psi-Lys(9)NT(8-13) enhances the amiloride-sensitive , Na+-dependent transmembrane H+ flux by a factor of 2.05+/-0.28 and 2.69+/-0.07 in BxPC-3 and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells , respectively , by phosphorylation of the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 ( NHE1 ) . Human genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed to detect effects of Lys(8)-psi-Lys(9)NT(8-13) on BxPC-3 cells . Results indicated upregulation of genes involved in regulation of NHE1 , hypoxic response and glycolysis in response to Lys(8)-psi-Lys(9)NT(8-13) even under normoxic conditions . Therefore , our findings suggest that growth factors like NT may be implicated in the early progression of pancreatic cancer by localized acidification and induction of an aerobic glycolytic phenotype with higher metastatic potential in small cell aggregates .	cellular energetics
20154149	It is crucial for organ homeostasis that epithelia have effective mechanisms to restrict motility and cell proliferation in order to maintain tissue architecture . On the other hand , epithelial cells need to rapidly and transiently acquire a more mesenchymal phenotype , with high levels of cell motility and proliferation , in order to repair epithelia upon injury . Cross talk between cell-cell and cell-matrix signaling is crucial for regulating these transitions . The Pak1-betaPIX-GIT complex is an effector complex downstream of the small GTPase Rac1 . We previously showed that translocation of this complex from cell-matrix to cell-cell adhesion sites was required for the establishment of contact inhibition of proliferation . In this study , we provide evidence that this translocation depends on cadherin function . Cadherins do not recruit the complex by direct interaction . Rather , we found that inhibition of the normal function of cadherin or Pak1 leads to defects in focal adhesion turnover and to increased signaling by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase . We propose that cadherins are involved in regulation of contact inhibition by controlling the function of the Pak1-betaPIX-GIT complex at focal contacts .	evading growth suppressors
20179302	Previous studies with selenium and/or vitamin E in prostate carcinogenesis animal models have been negative , but these models may not involve oxidative stress mechanisms . In this study , we examined the potential of selenomethionine and alpha-tocopherol to modulate prostate cancer development in the testosterone plus estradiol-treated NBL rat , a model that does involve sex hormone-induced oxidative stress mechanisms and prostatic inflammation . One week following the implantation with hormone-filled Silastic implants , rats were fed diets containing l-selenomethionine ( 1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg ) , DL-alpha-tocopherol acetate ( 2,000 or 4,000 mg/kg ) , or a natural ingredient control diet ( NIH-07 ) . The development of prostate carcinomas was not affected by dietary treatment with either agent . Food intake , body weight , and mortality were also not affected . The high dose of selenomethionine reduced the severity of epithelial dysplasia in the lateral prostate that was not associated with inflammation , and alpha-tocopherol reduced in a dose-related fashion the incidence of marked inflammation and marked epithelial dysplasia in the lateral prostate , regardless of whether these lesions were associated with inflammation. alpha-Tocopherol significantly increased the incidence of adenocarcinomas of the mammary glands at both dietary concentrations . Collectively , our findings suggest that selenomethionine and alpha-tocopherol supplementation does not prevent prostate cancer in rats fed diets with nutritionally adequate levels of selenium and vitamin E. Importantly , the results of the current animal studies and those reported previously were fully predictive of the outcome of the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial .	tumor promoting inflammation
20188144	BACKGROUND Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is associated with obesity , insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis . Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) is a serious consequence of NAFLD where chronic tissue damage and inflammation result in fibrosis which may progress to cirrhosis . Transforming growth factor beta1 ( TGFbeta1 ) , proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress are thought to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of these conditions . The contributions of individual liver cell types to fibrogenesis remain controversial and the influence of selenium status has not been investigated . METHODS In this study we have used a cell culture model of fat-loading using oleate-treated human hepatoblastoma ( C3A ) cells to investigate how fat-loading and selenium status might influence the production of collagen in response to TGFbeta1 . The secretion of inflammatory cytokines was also investigated , together with the epithelial character of the treated cells . RESULTS We found that in response to treatment with TGFbeta1 , C3A cells produced mRNA encoding the pro-alphaI chain of procollagen I , secreted procollagen I peptide , up-regulated production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) and the mesenchymal marker vimentin , and down-regulated albumin production . Most of these responses were considerably enhanced when cells were fat-loaded with oleate and were attenuated by selenium addition at a dose that optimised the expression of thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase . CONCLUSIONS Our data establish that both fat-loading and suboptimal selenium status enhance collagen and IL-8 production by C3A hepatocytes in response to TGFbeta1 , possibly as part of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition . GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE These findings suggest that the hepatocyte may be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of fibrosis associated with NAFLD .	tumor promoting inflammation
20199942	BACKGROUND Inactivation of p53 is involved in arsenite-induced tumorigenesis ; however , the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood . OBJECTIVE We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the inactivation of p53 and neoplastic transformation induced by arsenite in human embryo lung fibroblast ( HELF ) cells . METHODS Anchorage-independent growth assays were performed , and tumorigenicity in intact animals was assessed to confirm arsenite-induced neoplastic transformation . We determined the levels and functions of p53 , nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-B ; a key transcriptional regulator ) , and mot-2 ( a p53 inhibitor ) and their relationships in arsenite-induced transformed HELF cells by two-dimensional electrophoresis , reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction , Western blot , immunofluorescence , and co-immunoprecipitation assays . RESULTS Exposure of HELF cells to low levels of arsenite increased their proliferation rate and anchorage-independent growth and disrupted normal contact inhibition . When introduced into nude mice , transformed cells were tumorigenic . We used proteomic analysis to identify proteins with altered expression between untreated and arsenite-exposed cells . We found decreased expression of NF-B repressing factor ( NKRF ; an inhibitor of NF-B-mediated gene transcription ) , increased expression of mot-2 , and increased activation of NF-B . Changes in cells exposed to 1.0 microM arsenite were more marked than changes in cells exposed to 0.5 or 2.0 microM arsenite . Inactivation of NF-B prevented malignant transformation induced by 1.0 microM arsenite . Moreover , we also identified a mechanism whereby NF-B regulated p53 . Specifically , activation of NF-B up-regulated mot-2 expression , which prevented nuclear translocation of p53 and switched the binding preference of the p53 and NF-B coactivator CBP [ cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) binding protein ] from p53 to NF-B . CONCLUSIONS mot-2-mediated cross talk between NF-B and p53 appears to be involved in arsenite-induced tumorigenesis of HELF cells .	evading growth suppressors
20204879	DNA double strand breaks ( DSBs ) arise from spontaneous DNA damage due to metabolic activities or from direct and indirect damaging effects of stress . DSBs are also formed transiently during such processes as replication , transcription , and DNA repair . The level of DSBs positively correlates with the activities of homologous and nonhomologous DNA repair pathways , which in turn inversely correlate with methylation levels and chromatin structure . Thus , measurement of strand breaks can provide an informative picture of genome stability of a given cell . The use of random oligonucleotide-primed synthesis for the analysis of DSB levels is described . Applications of the assay for quantitative detection of 3'OH , 3'P , or DNA strand breaks at a cleavage site of the deoxyribose residue are discussed .	genomic instability and mutation
20210607	Although the immunomodulatory effects of many herbs have been extensively studied , research related to possible immunomodulatory effects of various spices is relatively scarce . Here , the potential immunomodulatory effects of black pepper and cardamom are investigated . Our data show that black pepper and cardamom aqueous extracts significantly enhance splenocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent , synergistic fashion . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments reveal that black pepper and cardamom significantly enhance and suppress , respectively , T helper ( Th)1 cytokine release by splenocytes . Conversely , Th2 cytokine release by splenocytes is significantly suppressed and enhanced by black pepper and cardamom , respectively . Experimental evidence suggests that black pepper and cardamom extracts exert pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory roles , respectively . Consistently , nitric oxide production by macrophages is significantly augmented and reduced by black pepper and cardamom , respectively . Remarkably , it is evident that black pepper and cardamom extracts significantly enhance the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells , indicating their potential anti-cancer effects . Our findings strongly suggest that black pepper and cardamom exert immunomodulatory roles and antitumor activities , and hence they manifest themselves as natural agents that can promote the maintenance of a healthy immune system . We anticipate that black pepper and cardamom constituents can be used as potential therapeutic tools to regulate inflammatory responses and prevent/attenuate carcinogenesis .	tumor promoting inflammation
20219441	1-(3-C-ethynyl-beta-d-ribo-pentofuranosyl)cytosine ( ECyd ) is a ribose-modified nucleoside analog of cytidine with potent anticancer activity in several cancers . The main antitumor mechanism of this promising RNA-directed nucleoside anti-metabolite is efficient blockade of RNA synthesis in cancer cells . Here , we examined the therapeutic potential of this RNA-directed anti-metabolite in in vitro models of nasopharyngeal cancer ( NPC ) . In a panel of 6 NPC cell lines , ECyd effectively inhibited cellular proliferation at nM concentrations ( IC(50) : approximately 13-44nM ) . Moreover , cisplatin-resistant NPC cells were highly sensitive to ECyd ( at nM concentration ) . The ECyd-mediated growth inhibition was associated with G(2)/M cell cycle arrest , PARP cleavage ( a hallmark of apoptosis ) and Bcl-2 downregulation , indicating induction of apoptosis by ECyd in NPC cells . Unexpectedly , ECyd-induced significant downregulation of TIGAR , a newly described dual regulator of apoptosis and glycolysis . More importantly , this novel action of ECyd on TIGAR was accompanied by marked depletion of NADPH , the major reducing power critically required for cell proliferation and survival . We hypothesized that ECyd-induced TIGAR downregulation was crucially involved in the antitumor activity of ECyd . Indeed , overexpression of TIGAR was able to rescue NPC cells from ECyd-induced growth inhibition , demonstrating a novel mechanistic action of ECyd on TIGAR . We demonstrated for the first time that an RNA-directed nucleoside analog , ECyd , exerts its antitumor activity via downregulation of a novel regulator of apoptosis , TIGAR . Moreover , ECyd may represent a novel therapy for NPC .	resisting cell death;cellular energetics
20299756	Ovarian smooth muscle tumors are a very rare type of ovarian tumor . In this paper , we report the case of a 62-year-old woman who had a huge smooth muscle tumor of the right ovary . The values of all the serum tumor markers were within normal limit . The tumor measured 25 cm in diameter and weighed 6,200 g . Histological examination revealed that coagulative cellular atypia was moderate to severe , necrosis was not present and mitotic index was low . According to the criteria for the evaluation of the uterine smooth muscle tumors , this huge tumor was diagnosed as atypical leiomyoma . However , we finally made a diagnosis of this tumor as a smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant potential ( STUMP ) because of its huge size . Further information is required regarding the characteristics of ovarian smooth muscle tumor and the propriety to introduce uterine tumor histological criteria to ovarian tumors .	resisting cell death
20303211	OBJECTIVE Ovarian carcinomas mostly appear as large cystic masses . However , the exact prevalence of cysts in epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) has never been documented as well as the tumor factors that are related to the presence of cysts . Demonstrating the prevalence of cysts in EOC is essential for research focused on predictive and prognostic biomarkers in ovarian cyst fluid . STUDY DESIGN From 233 patients with primary EOC who underwent surgery , pathological data were collected from pathology reports . Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the relationship between the presence of cysts and other tumor characteristics . RESULTS Cysts in EOC were present in 83.7% of the patients and were mostly ( 61% ) multilocular . The most common histological subtypes ( serous , mucinous , endometrioid , clear cell ) contained cysts in more than 85% of the cases . In univariate regression analysis , early FIGO stage , low tumor grade and a large tumor size were significantly associated with the presence of cysts ( OR ( 95% CI)=5.312 ( 1.81-15.57 ) , 6.906 ( 2.31-20.66 ) and 1.169 ( 1.08-1.27 ) , respectively ) . In multivariate regression analysis , apart from tumor size , only tumor grade was independently associated with the presence of cysts ( adjusted OR ( 95% CI)=4.234 ( 1.36-13.22) ) . CONCLUSIONS The large majority of all EOCs contained cysts . Histological subtype , FIGO stage , tumor necrosis and age were not associated with the presence of cystic EOC . In contrast , tumor grade and tumor size were independently related to the presence of cystic EOC . This means that cystic EOCs represent a subgroup of larger and more well-differentiated tumors . The evident relationship between the presence of cysts and differentiation grade is interesting from a clinical point of view as grading is especially important for the prognosis and treatment of patients with stage I EOC .	resisting cell death
20331620	Colon cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Western countries . Basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) was up-regulated in patients with colon cancer and was considered as a potential therapeutic target . In this study , we first demonstrated that a novel bFGF-binding peptide ( named P7 ) inhibited proliferation of several colon cancer cell lines including HT-29 , LoVo , and Caco2 cells stimulated by bFGF . Further investigations with HT-29 cells indicated that P7 arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase of bFGF-stimulated cells , reduced the levels of phospho-Erk1/Erk2 induced by bFGF , and caused significant changes in the expression of proteins related to proliferation , cell cycle , and cancer . Our results suggested that the bFGF-binding peptide has a potential antitumor effect on colon cancer .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20332618	In the present study , we investigated if the intracellular Cl(-) affects cell growth and cell cycle progression of androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3 cells . PC3 cells cultured in a medium containing 113 mM Cl(-) for 96 h grew up 9-fold in cell number , while PC3 cells cultured in an 8 mM-Cl(-)-containing culture medium showed complete arrest of cell growth even after culture for 96 h . Exposure of cells to the 8 mM-Cl(-) culture medium diminished phosphorylation levels of Rb and cdc2 , which are respectively key accelerators of transition from G(1) to S phase and G(2) to M phase in cell cycle progression . Culturing cells in the 8 mM-Cl(-)-containing culture medium upregulated the protein expression level of p21 ( a CDK inhibitor ) inhibiting transition of G(1) to S phase , and diminished the incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine ( EdU ; a thymidine analogue ) into DNA . These results suggest that cells cultured in the low Cl(-) medium prolonged the duration of all phases of the cell cycle ( G(1) , S , and G(2)/M ) , thereby abolishing overall cell cycle progression . Effects of culturing cells in the low Cl(-) culture medium on cell cycle progression would be mediated via a change in the intracellular Cl(-) concentration ( [ Cl(-)](i) ) , since [ Cl(-)](i) was decreased under a low Cl(-) culture medium . To clarify this possibility , we studied effects of furosemide and bumetanide , Na+/K+/2Cl(-) cotransporter ( NKCC ) inhibitors , on proliferation of PC3 cells . Furosemide and bumetanide decreased [ Cl(-)](i) and cell growth of PC3 cells . These results suggest that a change in [ Cl(-)](i) would play a critical role in this growth mechanism .	sustaining proliferative signaling;evading growth suppressors
20354164	Mouse models can be useful for increasing the understanding of lung tumorigenesis and assessing the potential of chemopreventive agents . We explored the role of inflammation in lung tumor development in mice with knockout of the tumor suppressor Gprc5a . Examination of normal lung tissue and tumors from 51 Gprc5a(+/+) ( adenoma incidence , 9.8% ; adenocarcinoma , 0% ) and 38 Gprc5a(-/-) mice ( adenoma , 63% ; adenocarcinoma , 21% ) revealed macrophage infiltration into lungs of 45% of the Gprc5a(-/-) mice and 8% of Gprc5a(+/+) mice and the direct association of macrophages with 42% of adenomas and 88% of adenocarcinomas in the knockout mice . Gprc5a(-/-) mouse lungs contained higher constitutive levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and were more sensitive than lungs of Gprc5a(+/+) mice to stimulation of NF-kappaB activation by lipopolysaccharide in vivo . Studies with epithelial cells cultured from tracheas of Gprc5a(-/-) and Gprc5a(+/+) mice revealed that Gprc5a loss is associated with increased cell proliferation , resistance to cell death in suspension , and increased basal , tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced , and lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappaB activation , which were reversed partially in Gprc5a(-/-) adenocarcinoma cells by reexpression of Gprc5a . Compared with Gprc5a(+/+) cells , the Gprc5a(-/-) cells produced higher levels of chemokines and cytokines and their conditioned medium induced more extensive macrophage migration . Silencing Gprc5a and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB in Gprc5a(+/+) and Gprc5a(-/-) cells , respectively , reversed these effects . Thus , Gprc5a loss enhances NF-kappaB activation in lung epithelial cells , leading to increased autocrine and paracrine interactions , cell autonomy , and enhanced inflammation , which may synergize in the creation of a tumor-promoting microenvironment .	tumor promoting inflammation
20357518	Treatment for glioblastoma multiforme includes the alkylating agent temozolomide combined with ionizing radiation . Persistent O6-guanine methylation by temozolomide in O6-methylguanine methyl transferase negative tumors causes cytotoxic lesions recognized by DNA mismatch repair , triggering apoptosis . Resistance ( intrinsic or acquired ) presents obstacles to successful temozolomide treatment , limiting drug efficacy and life expectancy . Two glioma cell lines , SNB19 and U373 , sensitive to temozolomide ( GI(50) values 36 and 68 microM , respectively ) were exposed to increasing temozolomide concentrations ( 1-100 microM ) . Variant cell lines ( SNB19VR , U373VR ) were generated that displayed acquired temozolomide resistance ( GI(50) values 280 and 289 microM , respectively ) . Cross-resistance to mitozolomide was observed in U373VR cells only . In clonogenic and MTT assays , methylguanine methyltransferase ( MGMT ) depletion using O6-benzylguanine sensitized U373VR cells to temozolomide , indicating the resistance mechanism involves MGMT re-expression . Indeed , Western blot analyses revealed MGMT protein in cell lysates . In SNB19VR cells , down-regulation of MSH6 message and protein expression may confer temozolomide tolerance . Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( a key base excision repair ( BER ) enzyme ) partially restored sensitivity , and DNA repair gene arrays demonstrated up-regulation ( &gt;5-fold ) of BER gene NTL1 in SNB19VR cells . In conclusion , we have developed two glioma cell lines whose distinct mechanisms of acquired resistance to temozolomide , involving expression of MGMT , or inactivation of DNA mismatch repair and recruitment of BER enzymes , are consistent with clinical observations . These cell lines provide valuable models for the development of strategies to combat temozolomide resistance .	genomic instability and mutation
20377132	MG132 , as a proteasome inhibitor , can induce apoptotic cell death through formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . In this study , we investigated the effects of MAPK ( MEK , JNK , and p38 ) inhibitors on MG132-treated A549 lung cancer cells in relation to cell growth , cell death , ROS , and glutathione ( GSH ) levels . Treatment with 10 microM MG132 inhibited the growth of A549 cells at 24 h . MG132 also induced apoptosis , which was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP ; deltapsi(m) ) . ROS were not increased in MG132-treated A549 cells . MG132 increased GSH-depleted cell numbers and decreased GSH levels . MEK and JNK inhibitors did not strongly affect cell growth , cell death , ROS , and GSH levels in MG132-treated A549 cells . In contrast , p38 inhibitor reduced cell growth inhibition , apoptosis , and MMP ( deltapsi(m) ) loss by MG132 . However , p38 inhibitor did not change ROS level and GSH content . In conclusion , MG132 inhibited the growth of A549 cells via apoptosis without formation of ROS . Treatment with p38 inhibitor rescued some cells from MG132-induced apotposis , which was not affected by ROS and GSH level changes .	resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling
20393017	A novel camptothecin derivative ( TLC388 ) with higher efficacy and reduced toxicity has been synthesized and tested as a novel chemoradiosensitizing agent . This study investigated the mechanisms of the chemoradiosensitizing effects of TLC388 on H23 human non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells . Using the TUNEL assay , a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic cells was observed in the group treated with TLC388 plus X-ray radiation than those in groups treated with drug or radiation alone . The sensitizer enhancement ratio ( SER ) was 1.91 . Apoptosis increased with drug concentration and radiation dose , exhibiting dose-dependent pattern . The results suggested that apoptosis could be a main mode of cell death that might underlie the increased chemoradio-sensitization of TLC388 . Treatment with 30 nM of TLC388 plus 4 Gy X-ray also produced up to 42% of necrotic cells that were measured by trypan blue exclusion assay , but with TLC388 alone or 4 Gy radiation alone 9.8% or 11.1% necrotic cells were detected , respectively . An immunofluorescent staining method was employed to determine the levels of gamma-H2AX ( phosphorylated H2AX , a variant of the H2A protein family , which is a component of the histone octomer in nucleosomes and is phosphorylated by kinases like ATM and ATR in the PI3K pathway , as the first step in recruiting and localizing DNA repair proteins ) as a molecular biomarker of DNA double strand breaks ( DSBs ) in cells treated with TLC388 +/-radiation , or radiation alone . The formation of gamma-H2AX foci was observed after TLC388 or radiation exposure and when the cells were treated with 30 nM TLC388 plus radiation at a dose of 2 Gy , the percentage of cells containing gamma-H2AX foci increased significantly . Even more interesting , a markedly higher percentage ( 65.4% ) of mitotic cells displayed gamma-H2AX foci after treatment with 30 nM TLC388 plus 0.5 Gy radiation , compared to only 5.9% or 26.1% of the M-phase cells treated with 30 nM TLC388 alone or 0.5 Gy radiation alone , respectively . It is suggested that mitotic cells become very sensitive to the production of DSBs after TLC388-radiation combined treatment and the formation of DSBs is strongly suggested to lead to the induction of apoptosis at doses lower than 4 Gy and to some necrosis at doses of 4 Gy or above . TLC388 enhances the production of DSBs and inhibits their repair , which contributes to the elucidation of the mechanisms of chemoradiosensitization of TLC388 and its development as a novel chemoradiosensitizing drug for improved radiotherapy .	resisting cell death;genomic instability and mutation
20395120	The hypoxic tumor microenvironment is associated with malignant progression and poor treatment response . The glucose transporter Glut-1 is a prognostic factor and putative hypoxia marker . So far , studies of Glut-1 in cancer have utilized conventional immunohistochemical analysis in a series of individual biopsy or surgical specimens . Tissue microarrays , however , provide a rapid , inexpensive means of profiling biomarker expression . To evaluate hypoxia markers , tissue cores must show the architectural features of hypoxia ; i.e. viable tissue surrounding necrotic regions . Glut-1 may be a useful biomarker to validate tissue microarrays for use in studies of hypoxia-regulated genes in cancer . In this study , we carried out immunohistochemical detection of Glut-1 protein in many tumor and normal tissue types in a range of tissue microarrays . Glut-1 was frequently found in peri-necrotic regions , occurring in 9/34 lymphomas , 6/12 melanomas , and 5/16 glioblastomas ; and in 43/54 lung , 22/84 colon , and 23/60 ovarian tumors . Expression was rare in breast ( 6/40 ) and prostate ( 1/57 ) tumors , and in normal tissue , was restricted to spleen , tongue , and CNS endothelium . In conclusion , tissue microarrays enable the observation of Glut-1 expression in peri-necrotic regions , which may be linked to hypoxia , and reflect previous studies showing differential Glut-1 expression across tumor types and non-malignant tissue .	resisting cell death
20414008	OBJECTIVE Although downregulation of neural cell adhesion molecule ( NCAM ) has been correlated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , it is also possible that colon cancer spreading comes from reducing tumor cell adhesion through NCAM polysialylation , as occurs in lung carcinoma or Wilms ' tumor . METHODS To prove this hypothesis , we have performed a prospective study on tumor and control specimens from 39 CRC patients , which were immunostained for NCAM and PSA ( polysialic acid ) expression . RESULTS Tumor versus control expression of NCAM and PSA epitopes in tissue specimens , as well as correlation between tumor expression and clinicopathological features , were statistically analyzed . Results showed a low constitutive expression of NCAM and PSA ( PSA-NCAM ) in control tissue , which reached a statistically significant increase in the tumor tissue . Likewise , the presence and number of lymph node metastases at surgery were correlated with NCAM expression and PSA/NCAM coexpression . CONCLUSIONS These data highlight the importance of taking into account PSA-associated epitopes when dealing with NCAM cell expression studies in tumor development and progression . The analysis of PSA and NCAM expression in CRC suggests a new way , other than downregulation of NCAM , in order to escape contact inhibition and promote cell tumor spreading in colorectal cancer .	evading growth suppressors
20494629	In order to increase the permeability of cell membranes for low doses of cytostatic drugs , two bioelectrochemical methods have been compared : ( a ) electric pore formation in the plasma membranes by single electric impulses ( electroporation ) , and ( b ) reordering of membrane structure by alternating currents ( capacitively coupled ) . These treatments were applied to human leukemic K-562 cells and human lymphoma U-937 cells , yielding apoptotic and necrotic effects , determined by flow cytometry . Additional cell death occurs after exposure to light irradiation at wavelengths lambda &gt ; 600 nm , of cells which were electroporated and had incorporated actinomycin-C or daunomycin ( daunorubicin ) . It is observed that drug uptake after an exponentially decaying electroporation pulse of the initial field strength Eo=1.4 kV/cm and pulse time constants in the time range 0.5-3 ms is faster than during PEMF-treatment , i.e. , application of an alternating current of 16 kHz , voltage U&lt;100 V , I=55 mA , and exposure time 20 min . However , at the low a.c. voltage of this treatment , more apoptotic and necrotic cells are produced as compared to the electroporation treatment with one exponentially decaying voltage pulse . Thus , additional photodynamic action appears to be more effective than solely drugs and electroporation as applied in clinical electrochemotherapy , and more effective than the noninvasive pulsed electromagnetic fields ( PEMFs ) , for cancer cells in general and animals bearing tumors in particular .	resisting cell death
20507318	Tumor aerobic glycolysis , or the Warburg effect , plays important roles in tumor survival , growth , and metastasis . Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 ( PKM2 ) is a key enzyme that regulates aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells . Recent research has shown that PKM2 can be used as a tumor marker for diagnosis and , in particular , as a potential target for cancer therapy . We investigated the effects of combining shRNA targeting PKM2 and docetaxel on human A549 lung carcinoma cells both in vivo and in vitro . We observed that the shRNA can significantly downregulate the expression level of PKM2 . The decrease of PKM2 resulted in a decrease in ATP synthesis , which caused intracellular accumulation of docetaxel . Furthermore , the combination of pshRNA-pkm2 and docetaxel inhibited tumor growth and promoted more cancer cell apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro . Our findings suggest that targeting tumor glycolysis can increase the efficacy of chemotherapy . In particular , the targeting of PKM2 could , to some extent , be a new way of reversing chemotherapy resistance to cancer therapy .	cellular energetics
20519814	A 33-year-old man presented with pain and palsy of the leg in 2008 for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with huge distant metastases . The patient's tumors had slowly enlarged despite several treatments . Oral administration of sorafenib at 800 mg/day with careful observation was commenced in 2009 . Laboratory investigations on day 7 showed massive tumor lysis . An abdominal CT showed multiple low density areas and tumor markers decreased , indicating extended tumor necrosis . In conclusion , clinicians should bear in mind not only the published adverse effects , but also massive tumor lysis , when treating patients with large tumor burden by sorafenib .	resisting cell death
20519932	"Cav-1 ( -/- ) deficient stromal cells are a new genetic model for myofibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts . Using an unbiased informatics analysis of the transcriptional profile of Cav-1 ( -/- ) deficient mesenchymal stromal cells , we have now identified many of the major signaling pathways that are activated by a loss of Cav-1 , under conditions of metabolic restriction ( with low glucose media ) . Our informatics analysis suggests that a loss of Cav-1 induces oxidative stress , which mimics a constitutive pseudo-hypoxic state , leading to ( 1 ) aerobic glycolysis and ( 2 ) inflammation in the tumor stromal microenvironment . This occurs via the activation of two major transcription factors , namely HIF ( aerobic glycolysis ) and NFÎºB ( inflammation ) in Cav-1 ( -/- ) stromal fibroblastic cells . Experimentally , we show that Cav-1 deficient stromal cells may possess defective mitochondria , due to the over-production of nitric oxide ( NO ) , resulting in the tyrosine nitration of the mitochondrial respiratory chain components ( such as complex I ) . Elevated levels of nitro-tyrosine were observed both in Cav-1 ( -/- ) stromal cells , and via acute knock-down with siRNA targeting Cav-1 . Finally , metabolic restriction with mitochondrial ( complex I ) and glycolysis inhibitors was synthetically lethal with a Cav-1 ( -/- ) deficiency in mice . As such , Cav-1 deficient mice show a dramatically reduced mitochondrial reserve capacity . Thus , a mitochondrial defect in Cav-1 deficient stromal cells could drive oxidative stress , leading to aerobic glycolysis , and inflammation , in the tumor microenvironment . These stromal alterations may underlie the molecular basis of the "" reverse Warburg effect "" , and could provide the key to targeted anti-cancer therapies using metabolic inhibitors . In direct support of these findings , the transcriptional profile of Cav-1 ( -/- ) stromal cells overlaps significantly with Alzheimer disease , which is characterized by oxidative stress , NO over-production ( peroxynitrite formation ) , inflammation , hypoxia and mitochondrial dysfunction . We conclude that Cav-1 ( -/- ) deficient mice are a new whole-body animal model for an activated lethal tumor microenvironment , i.e. , "" tumor stroma "" without the tumor . Since Cav-1 ( -/- ) mice are also an established animal model for profibrotic disease , our current results may have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of scleroderma ( systemic sclerosis ) and pulmonary fibrosis , which are also related to abnormal mesenchymal stem cell function ."	tumor promoting inflammation;cellular energetics
20522955	Overexpression/amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER)2/neu ( erbB-2 ) oncogene plays a causal role in carcinogenesis and correlates with a poor clinical prognosis . However , little is known about HER2 in gastric cancer . In this study , we explored the pharmacological activities of natural triterpenoid corosolic acid ( CRA ) in HER2 signaling and its role in gastric cancer development and progression . In this study , CRA dramatically inhibited HER2 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner , effectively inhibited cell proliferation , and induced G(0)/G(1) arrest through the induction of p27(kip1) and cyclin D(1) down-regulation . CRA exposure enhanced apoptotic cell death , as confirmed by caspase-3 and poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase cleavage activities . CRA inhibited signaling pathways downstream of HER2 , including phospho-proteins such as Akt and Erk . In addition , CRA combined with adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil enhanced this growth inhibition , but not with docetaxel and paclitaxel . These findings demonstrate that CRA suppresses HER2 expression , which in turn promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death of gastric cancer cells , providing a rationale for future clinical trials of CRA in the treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancers .	evading growth suppressors;sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death
20525379	INTRODUCTION Anterior-gradient 2 ( AGR2 ) is an estrogen-responsive secreted protein . Its upregulation has been well documented in a number of cancers , particularly breast cancer , for which mixed data exist on the prognostic implications of AGR2 expression . Although emerging evidence indicates that AGR2 is associated with poor prognosis , its function and impact on cancer-relevant pathways have not been elucidated in breast cancer . METHODS To investigate the biologic role of AGR2 in breast cancer , AGR2 was transiently knocked down , by using siRNA , in T47 D and ZR-75-1 ( estrogen receptor-alpha ( ER)-positive ) and MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 ( ER-negative ) human breast cancer cell lines . The impact of silencing AGR2 was evaluated in both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth ( soft agar , spheroid ) assays . Cell-cycle profiles in ER-positive cell lines were determined with BrdU incorporation , and cell death was measured with Annexin V , JC-1 , and F7-26 staining . After transiently silencing AGR2 or stimulating with recombinant AGR2 , modulation of key regulators of growth and survival pathways was assessed with Western blot . Combination studies of AGR2 knockdown with the antiestrogens tamoxifen and fulvestrant were carried out and assessed at the level of anchorage-dependent growth inhibition and target modulation ( cyclin D1 , ER ) . RESULTS AGR2 knockdown inhibited growth in anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent assays , with a more-pronounced effect in ER-positive cell lines . Cyclin D1 levels and BrdU incorporation were reduced with AGR2 knockdown . Conversely , cyclin D1 was induced with recombinant AGR2 . AGR2 knockdown induced cell death in ZR-75-1 and T47 D cells , and also downregulated survivin and c-Myc . Evidence of AGR2-ER crosstalk was demonstrated by a reduction of ER at the protein level after transiently silencing AGR2 . AGR2 knockdown in combination with fulvestrant or tamoxifen did not preclude the efficacy of the antiestrogens , but enhanced it . In addition , p-Src , implicated in tamoxifen resistance , was downregulated with AGR2 knockdown . CONCLUSIONS Transiently silencing AGR2 in ER-positive breast cancer cell lines inhibited cell growth and cell-cycle progression and induced cell death . Breast cancer drivers ( ER and cyclin D1 ) as well as cancer-signaling nodes ( pSrc , c-Myc , and survivin ) were demonstrated to be downstream of AGR2 . Collectively , the data presented support the utility of anti-AGR2 therapy in ER-positive breast cancers because of its impact on cancer-relevant pathways .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20539003	The deregulation of Met/hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) receptor tyrosine kinase signaling constitutes a common event in colorectal cancers . However , the physiopathological functions of such a deregulation remain poorly understood . In the present study , we investigated the role of the deregulation of Met receptor in the neoplastic transformation of intestinal epithelial cells . To do so , the normal , well-established and characterized rat intestinal epithelial IEC-6 cells were transduced with a retrovirus carrying the oncogenic constitutive active form of Met receptor , Tpr-Met . Herein , we show that compared with control IEC-6 cells , Tpr-Met-IEC-6 cells exhibit enhanced proliferation , loss of growth-contact inhibition , cell morphological alterations , actin cytoskeletal reorganization , loss of E-cadherin expression and anchorage-independent growth . Moreover , Tpr-Met-IEC-6 cells are conferred the capacity to produce the proangiogenic factor VEGF and to reduce the potent antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 . Of significance , Tpr-Met-IEC-6 cells are endowed with the ability to elicit angiogenic responses and to form tumors and metastases in vivo . Hence , our study demonstrates for the first time that the sole oncogenic engagement of Met receptor in normal intestinal epithelial cells is sufficient to induce a wide array of cancerous biological processes that are fundamental to the initiation and malignant progression of colorectal cancers .	evading growth suppressors;inducing angiogenesis
20573279	BACKGROUND The importance of cell-surface nucleolin in cancer biology was recently highlighted by studies showing that ligands of nucleolin play critical role in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis . By using a specific antagonist that binds the C-terminal tail of nucleolin , the HB-19 pseudopeptide , we recently reported that HB-19 treatment markedly suppressed the progression of established human breast tumor cell xenografts in the athymic nude mice without apparent toxicity . METHODS The in vivo antitumoral action of HB-19 treatment was assessed on the spontaneous development of melanoma in the RET transgenic mouse model . Ten days old RET mice were treated with HB-19 in a prophylactic setting that extended 300 days . In parallel , the molecular basis for the action of HB-19 was investigated on a melanoma cell line ( called TIII ) derived from a cutaneous nodule of a RET mouse . RESULTS HB-19 treatment of RET mice caused a significant delay in the onset of cutaneous tumors , several-months delay in the incidence of large tumors , a lower frequency of cutaneous nodules , and a reduction of visceral metastatic nodules while displaying no toxicity to normal tissue . Moreover , microvessel density was significantly reduced in tumors recovered from HB-19 treated mice compared to corresponding controls . Studies on the melanoma-derived tumor cells demonstrated that HB-19 treatment of TIII cells could restore contact inhibition , impair anchorage-independent growth , and reduce their tumorigenic potential in mice . Moreover , HB-19 treatment caused selective down regulation of transcripts coding matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 , and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the TIII cells and in melanoma tumors of RET mice . CONCLUSIONS Although HB-19 treatment failed to prevent the development of spontaneous melanoma in the RET mice , it delayed for several months the onset and frequency of cutaneous tumors , and exerted a significant inhibitory effect on visceral metastasis . Consequently , HB-19 could provide a novel therapeutic agent by itself or as an adjuvant therapy in association with current therapeutic interventions on a virulent cancer like melanoma .	inducing angiogenesis;evading growth suppressors;activating invasion and metastasis
20588279	BACKGROUND The incidence of ovarian cancer has been increasing worldwide and it is currently the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancy . Unlike breast cancer , the prognostic role of the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( HER-2 ) in ovarian carcinoma remains controversial . METHODS The aim of this preclinical study was to further characterise the biological , molecular and cellular effects of trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) using NIH-OVCAR-3 and derived cell lines both in vitro and in vivo . RESULTS In vitro assessments have shown that trastuzumab treatment inhibited total and phosphorylated HER-2 . This was associated with inhibition of the phosphorylated form of phosphatase and tensin homologue ( PTEN ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT , and the total level of p27(kip) . Inhibition of PTEN is associated with phosphorylated MEK1/2 upregulation , suggesting a specific inhibition of the protein phosphatase function of PTEN . Moreover , trastuzumab induced the upregulation of RhoB . These molecular modifications promote inhibition of cell migration and potentially restoration of tumour cell contact inhibition . RhoB induction in NIH-OVCAR-3 control cell lines mimics the molecular and cellular trastuzumab long-time exposition effects . RhoB inhibition in NIH-OVCAR-3 long-time exposed to trastuzumab cell line reverses the cellular and molecular effects observed in this model . In vivo examinations have shown that these changes are also associated with the restoration of structural , morphological and normal functions of the peritoneum of an ovarian carcinoma mouse model . CONCLUSION These results provide an indication of the mechanisms underlying the anti-tumour activity of trastuzumab that strongly implicate RhoB in an ovarian carcinoma model that does not show HER-2 amplification or overexpression . These findings highlight that trastuzumab effects involve a possible cross-talk between RhoB and PTEN in the early stages of tumour re-growth in a model of micrometastatic ovarian cancer .	sustaining proliferative signaling;evading growth suppressors
20594311	INTRODUCTION The HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir is currently under investigation as a new anti-cancer drug . Several studies have shown that nelfinavir induces cell cycle arrest , endoplasmic reticulum stress , autophagy , and apoptosis in cancer cells . In the present article , the effect of nelfinavir on human breast cancer cells is examined and potential combination treatments are investigated . METHODS The effects of nelfinavir and tamoxifen on the human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 , T47 D , MDA-MB-453 , and MDA-MB-435 were tested by analysing their influence on cell viability ( via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay ) , apoptosis ( annexin binding , poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage ) , autophagy ( autophagy marker light chain 3B expression ) , endoplasmic reticulum stress ( binding protein and activating transcription factor 3 expression ) , and the occurrence of oxidative stress ( intracellular glutathione level ) . RESULTS Nelfinavir induced apoptosis in all four breast cancer cell lines tested , although the extent of autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress varied among the cell lines . The concentration of nelfinavir needed for an efficient induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells could be reduced from 15 Î¼g/ml to 6 Î¼g/ml when combined with tamoxifen . At a concentration of 6 Î¼g/ml , tamoxifen substantially enhanced the endoplasmic reticulum stress reaction in those cell lines that responded to nelfinavir with binding protein ( BiP ) upregulation ( MCF7 , T47D ) , and enhanced autophagy in cell lines that responded to nelfinavir treatment with autophagy marker light chain 3B upregulation ( MDA-MB-453 ) . Although tamoxifen has been described to be able to induce oxidative stress at concentrations similar to those applied in this study ( 6 Î¼g/ml ) , we observed that nelfinavir but not tamoxifen reduced the intracellular glutathione level of breast cancer cells within hours of application by up to 32% , suggesting the induction of oxidative stress was an early event and an additional cause of the apoptosis induced by nelfinavir . CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrate that nelfinavir may be an effective drug against breast cancer and could be combined with tamoxifen to enhance its efficacy against breast cancer cells . Moreover , the cytotoxic effect of a tamoxifen and nelfinavir combination was independent of the oestrogen receptor status of the analysed breast cancer cells , suggesting a potential benefit of a combination of these two drugs even in patients with no hormone-responsive tumours . We therefore recommend that clinical studies on nelfinavir with breast cancer patients should include this drug combination to analyse the therapeutic efficacy as well as the safety and tolerability of this potential treatment option .	resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling
20619277	AIMS Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines in the kidney . Epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG ) has anti-oxidant , anti-inflammatory , and anti-tumorigenic properties . In this study , we investigated the effects of EGCG on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and potential mechanisms by which it enhances antioxidant activities and resolves inflammation after EGCG treatment during cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity . MAIN METHODS Twenty-eight rats were divided into four groups as control ( group 1 ; no treatment ; n=7 ) , EGCG ( group 2 ; n=7 ) , cisplatin ( group 3 ; n=7 ) or cisplatin and EGCG ( group 4 ; n=7 ) . After 2 days of EGCG treatment at a dose of l00 mg/kg BW , rats were treated with a single i.p. injection of cisplatin ( 7 mg/kg BW ) . On day 12 ( 10days after the cisplatin treatment ) , all rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation . The level of protein was examined by Western blotting . KEY FINDINGS Cisplatin caused a significant decrease in the expression nuclear levels of NF-E2-related factor-2 ( Nrf2 ) , heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) , and an increase in the levels of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB p65 ) and 4-hydroxynonenal ( HNE ) an oxidative stress marker . EGCG supplementation significantly improved the changes associated with cisplatin nephrotoxicity by increasing levels of Nrf-2 and HO-1 , and decreasing levels of NF-kappaB and HNE . Renal activities of antioxidant enzymes ( catalase , superoxide dismutase , glutathione peroxidase ) and glutathione were significantly lower in cisplatin-treated rats compared with control rats , and EGCG treatment significantly increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione ( P&lt;0.001 ) . SIGNIFICANCE The results suggest that Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway may be the primary target for prevention of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by EGCG , and that reduces it inflammation by inhibiting NF-kappaB .	tumor promoting inflammation
20632815	AIMS Currently , testing for mismatch repair deficiency in colorectal cancers is initiated by performing immunohistochemistry with four antibodies ( MLH1 , PMS2 , MSH2 and MSH6 ) . If any one of these stains is negative the tumour is considered microsatellite unstable and , if clinical circumstances warrant it , the patient is offered genetic testing for Lynch's syndrome . Due to the binding properties of the mismatch repair heterodimer complexes , gene mutation and loss of MLH1 and MSH2 invariably result in the degradation of PMS2 and MSH6 , respectively , but the converse is not true . We propose that staining for PMS2 and MSH6 alone will be sufficient to detect all cases of mismatch repair deficiency and should replace routine screening with all four antibodies . METHODS The electronic database of the department of Anatomical Pathology , Royal North Shore Hospital , Sydney , Australia , was searched for all colorectal carcinomas on which a four panel immunohistochemical microsatellite instability screen was performed . An audit of the slides for concordant loss of MLH1-PMS2 and MSH2-MSH6 was then undertaken . Unusual or discordant cases were reviewed and , in some cases , re-stained to confirm the staining pattern . RESULTS Of 344 cases of colorectal cancer which underwent four antibody immunohistochemistry , 104 displayed loss of at least one mismatch repair protein . Of these , 100 showed concordant mismatch repair loss ( i.e. , loss of MLH1 and PMS2 or loss of MSH2 and MSH6 ) . The four discordant cases comprised two single negative cases ( 1 MSH6 negative/MSH2 positive case , 1 PMS2 negative/MLH1 positive ) and two triple negative ( both MLH1/PMS2/MSH6 negative ) . The microsatellite instability ( MSI ) group showed a relatively high median age ( 69.3 years ) due to the departmental policy of testing all cases with possible MSI morphology regardless of age . CONCLUSIONS The sensitivity and specificity of a two panel test comprised of PMS2 and MSH6 , compared to a four panel test , is 100% . No false negatives or positives were identified . We conclude that the two panel test should replace a four panel protocol for immunohistochemical screening for mismatch repair deficiency .	genomic instability and mutation
20658731	PURPOSE Overproduction of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) intermediates above the functional capability of cellular antioxidants may result in instability of important macromolecules and represents the molecular basis of many diseases including inflammation processes , cardiovascular alterations , cancer etc . The purpose of this study was to determine plasma level of superoxide anion , hydrogen-peroxide and malondialdehyde ( MDA ) as markers of oxidative stress and activities of superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) and glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) as antioxidant enzymes in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) patients . METHODS The study included 29 untreated B-CLL patients in stage A , and 21 in stages B and C , classified according to the Binet system ; 31 healthy volunteers formed the control group . After centrifugation of heparinized peripheral blood , plasma levels of all investigated parameters were determined using spectrophotometric methods . RESULTS Plasma CAT activity was increased in B-CLL patients compared with control subjects ; also , progression of disease was related with significantly higher plasma activity of CAT . Also , B-CLL patients showed significantly higher plasma concentration of MDA compared with controls . No statistically significant differences of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide as well as plasma activity of SOD and GPx between the tested groups were noted . CONCLUSION Increase of CAT activity in B-CLL patients indicates that there is stimulation of the antioxidant enzyme system , while the increase of MDA concentration shows increased lipid peroxidation level . According to these results it could be concluded that an imbalance exists between oxidants and antioxidants in the plasma of B-CLL patients .	tumor promoting inflammation
20683149	The NOTCH signaling pathway plays important role in the development of multicellular organisms , as it regulates cell proliferation , survival , and differentiation . In adults , it is essential for the T- or B-lymphocyte lineage commitment . NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations both lead the activation of the NOTCH1 pathway and are found in the majority of T-ALL patients . In this study , the mutation analysis of NOTCH1 and FBXW7 genes was performed in 87 pediatric T-ALLs who were treated on the ALL-BFM protocols . In 19 patients ( 22% ) , activating NOTCH1 mutations were observed either in the heterodimerization domain or in the PEST domain and 7 cases ( 10% ) demonstrated FBXW7 mutations ( 2 cases had both NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations ) . We also analyzed the relationship of the mutation data between the clinical and biological data of the patients . NOTCH1 and FBXW7 , NOTCH1 alone were found correlated with lower initial leucocyte counts which was independent from the sex and T- cell immunophenotype . However , NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations were not predictive of outcome in the overall cohort of pediatric T-ALLs .	genomic instability and mutation
20693267	The authors examined nutritional risk factors for prostate cancer among 9,559 participants in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial ( United States and Canada , 1994-2003 ) . The presence or absence of cancer was determined by prostate biopsy , which was recommended during the trial because of an elevated prostate-specific antigen level or an abnormal digital rectal examination and was offered to all men at the trial's end . Nutrient intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and a structured supplement-use questionnaire . Cancer was detected in 1,703 men ; 127 cancers were high-grade ( Gleason score 8-10 ) . There were no associations of any nutrient or supplement with prostate cancer risk overall . Risk of high-grade cancer was associated with high intake of polyunsaturated fats ( quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 : odds ratio = 2.41 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.33 , 4.38 ) . Dietary calcium was positively associated with low-grade cancer but inversely associated with high-grade cancer ( for quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 , odds ratios were 1.27 ( 95% CI : 1.02 , 1.57 ) and 0.43 ( 95% CI : 0.21 , 0.89 ) , respectively ) . Neither dietary nor supplemental intakes of nutrients often suggested for prostate cancer prevention , including lycopene , long-chain n-3 fatty acids , vitamin D , vitamin E , and selenium , were significantly associated with cancer risk . High intake of n-6 fatty acids , through their effects on inflammation and oxidative stress , may increase prostate cancer risk .	tumor promoting inflammation
20699632	BACKGROUND/AIMS by reducing the number of ATP molecules produced via aerobic glycolysis , the inhibition of lactic dehydrogenase ( LDH ) should hinder the growth of neoplastic cells without damaging the normal cells which do not rely on this metabolic pathway for their energetic needs . Here , we studied the effect of oxamic and tartronic acids , 2 inhibitors of LDH , on aerobic glycolysis and cell replication of HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells , 2 lines from human hepatocellular carcinomas . METHODS aerobic glycolysis was measured by calculating the amounts of lactic acid formed . The effect on replication was assessed by culturing the cells in both standard conditions and glucose-deprived medium , which was used to shut down aerobic glycolysis . RESULTS the oxamic and tartronic acids inhibited aerobic glycolysis , impaired the growth of both cell lines and also induced an increased expression of p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis , a signal of cell death . A strong impairment of cell replication by oxamic acid was only found when the cells were cultured in the presence of glucose , indicating that it was for the most part owing to inhibition of aerobic glycolysis . CONCLUSIONS inhibition of aerobic glycolysis achieved by blocking LDH could be useful in the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinomas . Without interfering with glucose metabolism in normal cells , it could hinder cell growth by itself and could also enhance the chemotherapeutic index of associated anticancer agents by decreasing the levels of ATP selectively in neoplastic cells .	cellular energetics
20714148	BACKGROUND Current treatments have a modest impact on survival of pancreatic cancer patients and this study investigates the interaction between sorafenib and gemcitabine and the molecular pharmacodynamics of this combination . METHODS The pancreatic cancer cells were treated with sorafenib and gemcitabine , alone or in combination . The effects of treatments were evaluated on cell proliferation , cell cycle , apoptosis , phosphorylation of Akt , c-Kit , ERK and VEGFR2 , and expression of genes related to drug activity . RESULTS Gemcitabine and sorafenib synergistically interacted on the inhibition of cell proliferation , and assessment of apoptosis demonstrated that drug associations increased the apoptotic index . Sorafenib reduced c-Kit , ERK and VEGFR2 activation and on the other hand , gemcitabine inhibited Akt phosphorylation . Moreover , quantitative PCR showed that sorafenib modulated the expression of genes related to gemcitabine activity , while gemcitabine induced the expression of RKIP . CONCLUSION These data demonstrate that gemcitabine and sorafenib combination displays a synergistic effect in pancreatic cancer cells .	resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling
20734923	Evidence suggests that stem-like cells are responsible for initiation , maintenance and recurrence of solid tumors , including Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM ) . GBM is an intractable , highly lethal tumor of the central nervous system . Although epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is highly expressed in many GBMs , anti-EGFR therapies have been unsuccessful as treatment . Few studies have examined EGFR activation in GBM stem cells ( GSCs ) to determine if patient-specific GSCs are amenable to anti-EGFR therapy pre-clinically . We hypothesized that EGFR activation in GSCs varied between patients and was an important determinant of responsiveness to anti-EGFR therapy . Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis was performed on tumor-spheres by immuncytochemistry in the presence and absence of the AG1478 . Second messenger pathways operative in these processes were elucidated by immunoblotting . EGFR activated AKT and inactivated GSK3beta in EGFR+/PTEN+ GSCs . AG1478 and erlotinib significantly decreased the total number of tumor-spheres that EGFR+/ PTEN+ GSCs generated and the rate of sphere formation . Inhibition of EGFR signaling by AG1478 increased GSC senescence and apoptosis , likely via inhibition of AKT and activation of GSK3beta . Sphere formation by EGFR-/ PTEN- GSCs was independent of EGF stimulation , but dependant on B27 growth supplement . Our data suggest that EGFR+/PTEN+ GSCs are susceptible to anti-EGFR therapy in vitro .	enabling replicative immortality;resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling
20810208	"The NF-ÎºB is best known for its role in inflammation . Here we show that constitutive NF-ÎºB activity in cancer cells promotes the biosynthesis of redox scavenger glutathione ( GSH ) , which in turn confers resistance to oxidative stress . Inhibition of NF-ÎºB significantly decreases GSH in several lines of human leukemia and prostate cancer cells possessing high or moderate NF-ÎºB activities . Concomitantly , NF-ÎºB inhibition by pharmacological and molecular means sensitizes "" NF-ÎºB positive "" cancer cells to chemically-induced oxidative stress and death . We propose that inhibition of NF-ÎºB can reduce intracellular GSH in "" NF-ÎºB-positive "" cancers thereby improving the efficacy of oxidative stress-based anti-cancer therapy ."	tumor promoting inflammation
20819511	BACKGROUND Oxidative stress and inflammation are important steps in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis . We postulated that therapeutic concentrations of aspirin and pravastatin , especially in combination , may suppress oxidative stress and inflammation in endothelial cells , and this concept was examined in human coronary artery endothelial cells ( HCAECs ) . METHODS Human coronary artery endothelial cells were cultured and treated with oxidized-low density lipoprotein ( ox-LDL , 60 microg/ml for 24 hours ) alone , or pre-treated with aspirin ( 1 , 2 or 5 mmol/L ) , pravastatin ( 1 , 5 or 10 micromol/L ) or their combination ( 1 mmol/L aspirin and 5 micromol/L pravastatin ) , followed by ox-LDL treatment . After respective treatment , superoxide anion production , p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and transcription factor NF-kappaB activation , protein expression of lectin-like ox-LDL receptor-1 ( LOX-1 ) and adhesion molecules , and monocyte adhesion were measured . RESULTS Ox-LDL treatment greatly elicited its receptor LOX-1 expression , superoxide anion production and inflammatory response , which were minimally affected by low concentration of aspirin ( 1 mmol/L ) or pravastatin ( 5 micromol/L ) , but were markedly decreased by their combination . Activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and NF-kappaB , the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , which were only mildly affected by aspirin or pravastatin alone , were significantly attenuated by their combination . As a consequence , monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells was markedly attenuated by the combination of the two agents . Well-known anti-oxidants alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol had similar inhibitory effects on ox-LDL-mediated oxidative stress and LOX-1 expression as well as monocyte adhesion as did the combination of aspirin and pravastatin . CONCLUSIONS These studies point to a positive interaction between aspirin and pravastatin with regard to endothelial biology . Anti-oxidant and subsequent anti-inflammatory effect may be one of the potential underling mechanisms .	tumor promoting inflammation
20823571	Application of adenovirus vectors ( Adv ) in metastatic cancer treatment is limited . We previously demonstrated that covalent conjugation of polyethleneglycol ( PEG ) to Adv enhances therapeutic effects and decreases toxic side-effects after systemic administration , but the level of immune response to PEGylated Adv ( PEG-Ad ) was not examined . Here , we examined the effect of PEGylation of Adv on the production of anti-Adv antibodies and antitumor response . We constructed a set of PEG-Ad using 5-kDa PEG , with modification rates of 30% , 45% and 90% . After systemic administration of Advs to rats , we examined the level of anti-Adv immunoglobulin ( Ig)G and IgM in serum . The levels of anti-Adv IgG and anti-Adv IgM in rats treated with unmodified Adv were higher than those in control group . Rats treated with PEG-Ad that had a 90% modification rate showed lower level of anti-Adv IgG and anti-Adv IgM than those treated with unmodified Adv , whereas rats treated with PEG-Ad that had a 30% or 45% modification rate showed a similar level of anti-Adv IgG and IgM to those treated with unmodified Adv. Systemic administration of PEG-Ad that had a 90% modification rate , and expressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha , significantly reduced the number of metastatic colonies in the lung compared to unmodified Adv , with negligible side effects . These results suggest that systemic administration of PEG-Ad with an appropriate PEG modification rate has the potential to reduce the production of antibodies against Adv and increase the therapeutic response against metastatic cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis;tumor promoting inflammation
20824135	BACKGROUND Advancing age is associated with substantial increases in the incidence rates of common diseases affecting the prostate gland including benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) and prostate carcinoma . The prostate is comprised of a functional secretory epithelium , a basal epithelium , and a supporting stroma comprised of structural elements , and a spectrum of cell types that includes smooth muscle cells , fibroblasts , and inflammatory cells . As reciprocal interactions between epithelium and stromal constituents are essential for normal organogenesis and serve to maintain normal functions , discordance within the stroma could permit or promote disease processes . In this study we sought to identify aging-associated alterations in the mouse prostate microenvironment that could influence pathology . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We quantitated transcript levels in microdissected glandular-adjacent stroma from young ( age 4 months ) and old ( age 20-24 months ) C57BL/6 mice , and identified a significant change in the expression of 1259 genes ( p&lt;0.05 ) . These included increases in transcripts encoding proteins associated with inflammation ( e.g. , Ccl8 , Ccl12 ) , genotoxic/oxidative stress ( e.g. , Apod , Serpinb5 ) and other paracrine-acting effects ( e.g. , Cyr61 ) . The expression of several collagen genes ( e.g. , Col1a1 and Col3a1 ) exhibited age-associated declines . By histology , immunofluorescence , and electron microscopy we determined that the collagen matrix is abundant and disorganized , smooth muscle cell orientation is disordered , and inflammatory infiltrates are significantly increased , and are comprised of macrophages , T cells and , to a lesser extent , B cells . CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE These findings demonstrate that during normal aging the prostate stroma exhibits phenotypic and molecular characteristics plausibly contributing to the striking age associated pathologies affecting the prostate .	tumor promoting inflammation
20852630	The AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun is essential for cellular proliferation in many cell types , but the molecular link between growth factors and c-Jun activation has been enigmatic . In this study we identify a previously uncharacterized RING-domain-containing protein , RACO-1 ( RING domain AP-1 co-activator-1 ) , as a c-Jun co-activator that is regulated by growth factor signalling . RACO-1 interacted with c-Jun independently of amino-terminal phosphorylation , and was both necessary and sufficient for c-Jun/AP-1 activation . Growth factor-mediated stimulation of AP-1 was attributable to MEK/ERK-dependent stabilization of RACO-1 protein . Stimulation of the MEK/ERK pathway strongly promoted Lys 63-linked ubiquitylation of RACO-1 , which antagonized Lys 48-linked degradative auto-ubiquitylation of the same Lys residues . RACO-1 depletion reduced cellular proliferation and decreased expression of several growth-associated AP-1 target genes , such as cdc2 , cyclinD1 and hb-egf . Moreover , transgenic overexpression of RACO-1 augmented intestinal tumour formation triggered by aberrant Wnt signalling and cooperated with oncogenic Ras in colonic hyperproliferation . Thus RACO-1 is a co-activator that links c-Jun to growth factor signalling and is essential for AP-1 function in proliferation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20863366	INTRODUCTION IÎºB Kinase Îµ ( IKKÎµ ) is a member of the IKK family which plays an important role in the activation of nuclear factor-ÎºB ( NF-ÎºB ) . Overexpressed in over 30% of breast cancers , IKKÎµ has been recently identified as a potential breast cancer oncogene . The purpose of this study is to examine the therapeutic potential of IKKÎµ siRNA on human breast cancer cells . METHODS Eight siRNAs targeting different regions of the IKKÎµ mRNA were designed , and the silencing effect was screened by quantitative real time RT-PCR . The biological effects of synthetic siRNAs on human breast cancer cells were investigated by examining the cell proliferation , migration , invasion , focus formation , anchorage-independent growth(via soft agar assay ) , cell cycle arrest , apoptosis ( via annexing binding ) , NF-ÎºB basal level , and NF-ÎºB related gene expressions upon the IKKÎµ silencing . RESULTS Silencing of IKKÎµ in human breast cancer cells resulted in decrease of focus formation potential and clonogenicity as well as in vitro cell migration/invasion capabilities . Moreover , knockdown of IKKÎµ suppressed cell proliferation . Cell cycle assay showed that the anti-proliferation effect of IKKÎµ siRNA was mediated by arresting cells in G(0)/G(1) phase , which was caused by down-regulation of cyclin D(1) . Furthermore , we demonstrated that silencing of IKKÎµ inhibited the NF-ÎºB basal activity as well as the Bcl-2 expression . Significant apoptosis was not observed in breast cancer cells upon the silencing of IKKÎµ . The present study provided the first evidence that silencing IKKÎµ using synthetic siRNA could inhibit the invasiveness properties and proliferation of breast cancer cells . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggested that silencing IKKÎµ using synthetic siRNA may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for breast cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis;evading growth suppressors;sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death
20890633	Designed from a high throughput screened hit compound , novel 2-amino-1-thiazolyl imidazoles were synthesized and demonstrated cytotoxicity against human cancer cells. 1-(4-Phenylthiazol-2-yl)-4-(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-imidazol-2-amine ( compound 2 ) , a 2-amino-1-thiazolyl imidazole , inhibited tubulin polymerization , interacted with the colchicine-binding sites of tubulins , and caused cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M phase in human gastric cancer cells . Disruption of the microtubule structure in cancer cells by compound 2 was also observed . Compound 2 concentration-dependently inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells in histocultured human gastric and colorectal tumors . Given orally , compound 2 prolonged the lifespans of leukemia mice intraperitoneally inoculated with the murine P388 leukemic cells . We report 2-amino-1-thiazolyl imidazoles as a novel class of orally active microtubule-destabilizing anticancer agents .	evading growth suppressors
20922140	OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between plasma levels of insulin-like growth factors-1 ( IGF-1 ) and IGF-binding protein-3 ( IGFBP-3 ) and the risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) and cervical cancer . METHODS Plasma levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 of 44 cervical cancer patients , 82 CIN patients and 40 neoplasm-free patients were investigated . Then the associations of the plasma levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 with cervical neoplasm or its clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed . RESULTS The mean IGF-1 concentrations were significantly different among the control , CIN , and cervical cancer groups ; the levels were higher in the CIN group compared to the controls . According to the quartile category , the plasma IGF-1 level was significantly higher ( p=0.0015 ) in the CIN group than in the controls . The IGFBP-3 level showed no association between the controls and CIN groups ( p=0.842 ) . Although the mean IGF-1/IGFBP-3 molar ratio had borderline significance ( p=0.08 ) among the study population , the quartile comparison showed a significantly higher IGF-1/IGFBP-3 molar ratio in the CIN group compared to the control group ( p=0.041 ) . CONCLUSION Plasma levels of IGF-1 and the IGF-1/IGFBP-3 molar ratio might be useful for the development early detection of cervical lesions and used as an adjuvant diagnostic tool for cervical neoplasia after more larger scale research .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20945273	A growing number of studies have demonstrated an association between serum levels of insulin-like growth factors ( IGFs ) and IGF binding protein-3 ( IGFBP-3 ) and increased risk for various cancers . The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between levels of IGF-II or IGFBP-3 in cervical scrapes with cervical cancer and precancerous lesions : low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( LSIL ) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL). 4 groups of cases were examined : LSIL ( n=20 ) , HSIL ( n=28 ) , cervical cancer ( n=45 ) , and controls ( n=51 ) . Control subjects were women with normal , HPV DNA-negative Papanicolau ( Pap ) test . IGF-II and IGFBP-3 levels in cervical scrapes were measured by ELISA . Results show that median protein levels of IGF-II were significantly lower in cervical cancer cases vs. controls ( 446.5 ng/mg vs. 1,168.6 ng/mg , p&lt;0.001 ) . Significantly higher values of IGFBP-3 were found in HSIL vs. controls ( median : 549.5 ng/mg vs. 216 ng/mg ; p=0.018 ) , and were not affected by HR HPV infection , meanwhile no significant differences were observed in IGFBP-3 levels between LSIL or cervical cancer as compared to controls . These data suggests that the progression to cervical cancer is associated with alterations in the IGF system and not affected by HR HPV infection . More studies are needed to understand the possible role of IGFBP-3 in cervical carcinogenesis .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20947717	Mode of action ( MOA ) analysis provides a systematic description of key events leading to adverse health effects in animal bioassays for the purpose of informing human health risk assessment . Uncertainties and data gaps identified in the MOA analysis may also be used to guide future research to improve understanding of the MOAs underlying a specific toxic response and foster development of toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic models . An MOA analysis , consistent with approaches outlined in the MOA Framework as described in the Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment , was conducted to evaluate small intestinal tumors observed in mice chronically exposed to relatively high concentrations of hexavalent chromium ( Cr(VI) ) in drinking water . Based on review of the literature , key events in the MOA are hypothesized to include saturation of the reductive capacity of the upper gastrointestinal tract , absorption of Cr(VI) into the intestinal epithelium , oxidative stress and inflammation , cell proliferation , direct and/or indirect DNA modification , and mutagenesis . Although available data generally support the plausibility of these key events , several unresolved questions and data gaps were identified , highlighting the need for obtaining critical toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic data in the target tissue and in the low-dose range . Experimental assays that can address these data gaps are discussed along with strategies for comparisons between responsive and nonresponsive tissues and species . This analysis provides a practical application of MOA Framework guidance and is instructive for the design of studies to improve upon the information available for quantitative risk assessment .	genomic instability and mutation;tumor promoting inflammation
20952396	Histone deacetylase inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells and are , therefore , promising anti-cancer drugs . The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is activated in histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor-treated tumor cells , and its growth-inhibitory function contributes to the anti-tumorigenic effect of HDAC inhibitors . We show here that induction of p21 by trichostatin A involves MAP kinase signaling . Activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway by growth factors or stress signals results in histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation at the p21 promoter and is crucial for acetylation of the neighboring lysine 14 and recruitment of activated RNA polymerase II in response to trichostatin A treatment . In non-induced cells , the protein phosphatase PP2A is associated with the p21 gene and counteracts its activation . Induction of p21 is linked to simultaneous acetylation and phosphorylation of histone H3 . The dual modification mark H3S10phK14ac at the activated p21 promoter is recognized by the phospho-binding protein 14-3-3Î¶ , which protects the phosphoacetylation mark from being processed by PP2A . Taken together we have revealed a cross-talk of reversible phosphorylation and acetylation signals that controls the activation of p21 by HDAC inhibitors and identify the phosphatase PP2A as chromatin-associated transcriptional repressor in mammalian cells .	evading growth suppressors;sustaining proliferative signaling
20967519	Accumulating evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that chronic inflammation and oxidative stress play critical roles in neoplastic development . The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidative stress activities , and differential regulation of Nrf2-mediated genes by tea Chrysanthemum zawadskii ( CZ ) and licorice Glycyrrhiza uralensis ( LE ) extracts . The anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress activities of hexane/ethanol extracts of CZ and LE were investigated using in vitro and in vivo approaches , including quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR ) and microarray . Additionally , the role of the transcriptional factor Nrf2 ( nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 ) signaling pathways was examined . Our results show that CZ and LE extracts exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activities by suppressing the mRNA and protein expression levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers IL-1Î² , IL-6 , COX-2 and iNOS in LPS-stimulated murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells . CZ and LE also significantly suppressed the NO production of LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells . Additionally , CZ and LE suppressed the NF-ÎºB luciferase activity in human HT-29 colon cancer cells . Both extracts also showed strong Nrf2-mediated antioxidant/Phase II detoxifying enzymes induction . CZ and LE induced NQO1 , Nrf2 , and UGT and antioxidant response element ( ARE)-luciferase activity in human hepatoma HepG2 C8 cells . Using Nrf2 knockout [ Nrf2 ( -/-) ] and Nrf2 wild-type ( +/+ ) mice , LE and CZ showed Nrf2-dependent transactivation of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant and phase II detoxifying genes . In summary , CZ and LE possess strong inhibitory effects against NF-ÎºB-mediated inflammatory as well as strong activation of the Nrf2-ARE-anti-oxidative stress signaling pathways , which would contribute to their overall health promoting pharmacological effects against diseases including cancer .	tumor promoting inflammation
20978325	INTRODUCTION The progressive growth of malignancies is accompanied by a decline in the immune response through mechanisms which are poorly understood . Apoptosis and induction of inflammation by tumor released cytokines as tumor escape mechanisms have been proposed to play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis . METHODS Expression of Tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-Î± ) was analyzed in colorectal cancer specimen and the cancer cell line HT-29 by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR . TNF-Î± expression on protein and mRNA level were correlated with clinical characteristics and impact on survival . TNFR-1 was co-labelled with TNF-Î± and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in immunofluorescence double staining experiments . RESULTS 94% ( n=98/104 ) of the patients with CRC expressed TNF-Î± . High TNF-Î± expression was significantly associated with positive lymph node stage and recurrence of the tumor . Multivariate analysis revealed high TNF-Î± expression as an independent prognostic factor . Immunohistochemistry was correlated with RT-PCR results ( Ï=0.794 ) . Immunofluorescence double staining experiments revealed increased TNFR-1 expression by CD8+ cells . CONCLUSIONS TNF-Î± expression by tumor cells may be an efficient immunological escape mechanism by inflammation-enhanced metastases and probably by induction of apoptosis in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ immune cells resulting in a down regulation of the tumoral immune response . Our data support the role of tumor-derived TNF-Î± expression as an important promoter of tumoral immune escape mechanisms and malignant progression , and suggest that analysis on either protein ( immunohistochemistry ) or RNA level ( RT-PCR ) can be used effectively in this respect . Targeting TNF-Î± may be a promising option , especially in cases with high TNF-Î± expression and positive lymph node metastases .	tumor promoting inflammation;activating invasion and metastasis
21030559	Levels of regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) are increased in different cancer types as well as in inflammatory diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis . Treg accumulation may result from aberrant proliferation and trafficking as well as greater resilience to oxidative stress compared with conventional T cells . This enhanced antioxidative capacity of Tregs possibly serves as feedback inhibition during inflammation and prevents uncontrolled immune reactions by favoring survival of suppressor rather than effector cells . In this study , we demonstrate that human Tregs express and secrete higher levels of thioredoxin-1 , a major antioxidative molecule . Thioredoxin-1 has an essential role in maintaining their surface thiol density as the first line of antioxidative defense mechanisms and is sensitive to proinflammatory stimuli , mainly tumor necrosis factor-Î± , in a nuclear factor-ÎºB-dependent fashion . The antiapoptotic and oncogenic potential of ( secreted ) Trx-1 suggests that it may exert effects in Tregs beyond redox regulation .	tumor promoting inflammation
21039035	BACKGROUND Apoptosis , a widely important mechanism that contributes to cell growth reduction , is reported to be induced by Crocus sativus in different cancer types . The present study was designed to elucidate apoptosis induction by crocin , a main component of Crocus sativus in a human pancreatic cancer cell line ( BxPC-3 ) . METHODS Cell viability was measured by MTT assay , Hoechest33258 staining was used to detect the chromatin condensation characteristic of apoptosis , and DNA fragmentation was assessed by gel electrophoresis and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry . RESULTS Crocin induced apoptosis and G1-phase cell cycle arrest of BxPC-3 cells , while decreasing cell viability in a dose dependent and time dependent manner . Cells treated with 10Î¼g/L crocin exhibited apoptotic morphology ( brightly blue-fluorescent condensed nuclei on Hoechst 33258 staining ) and reduction of volume . DNA analysis revealed typical ladders as early as 12 hours after treatment indicative of apoptosis . CONCLUSION Our preclinical study demonstrated a pancreatic cancer cell line to be highly sensitive to crocin-mediated growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death . Although the molecular mechanisms of crocin action are not yet clearly understood , it appears to have potential as a therapeutic agent .	evading growth suppressors;resisting cell death
21044925	BACKGROUND AND AIMS breast reconstruction with silicone prosthesis following nipple-sparing mastectomy has become widely accepted as a reconstruction option in women requiring mastectomy for cancer . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and some factors influencing early local complications in patients undergoing NSM with immediate implant reconstruction . MATERIAL AND METHODS prospective study was performed on a consecutive series of 214 breast reconstructions in 205 patients . All complications during the six weeks after surgery were recorded. 42 prostheses were implanted after neoadjuvant chemotherapy , 27 patients previously had radiotherapy due to breast conserving surgery and in all other cases surgery was the pri-mary treatment for cancer . RESULTS the overall six-week complication rate was 16% ( 35 ) and included : major skin flap necrosis ( 4% , 9 procedures ) , minor skin necrosis ( 3% , 7 ) , major infection ( 2% , 5 ) , minor infection ( 3% , 7 ) , prolonged seroma formation ( 3% , 6 ) , haematoma ( 1% , 2 ) and epidermolysis ( 1% , 2 ) . In 6% ( 12 ) reconstruction procedures explantation of prosthesis was done . Neoadjuvant chemo-therapy and radiotherapy were not associated with higher rate of complications . CONCLUSION nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction has acceptable morbidity rate in the hand of experienced oncoplastic surgeon and therefore should be considered as treatment option to women requiring mastectomy .	resisting cell death
21058190	Quercetin is a flavonoid with anticancer properties . In this study , we examined the effects of quercetin on cell cycle , viability , and proliferation of cancer cells , either singly or in combination with the microtubule-targeting drugs taxol and nocodazole . Although quercetin induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner , 12.5-50 Î¼M quercetin inhibited the activity of both taxol and nocodazole to induce G2/M arrest in various cell lines . Quercetin also partially restored drug-induced loss in viability of treated cells for up to 72 h . This antagonism of microtubule-targeting drugs was accompanied by a delay in cell cycle progression and inhibition of the buildup of cyclin-B1 at the microtubule organizing center of treated cells . However , quercetin did not inhibit the microtubule targeting of taxol or nocodazole . Despite the short-term protection of cells by quercetin , colony formation and clonogenicity of HCT116 cells were still suppressed by quercetin or quercetin-taxol combination . The status of cell adherence to growth matrix was critical in determining the sensitivity of HCT116 cells to quercetin . We conclude that although long-term exposure of cancer cells to quercetin may prevent cell proliferation and survival , the interference of quercetin with cell cycle progression diminishes the efficacy of microtubule-targeting drugs to arrest cells at G2/M .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21071263	The incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) is increasing but the long-term survival rate remains low . An animal model would therefore be helpful for evaluation of new treatment modalities for oral SCC . Hamster is small animal , therefore , the cancer of hamster cheek pouch is not optimal for tumor imaging . The VX2 cell line has been used in many carcinoma-related studies , including oral SCC research , but it is derived from cutaneous tissue and not mucosa . We chemically induced tongue squamous cell carcinoma in rabbits and subsequently established a rabbit squamous cell line . The cells grew in multiple layers without contact inhibition for 60 passages over 2 years and were positive for cytokeratin ( CK ) . Electron microscopy revealed that cells were polygonal with rich microvilli on the surface , and there were desmosomes between cells and bundles of tonofibril beside the cell membrane . The chromosome number ranged from 71 to 272 , with a modal value of 145 ( 12.4% ) . The cells were transplantable into nude mice subcutaneously or rabbit submucosally and produced carcinomas in all the animals . The cell line should be a useful tool for the study of the biological characteristics of oral SCC , especially tongue SCC .	evading growth suppressors
21086092	C-reactive protein is produced in response to cytokines such as interleukin ( IL)-6 . It is known that increased plasma IL-6 levels induce increased hepatic and intratumoral production of C-reactive protein . Cyclooxygenase enzyme-2 is induced by various stimuli , including inflammation and various growth factors . Expression of these two markers has not been well studied in clear cell renal cell carcinoma . The objective of this study is to correlate the expression of C-reactive protein and cyclooxygenase enzyme-2 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma with pathologic parameters . A search of the surgical pathology and consultation files at our institution was performed for nephrectomy specimens with clear cell renal cell carcinoma from 2007 to 2008 . Immunohistochemical stains for C-reactive protein and cyclooxygenase enzyme-2 were performed . Staining intensity was graded as 0 , 1+ , 2+ , and 3+ . The staining intensity was then correlated with pathologic stage and Fuhrman nuclear grade for each case . A total of 110 cases were identified . Strong expression of C-reactive protein was associated with higher Fuhrman nuclear grade and pathologic stage , and the strength of correlation was statistically significant ( pâ=â0.01 and pâ=â0.001 ) , respectively . However , cyclooxygenase enzyme-2 expression did not show statistically significant correlation with both pathologic stage and Fuhrman nuclear grade ( pâ=â0.1 and pâ=â0.15 ) , respectively . To our knowledge , this is the largest study to date correlating the expression of both C-reactive protein and cyclooxygenase enzyme-2 in tissue with pathologic parameters in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma , which could have significant prognostic and therapeutic implications .	tumor promoting inflammation
21108794	BACKGROUND To identify potential tumor suppressor genes , genome-wide data from exome and transcriptome sequencing were combined to search for genes with loss of heterozygosity and allele-specific expression . The analysis was conducted on the breast cancer cell line HCC1954 , and a lymphoblast cell line from the same individual , HCC1954BL . RESULTS By comparing exome sequences from the two cell lines , we identified loss of heterozygosity events at 403 genes in HCC1954 and at one gene in HCC1954BL . The combination of exome and transcriptome sequence data also revealed 86 and 50 genes with allele specific expression events in HCC1954 and HCC1954BL , which comprise 5.4% and 2.6% of genes surveyed , respectively . Many of these genes identified by loss of heterozygosity and allele-specific expression are known or putative tumor suppressor genes , such as BRCA1 , MSH3 and SETX , which participate in DNA repair pathways . CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that the combined application of high throughput sequencing to exome and allele-specific transcriptome analysis can reveal genes with known tumor suppressor characteristics , and a shortlist of novel candidates for the study of tumor suppressor activities .	genomic instability and mutation
21116101	The radioprotective effects of dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) have been known for many years , and the suppression of hydroxyl ( OH ) radicals induced by ionizing radiation has been thought to be the main cause of this effect . However , the DMSO concentration used was very high , and might be toxic , in earlier studies . In the present study , we administered a lower , non-toxic concentration ( 0.5% , i.e. , 64 mM ) of DMSO before irradiation and examined its radioprotective effects . Colony formation assay and micronucleus assay showed significant radioprotective effects in CHO , but not in xrs5 , which is defective in the repair function of DNA double-strand breaks . The levels of phosphorylated H2AX and the formation of 53BP1 foci 15 minutes after irradiation , which might reflect initial DNA double-strand breaks , in DMSO-treated CHO cells were similar to those in non-treated cells , suggesting that the radioprotective effects were not attributable to the suppression of general indirect action in the lower concentration of DMSO . On the other hand , 2 hours after irradiation , the average number of 53BP1 foci , which might reflect residual DNA double-strand breaks , was significantly decreased in DMSO-treated CHO cells compared to non-treated cells . The results indicated that low concentration of DMSO exerts radioprotective effects through the facilitation of DNA double-strand break repair rather than through the suppression of indirect action .	genomic instability and mutation
21118556	BACKGROUND IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that signals via binding to a soluble or membrane bound receptor , while nitric oxide ( NO ) , an oxidative stress molecule , diffuses through the cell membrane without a receptor . Both mediators signal through different mechanisms , yet they are dependent on NFÎºB . We proposed that both mediators are co-induced and co-regulated in inflamed mammary epithelial cells . METHODS SCp2 mammary epithelial cells were treated with bacterial endotoxin ( ET ) for different time periods and analyzed for induction of IL-6 secretion and NO production by ELISA and Griess reaction , respectively . The expression of IL-6 and induced NO synthase ( iNOS ) was assayed by real time PCR and/or western immunoblots , and the activation of NFÎºB was assayed by immunobinding assay . To investigate the role of mammary cell microenvironment ( cell-substratum or interaction of mammary epithelial cell types ; critical to mammary development , function , and disease ) in modulation of the inflammatory response , SCp2 cells were cultured with or without extracellular matrix ( EHS ) or in coculture with their myoepithelial counterpart ( SCg6 ) , and assayed for ET-induced IL-6 and NO . RESULTS Endotoxin induced NFÎºB activation at 1 h after ET application . IL-6 secretion and NO production were induced , but with unexpected delay in expression of mRNA for iNOS compared to IL-6 . NFÎºB/p65 activation was transient but NFÎºB/p50 activation persisted longer . Selective inhibition of NFÎºB activation by Wedelolactone reduced ET-induced expression of IL-6 mRNA and protein but not iNOS mRNA or NO production , suggesting differences in IL-6 and iNOS regulation via NFÎºB . SCp2 cells in coculture with SCg6 but not in presence of EHS dramatically induced IL-6 secretion even in the absence of ET . ET-induced NO production was blunted in SCp2/SCg6 cocultures compared to that in SCp2 alone . CONCLUSIONS The differential regulation of IL-6 and iNOS together with the differential activation of different NFÎºB dimers suggest that IL-6 and iNOS are regulated by different NFÎºB dimers , and differentially regulated by the microenvironment of epithelial cells . The understanding of innate immune responses and inflammation in epithelia and linkage thereof is crucial for understanding the link between chronic inflammation and cancer in epithelial tissues such as the mammary gland .	tumor promoting inflammation
21131419	Heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) is a molecular chaperone involved in folding and stabilizing multiple intracellular proteins that have roles in cell activation and proliferation . Many Hsp90 client proteins in tumor cells are mutated or overexpressed oncogenic proteins driving cancer cell growth , leading to the acceptance of Hsp90 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer . Because several signal transduction molecules that are dependent on Hsp90 function are also involved in activation of innate and adaptive cells of the immune system , we investigated the mechanism by which inhibiting Hsp90 leads to therapeutic efficacy in rodent models of inflammation and autoimmunity . EC144 , a synthetic Hsp90 inhibitor , blocked LPS-induced TLR4 signaling in RAW 264.7 cells by inhibiting activation of ERK1/2 , MEK1/2 , JNK , and p38 MAPK but not NF-ÎºB . Ex vivo LPS-stimulated CD11b(+) peritoneal exudate cells from EC144-treated mice were blocked from phosphorylating tumor progression locus 2 , MEK1/2 , and ERK1/2 . Consequently , EC144-treated mice were resistant to LPS administration and had suppressed systemic TNF-Î± release . Inhibiting Hsp90 also blocked in vitro CD4(+) T cell proliferation in mouse and human MLRs . In vivo , semitherapeutic administration of EC144 blocked disease development in rat collagen-induced arthritis by suppressing the inflammatory response . In a mouse collagen-induced arthritis model , EC144 also suppressed disease development , which correlated with a suppressed Ag-specific Ab response and a block in activation of Ag-specific CD4(+) T cells . Our results describe mechanisms by which blocking Hsp90 function may be applicable to treatment of autoimmune diseases involving inflammation and activation of the adaptive immune response .	sustaining proliferative signaling;tumor promoting inflammation
21134984	BACKGROUND Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells show prolonged survival in vivo , but rapidly die by spontaneous apoptosis in vitro , unless they are co-cultured with stromal cells or non-malignant leukocytes . The objective of this study was to characterize the survival-inducing cross-talk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with their microenvironment to identify novel therapeutic targets . DESIGN AND METHODS We analyzed and compared microarray-based expression profiles of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells before and after three different survival-inducing culture conditions : ( i ) stromal cell co-culture , ( ii ) stromal cell conditioned medium and ( iii ) high cell density cultures of unsorted peripheral blood mononuclear cells . Cytokine antibody arrays were applied to study the composition of soluble factors present in these cultures . RESULTS The different survival-supportive culture conditions induced distinct gene expression changes , the majority of which were common to all three conditions . Pathway analyses identified - in addition to known signaling networks in chronic lymphocytic leukemia - novel pathways , of which Toll-like receptor signaling , nuclear respiratory factor-2 ( NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response , and signaling via triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 ( TREM1 ) were the most relevant . A high proportion of up-regulated genes were inflammatory cytokines , of which chemokine ( C-C motif ) ligand 2 ( CCL2 ) was shown to be induced in monocytes by the presence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro . In addition , increased serum levels of this chemokine were detected in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia . CONCLUSIONS Our data provide several lines of evidence that an inflammatory microenvironment is induced in survival-supportive cultures of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells which might be directly or indirectly involved in the prolonged survival of the malignant cells .	tumor promoting inflammation
21141739	Deregulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) is closely associated with malignant transformation and tumor cell survival in various cancers . We found that IGF-1R expression level in leukemia cells positively correlated with the percentage of blast in bone marrow from de novo acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patients . Moreover , we showed that NVP-ADW742 , a novel small weight molecular inhibitor of IGF-IR , could induce apoptosis in both HL-60 cell line and primary AML blasts . However , no significant alteration of cell cycle was observed in HL-60 cells . Further studies revealed that NVP-ADW742 induced Akt dephosphorylation , which might subsequently induce p38 phosphorylation and decrease antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression in HL-60 cells . Finally , we demonstrated that NVP-ADW742 could synergize with Ara-C to induce the kill in a subset of drug-resistant AML specimens . We suggested that IGF-lR targeting might be therapeutically beneficial for some AML patients .	sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death;evading growth suppressors
21148072	"Recently , we identified the "" apoptotic ring, "" containing phosphorylated histone H2AX ( Î³-H2AX ) , as an early chromatin modification during apoptosis . Because Î³-H2AX initiates the DNA damage response ( DDR ) , we tested whether the apoptotic H2AX response leads to the full recruitment of the DDR factors that normally coordinate DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoints . We show that the apoptotic H2AX response does not recruit the DDR factors because MDC1 ( mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 ) , which normally binds to Î³-H2AX in response to DNA damage and amplifies the DDR , is cleaved by caspase-3 . This cleavage separates the BRCT and FHA domains of MDC1 and constitutes a novel mechanism for the inactivation of DNA repair in apoptotic cells . Also , we show that downregulation of MDC1 increases the apoptotic response to TRAIL .

Currently , a major concern is that with the increasing use and production of these materials , there may be increased health risks to exposed workers . Long ( &gt ; 15 microm ) straight nanotubes may undergo frustrated phagocytosis which is likely to result in reduced clearance . We examine here the effects of multiwalled carbon nanotubes of different sizes on monocytic THP-1 cells , with regard to their ability to stimulate increased expression of the HO-1 and GST genes and their ability to produce nuclear translocation of the transcription factor , Nrf2 , as well as the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators of inflammation . Our results suggest that long ( 50 microm ) carbon nanotubes ( 62.5 microg/ml for 4 hours ) produce increased nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and increased HO-1 gene expression compared with shorter entangled nanotubes . There was no increased gene expression for GST . The long nanotubes ( NT1 ) caused increased release of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta , an effect which was diminished by the antioxidant trolox , suggesting a role of oxidative stress in the upregulation of this cytokine . Tentatively , our study suggests that long carbon nanotubes may exert their effect in THP-1 cells in part via an oxidative stress mechanism .	tumor promoting inflammation
21180766	RKIP-1 is a metastasis suppressor that is frequently downregulated in aggressive cancers . However , the consequences of RKIP loss in primary or immortalized cells have not yet been explored . Using HEK-293 RKIP depleted ( termed HEK-499 ) and Flp-In T-Rex-293 RKIP inducible cell lines combined with whole transcriptome analysis , we show that RKIP-1 silencing accelerates DNA synthesis and G1/S transition entry by inducing the expression of cdc6 , MCM 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , cdc45L , cyclin D2 , cyclin E2 , cyclin D1 , SKP2 and the downregulation of p21(cip1) . Moreover , RKIP depletion accelerates the time from nuclear envelop breakdown ( NEB ) to anaphase markedly , while the upregulation of RKIP shortened the NEB to anaphase time . We show that RKIP depletion induces the expression of NEK6 , a molecule known to enhance G2/M transition , and down-regulates G2/M checkpoint molecules like Aurora B , cyclin G1 and sertuin that slow the G2/M transition time . These subtle changes in the kinetics of the cell cycle culminate in a higher proliferation rate of HEK-499 compared to control cells . Finally , we show that RKIP depletion enhances cellular motility by inducing the expression/stabilization of Î²-catenin , vimentin , MET and PAK1 . Overall , our data suggest that modulation of the cell cycle checkpoints and motility by RKIP may be fundamental to its metastasis suppressive function in cancer and that RKIP role in a cell is more intricate and diverse than previously thought .	sustaining proliferative signaling;activating invasion and metastasis
21187506	Bone is the second most common metastatic site in patients with renal cell carcinoma presenting with metastases ( mRCC ) at diagnosis . Complications of metastatic bone disease , including bone pain , fractures , spinal cord compression , and hypercalcaemia , are the primary cause of decline in the quality of life of patients with mRCC . Currently , treatment for mRCC bone metastases is generally palliative . Bisphosphonates are also used ; however , the efficacy of bisphosphonates in conjunction with targeted agents is currently unknown . As growth factors play a critical role in the development of bone metastases , there is a biological rationale for the use of targeted agents to treat them . We report here the case of two patients with mRCC with surgically unresectable sacral bone metastases treated with sunitinib , who are still alive with long-term stabilization of metastases of 48 and 31 months . Results suggest targeted agents such as sunitinib may be an effective treatment for bone metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
21193016	Despite the deployment of multimodal therapies involving neurosurgical resection , radio- and polychemotherapy , the prognosis for glioblastoma patients remains poor . These tumors are pathologically characterized by their associated angiogenesis and diffuse brain invasion , processes that are probably closely linked to the unfavorable prognosis of this disease . Accordingly , pharmacological inhibition of glioblastoma invasion and approaches that impede angiogenesis are considered to be promising therapeutic strategies to combat these tumors . Nevertheless , the anti-angiogenic therapies for glioblastoma currently available are transient and palliative at best . Blocking the effects of fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) may represent a novel mean of inhibiting the angiogenesis associated with glioblastoma , as it mediates the angiogenesis induced by other factors and it is an angiogenic factor by itself . In addition , the survival of glioma cells and their resistance to chemotherapeutic agents are highly FGF-dependent . We show here that a recently described inhibitor of FGF , 2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-sulfonate ( 2,5DHPS , dobesilate ) , stimulates the apoptosis of tumor cells , inhibits glioblastoma invasion and suppresses its associated angiogenesis . Moreover , this agent augments the efficiency of chemotherapeutic agents in a rat model of orthotopic brain tumor . These results suggest that 2,5DHPS treatment may represent a promising therapy for malignant glioma .	inducing angiogenesis;sustaining proliferative signaling
21195136	Modeling the behavior of mammalian arachnoid cells is critical to understand hydrocephalus and other brain disorders involving abnormal flow of cerebrospinal fluid , yet relatively little is known about the physiology of arachnoid cells due to lack of a robust three-dimensional model system . Explanted primary cultures have been the only option to study transport across arachnoid cell membranes , but practical limitations of primary culture include slow growth , early senescence , and poor reproducibility . The purpose of this study was to create immortalized rat arachnoid cell lines to permit in vitro study of arachnoid granulations and properties of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) flow . We established and partially characterized two immortalized cell lines generated from primary rat arachnoid cells , using retroviral gene transfer of SV40 large T antigen ( SV40 LTAg ) either with or without human telomerase ( hTERT ) . The established cell lines stably express either SV40 LTAg alone , or SV40 LTAg and hTERT , and demonstrate high proliferative rate , contact inhibition at confluence , and stable expression of protein markers characteristic of native arachnoid cells over more than 160 passages .	enabling replicative immortality;evading growth suppressors
21195710	Melanoma cells express and interact with laminins ( LMs ) and other basement membrane components during invasion and metastasis . In the present study we have investigated the production and migration-promoting activity of laminin isoforms in melanoma . Immunohistochemistry of melanoma specimens and immunoprecipitation/western blotting of melanoma cell lines indicated expression of laminin-111/121 , laminin-211 , laminin-411/421 , and laminin-511/521 . Laminin-332 was not detected . In functional assays , laminin-111 , laminin-332 , and laminin-511 , but not laminin-211 and laminin-411 , strongly promoted haptotactic cell migration either constitutively or following stimulation with insulin-like growth factors . Both placenta and recombinant laminin-511 preparations were highly active , and the isolated recombinant IVa domain of LMÎ±5 also promoted cell migration . Function-blocking antibodies in cell migration assays revealed Î±6Î²1 integrin as the major receptor for laminin-111 , and both Î±3Î²1 and Î±6Î²1 integrins for laminin-332 and laminin-511 . In contrast , isolated LMÎ±5 IVa domain-promoted melanoma cell migration was largely mediated via Î±VÎ²3 integrin and inhibited by RGD peptides . Given the ubiquitous expression of Î±5 laminins in melanoma cells and in melanoma-target tissues/anatomical structures , as well as the strong migration-promoting activity of these laminin isoforms , the Î±5 laminins emerge as putative primary extracellular matrix mediators of melanoma invasion and metastasis via Î±3Î²1 and other integrin receptors .	sustaining proliferative signaling;activating invasion and metastasis
21198260	DNA repair enzymes play an important role in the development of various kinds of cancer . We here analyzed associations of XPD Lys751Gln , APEX1 Asp148Glu , XRCC1 Arg399Gln , and XRCC3 Thr241Met gene polymorphisms in DNA repair pathways in relation to the risk of lung cancer using PCR-RFLP . The study involved 104 lung cancer patients and 120 non-cancer controls divided into non-smokers and smokers . We found a statistically significant interaction between APEX1 Asp148Glu and the risk for lung cancer ( adjusted OR 2.78 , 95% CI 1.58-4.90 , p=0.0004 ) , of both adenocarcinoma ( adjusted OR 2.24 , 95%CI 1.18-4.25 , p=0.014 ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( adjusted OR 4.75 , 95%CI 1.79-12.6 , p=0.002 ) types . XRCC1 Arg399Gln showed a borderline significant association with adenocarcinoma ( adjusted OR 1.89 , 95%CI 1.00-3.57 , p=0.051 ) . The combined effect of smoking and presence of the APEX1 Asp148Glu demonstrated a significant association with risk of lung cancer ( adjusted OR 3.61 , 95% CI 1.74-7.50 , p=0.001 ) . The XPD Lys751Gln and XRCC3 Thr241Met genotypes displayed no statistically significant risk . Our findings suggest that the APEX1 Asp148Glu is associated with increased risk for primary lung cancer in Japanese individuals partaking in smoking .	genomic instability and mutation
21203561	BACKGROUND NFÎºB signaling is of paramount importance in the regulation of apoptosis , proliferation , and inflammatory responses during human development and homeostasis , as well as in many human cancers . Receptor Tyrosine Kinases ( RTKs ) , including the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors ( FGFRs ) are also important in development and disease . However , a direct relationship between growth factor signaling pathways and NFÎºB activation has not been previously described , although FGFs have been known to antagonize TNFÎ±-induced apoptosis . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Here , we demonstrate an interaction between FGFR4 and IKKÎ² ( Inhibitor of NFÎºB Kinase Î² subunit ) , an essential component in the NFÎºB pathway . This novel interaction was identified utilizing a yeast two-hybrid screen [ 1 ] and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis . We demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation of IKKÎ² in the presence of activated FGFR4 , but not kinase-dead FGFR4 . Following stimulation by TNFÎ± ( Tumor Necrosis Factor Î± ) to activate NFÎºB pathways , FGFR4 activation results in significant inhibition of NFÎºB signaling as measured by decreased nuclear NFÎºB localization , by reduced NFÎºB transcriptional activation in electophoretic mobility shift assays , and by inhibition of IKKÎ² kinase activity towards the substrate GST-IÎºBÎ± in in vitro assays . FGF19 stimulation of endogenous FGFR4 in TNFÎ±-treated DU145 prostate cancer cells also leads to a decrease in IKKÎ² activity , concomitant reduction in NFÎºB nuclear localization , and reduced apoptosis . Microarray analysis demonstrates that FGF19 + TNFÎ± treatment of DU145 cells , in comparison with TNFÎ± alone , favors proliferative genes while downregulating genes involved in apoptotic responses and NFÎºB signaling . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These results identify a compelling link between FGFR4 signaling and the NFÎºB pathway , and reveal that FGFR4 activation leads to a negative effect on NFÎºB signaling including an inhibitory effect on proapoptotic signaling . We anticipate that this interaction between an RTK and a component of NFÎºB signaling will not be limited to FGFR4 alone .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21255184	By using the rat azoxymethane ( AOM)-induced colon carcinogenesis model , which mirrors many clinical features of human colorectal cancer , we examined whether genetic changes occurring early in colonic mucosa are predictive of treatment efficacy . In the present study the administration of the chemopreventive agent lupulone over the course of 7 weeks postinitiation reduced the number of preneoplastic lesions in the colonic mucosa by 50% . At the molecular level we observed the downregulation of genes involved in the inflammatory response , including IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± , and of matrix metalloproteinase-7 gene and protein expression . We also observed a substantial upregulation of components of the innate immune system , Î±-defensin-5 and lipocalin 2 . Lupulone induced the expression of apoptosis-related genes and caused a reversal of the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 ( Bcl-2 ; antiapoptotic ) to Bcl-2 associated X protein ( Bax ; proapoptotic ) transcript and protein ratios ( Bcl-2/Bax &gt ; 1 in AOM controls and Bcl-2/Bax &lt ; 1 in lupulone-treated AOM rats ) . Here , we identify several target genes that could be considered early biomarkers of colon carcinogenesis and indicative of drug efficacy .	tumor promoting inflammation;resisting cell death
21290343	Background : Several polymorphisms in the DNA repair gene have been extensively studied in the association with various human cancers such as breast cancer . Material and methods : We investigated the association of polymorphisms in the DNA repair genes XRCC1-Arg399Gln , XRCC2-Arg188His and RAD51-135G/C with the breast cancer risk . Genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP assays in 220 patients with breast cancer and 220 age-matched healthy controls . Results : Our results demonstrated a significant positive association between the XRCC1 399Gln/Gln homozygous genotype and breast carcinoma , with an adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) of 2.08 [ 1.08-3.98 ] . The 399Gln allele variant was also associated with type I breast cancer ( OR = 1.41 [ 0.98-2.01 ] , p = 0.034 ) . The distributions of genotypes and alleles of the genes XRCC2 and RAD51 polymorphism were not significantly associated with the different stages of breast carcinoma ( p &gt ; 0.05 ) . Conclusion : These results suggest that 399Gln allele of XRCC1 Arg399Gln may be a risk factor for breast cancer in the Polish population .	genomic instability and mutation
21412013	OBJECTIVES Despite the well-defined histological types of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , a given stage is often associated with wide-ranging survival rates and treatment outcomes . This disparity has led to an increased demand for the discovery and identification of new informative biomarkers . METHODS In the current study , we screened 81 NSCLC samples using Illumina whole-genome gene expression microarrays in an effort to identify differentially expressed genes and new NSCLC biomarkers . RESULTS We identified novel genes whose expression was upregulated in NSCLC , including SPAG5 , POLH , KIF23 , and RAD54L , which are associated with mitotic spindle formation , DNA repair , chromosome segregation , and dsDNA break repair , respectively . We also identified several novel genes whose expression was downregulated in NSCLC , including SGCG , NLRC4 , MMRN1 , and SFTPD , which are involved in extracellular matrix formation , apoptosis , blood vessel leakage , and inflammation , respectively . We found a significant correlation between RNA degradation and survival in adenocarcinoma cases . CONCLUSIONS Even though the follow-up time was too limited to draw final conclusions , we were able to show better prediction p values in a group selection based on molecular profiles compared to histology . The current study also uncovered new candidate biomarker genes that are likely to be involved in diverse processes associated with NSCLC development .	genomic instability and mutation
21480565	Radiotherapy for head and neck tumors often results in persistent loss of function in salivary glands . Patients suffering from impaired salivary function frequently terminate treatment prematurely because of reduced quality of life caused by malnutrition and other debilitating side-effects . It has been previously shown in mice expressing a constitutively active form of Akt ( myr-Akt1 ) , or in mice pretreated with IGF1 , apoptosis is suppressed , which correlates with maintained salivary gland function measured by stimulated salivary flow . Induction of cell cycle arrest may be important for this protection by allowing cells time for DNA repair . We have observed increased accumulation of cells in G2/M at acute time-points after irradiation in parotid glands of mice receiving pretreatment with IGF1 . As p21 , a transcriptional target of the p53 family , is necessary for maintaining G2/M arrest , we analyzed the roles of p53 and p63 in modulating IGF1-stimulated p21 expression . Pretreatment with IGF1 reduces binding of ÎNp63 to the p21 promoter after irradiation , which coincides with increased p53 binding and sustained p21 transcription . Our data indicate a role for ÎNp63 in modulating p53-dependent gene expression and influencing whether a cell death or cell cycle arrest program is initiated .	evading growth suppressors;sustaining proliferative signaling
21557329	Ultraviolet ( UV ) of sunlight is a complete carcinogen that can burn skin , enhance inflammation , and drive skin carcinogenesis . Previously , we have shown that sulforaphane ( SFN ) inhibited chemically induced skin carcinogenesis via nuclear factor ( erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 ( Nrf2 ) and others have shown that broccoli sprout extracts containing high SFN protected against UV-induced skin carcinogenesis in SKH-1 hairless mice . A recent study showed that there was no difference between Nrf2 knockout ( Nrf2 KO ) and Nrf2 wild-type ( WT ) BALB/C mice after exposing to high dose of UVB . Since Nrf2 plays critical roles in the anti-oxidative stress/anti-inflammatory responses , it is relevant to assess the role of Nrf2 for photoprotection against UV . In this context , the role of Nrf2 in UVB-induced skin inflammation in Nrf2 WT and Nrf2 KO C57BL/6 mice was studied . A single dose of UVB ( 300âmJ/cm(2) ) resulted in skin inflammation in both WT and Nrf2 KO ( -/- ) mice ( KO mice ) at 8âh and 8âd following UVB irradiation . In the WT mice inflammation returned to the basal level to a greater extent when compared to the KO mice . SFN treatment of Nrf2 WT but not Nrf2 KO mice restored the number of sunburn cells back to their basal level by 8âd after UVB irradiation . Additionally , UVB-induced short-term inflammatory biomarkers ( interleukin-1Î² and interleukin-6 ) were increased in the KO mice and UVB-induced apoptotic cells in the KO mice were significantly higher as compared to that in the WT . Taken together , our results show that functional Nrf2 confers a protective effect against UVB-induced inflammation , sunburn reaction , and SFN-mediated photoprotective effects in the skin .	tumor promoting inflammation
21917986	We recently isolated an exon-4-deleted epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) variant , termed de4 EGFR . Because the extracellular domain alteration of receptors often influences the antitumor effect of therapeutic antibodies , it is essential to test the sensitivity of de4 EGFR(+) tumors to anti-EGFR antibodies . Therefore , in this study , the antitumor activities of mAb CH12 , an anti-EGFRvIII antibody developed in our laboratory , as well as a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-EGFR antibody , cetuximab ( C225 ) , were characterized on de4 EGFR(+) models . The results of FACS assays showed that CH12 bound to de4 EGFR with a higher avidity than did C225 . Interestingly , CH12 , but not C225 , significantly inhibited the metastasis and growth of U87MG-de4 EGFR xenografts , with a growth-inhibition ratio of 46.48% in vivo , and prolonged the survival of the tumor-bearing mice by 37.2% . Treatment with CH12 significantly suppressed tumor proliferation and angiogenesis with increased tumor apoptosis . Mechanistically , de4 EGFR protein expression was virtually undetectable in the U87MG-de4 EGFR xenografts treated with CH12 . This may account for the observed reduction of Akt and Erk phosphorylation , cyclin D1 , Bcl-2 , and Bcl-x(L) expression and the increase of p27 and E-cadherin expression . Intriguingly , LAMP-1 , a major component of the lysosome , was significantly up-regulated in the CH12-treated group but not in the C225-treated group , suggesting its contribution to the degradation of de4 EGFR . Taken together , our data demonstrated that mAb CH12 is a promising therapeutic agent for treating de4 EGFR(+) gliomas .	activating invasion and metastasis;inducing angiogenesis;resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling
22075705	Endothelin plays important roles in various physiological functions including vascular constriction . Recent studies reported that the endothelin receptors ETA and ETB are highly expressed in lung and skin tumor tissues . In contrast , there are few reports on endothelin signalling in the proliferation of head and neck cancer . We found that both ETA and ETB endothelin receptors were overexpressed in tumor cells of tongue cancer samples by immunohistochemistry . ETA and ETB were expressed in cultured lingual and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( SCCs ) cell lines . When both cultured cell lines were treated with an ETA selective antagonist ( BQ123 ) or an ETB selective antagonist ( BQ788 ) , inhibition of cell growth was observed . Similar results were observed when SCCs were treated with specific siRNA for the suppression of ETA or ETB . Furthermore , inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase pathway by the treatments with ET receptor antagonists and siRNA was also observed . These results indicate that endothelin signalling may , in part , play important roles in cell growth in SCCs through the MAP kinase pathway .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22139427	Pancreatic cancer remains the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States . Potent therapeutic strategies are urgently needed for pancreatic cancer . Cucurmosin is a novel type1 ribosome-inactivating protein ( RIP ) isolated from the sarcocarp of Cucurbita moschata ( pumpkin ) . Due to its cytotoxicity , cucurmosin can inhibit tumor cell proliferation through induction of apoptosis on tumor cells , but the specific mechanism is still unclear . We explored the function of cucurmosin in BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells using multiple cellular and molecular approaches such as 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay , flow cytometry , reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , Western blotting and transmission electron microscopy for observing typical changes and formation of apoptotic bodies . We found that cucurmosin inhibited the proliferation of BxPC-3 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner , and increased the cell population in the G0-G1 phase . With increasing concentration of cucurmosin , the expression of EGFR , p-PI3K , Akt , p-Akt , mTOR , p-mTOR , P70S6K-Î± , p-P70S6K-Î± , 4E-BP1 and p-4E-BP1 at the protein level was decreased , whereas the expression of p-Bad and caspase-9 was elevated . However , the mRNA expression of EGFR did not change . These findings suggest that cucurmosin can down-regulate the expression of EGFR by targeting . Cucurmosin induces the apoptosis of BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway .	sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death
22146344	Previous studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs ) enhance cell survival through upregulation and secretion of stanniocalcin-1 ( STC1 ) . This study shows that MSC-derived STC1 promotes survival of lung cancer cells by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation , reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , and shifting metabolism towards a more glycolytic metabolic profile . MSC-derived STC1 upregulated uncoupling protein 2 ( UCP2 ) in injured A549 cells in an STC1-dependent manner . Knockdown of UCP2 reduced the ability of MSCs and recombinant STC1 ( rSTC1 ) to reduce cell death in the A549 population. rSTC1-treated A549 cells displayed decreased levels of ROS , mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP ) , and increased lactate production , all of which were dependent on the upregulation of UCP2 . Our data suggest that MSCs can promote cell survival by regulating mitochondrial respiration via STC1 .	cellular energetics;tumor promoting inflammation
22201186	Recent evidences suggest that the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 ( GSK3 ) contributes to the tumorigenic potential of pancreatic cancer cells through modulation of cell proliferation and survival . However , further investigations are needed to identify GSK3-dependent mechanisms involved in the control of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival . This study was undertaken to provide further support for a role of GSK3 in pancreatic cancer cell growth as well as to identify new cellular and molecular mechanisms involved . Herein , we demonstrate that prolonged inhibition of GSK3 triggers an apoptotic response only in human pancreatic cancer cells but not in human non-transformed pancreatic epithelial cells . We show that prolonged inhibition of GSK3 activity increases Bim messenger RNA and protein expressions . Moreover , we provide evidence that activation of the c-jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) pathway is necessary for the GSK3 inhibition-mediated increase in Bim expression and apoptotic response . Finally , we demonstrate that concomitant inhibition of GSK3 potentiates the death ligand-induced apoptotic response in pancreatic cancer cells but not in non-transformed pancreatic epithelial cells and that this effect also requires JNK activity . Considering that different approaches leading to stimulation of death receptor signaling are under clinical trials for treatment of unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer , inhibition of GSK3 could represent an attractive new avenue to improve their effectiveness .	resisting cell death
22226043	BACKGROUND The receptor tyrosine kinase family includes many transmembrane proteins with diverse physiological and pathophysiological functions . The involvement of tyrosine kinase signaling in promoting a more aggressive tumor phenotype within the context of chemotherapeutic evasion is gaining recognition . The Ron receptor is a tyrosine kinase receptor that has been implicated in the progression of breast cancer and evasion of tamoxifen therapy . RESULTS Here , we report that Ron expression is correlated with in situ , estrogen receptor alpha ( ERÎ±)-positive tumors , and is higher in breast tumors following neoadjuvant tamoxifen therapy . We also demonstrate that the majority of mammary tumors isolated from transgenic mice with mammary specific-Ron overexpression ( MMTV-Ron mice ) , exhibit appreciable ER expression . Moreover , genetic-ablation of ERÎ± , in the context of Ron overexpression , leads to delayed mammary tumor initiation and growth , but also results in an increased metastasis . CONCLUSIONS Ron receptor overexpression is associated with ERÎ±-positive human and murine breast tumors . In addition , loss of ERÎ± on a Ron overexpressing background in mice leads to the development of breast tumors which grow slower but which exhibit more metastasis and suggests that targeting of ERÎ± , as in the case of tamoxifen therapy , may reduce the growth of Ron overexpressing breast cancers but may cause these tumors to be more metastatic .	sustaining proliferative signaling;activating invasion and metastasis
22232214	Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) results from a chromosomal translocation in hematopoietic stem or early progenitor cells that gives rise to the oncogenic BCR/ABL fusion protein . Clinically , CML has a chronic phase that eventually evolves into an accelerated stage and blast crisis . A CML-specific immune response is thought to contribute to the control of disease . Whether the immune system can also promote disease progression is not known . In the present study , we investigated the possibility that the TNF receptor family member CD27 is present on leukemia stem cells ( LSCs ) and mediates effects of the immune system on CML . In a mouse model of CML , BCR/ABL+ LSCs and leukemia progenitor cells were found to express CD27 . Binding of CD27 by its ligand , CD70 , increased expression of Wnt target genes in LSCs by enhancing nuclear localization of active Î²-catenin and TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase ( TNIK ) . This resulted in increased proliferation and differentiation of LSCs . Blocking CD27 signaling in LSCs delayed disease progression and prolonged survival . Furthermore , CD27 was expressed on CML stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow of CML patients , and CD27 signaling promoted growth of BCR/ABL+ human leukemia cells by activating the Wnt pathway . Since expression of CD70 is limited to activated lymphocytes and dendritic cells , our results reveal a mechanism by which adaptive immunity contributes to leukemia progression . In addition , targeting CD27 on LSCs may represent an attractive therapeutic approach to blocking the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway in CML .	tumor promoting inflammation
22252523	Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women , and many breast cancer patients fail conventional treatment strategies of chemotherapy , radiation , and antiestrogen therapy . Research into the molecular pathways and biomarkers involved in the development of breast cancer should yield information that will guide therapeutic decisions . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) are involved in the carcinogenesis of breast cancer and exist tight crosstalk with estrogen receptor ( ER ) pathway . Combination of EGFR and COX-2 inhibitors , therefore , could be an effective strategy for reducing cell growth in estrogen-dependent breast cancer . In order to verify the effects of EGFR and COX-2 inhibitors , breast cancer cells MCF-7 and SKBR-3 were characterized for receptors status and then treated with respective inhibitors ( nimotuzumab and celecoxib ) alone and in combination . Both cell lines were sensitive to celecoxib , but not to nimotuzumab . However , combination of two drugs demonstrated synergistic effects on cell killing . Moreover , association of two drugs resulted in SKBR-3 cells , a further G0/G1 phase arrest than one drug alone . Downregulation of p-EGFR , p-Akt , p-mTOR , and amplified in breast cancer 1 ( AIB1 ) were observed in both cell lines , and upregulation of E-cadherin was only found in MCF-7 , after treatment with single agent or in combination . These studies suggest that nimotuzumab and celecoxib exert synergistic antiproliferation effects in breast cancer , which partly correlates with ER status . Due to Akt/mTOR , EMT and AIB1 pathways participate in this process , therefore , E-cadherin and AIB1 may be considered as possible biomarkers to predict response in ER-positive breast cancer cells treated with EGFR and COX-2 inhibitors .	resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling
22269172	BACKGROUND Luteolin is a 3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone found in various fruits and vegetables . We have shown previously that luteolin reduces HT-29 cell growth by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest . The objective of this study was to examine whether luteolin downregulates the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor ( IGF-IR ) signaling pathway in HT-29 cells . METHODS In order to assess the effects of luteolin and/or IGF-I on the IGF-IR signaling pathway , cells were cultured with or without 60 Î¼mol/L luteolin and/or 10 nmol/L IGF-I . Cell proliferation , DNA synthesis , and IGF-IR mRNA levels were evaluated by a cell viability assay , [ 3H]thymidine incorporation assays , and real-time polymerase chain reaction , respectively . Western blot analyses , immunoprecipitation , and in vitro kinase assays were conducted to evaluate the secretion of IGF-II , the protein expression and activation of IGF-IR , and the association of the p85 subunit of phophatidylinositol-3 kinase ( PI3K ) with IGF-IR , the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK)1/2 , and cell division cycle 25c ( CDC25c ) , and PI3K activity . RESULTS Luteolin ( 0 - 60 Î¼mol/L ) dose-dependently reduced the IGF-II secretion of HT-29 cells . IGF-I stimulated HT-29 cell growth but did not abrogate luteolin-induced growth inhibition . Luteolin reduced the levels of the IGF-IR precursor protein and IGF-IR transcripts . Luteolin reduced the IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-IR and the association of p85 with IGF-IR . Additionally , luteolin inhibited the activity of PI3K activity as well as the phosphorylation of Akt , ERK1/2 , and CDC25c in the presence and absence of IGF-I stimulation . CONCLUSIONS The present results demonstrate that luteolin downregulates the activation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways via a reduction in IGF-IR signaling in HT-29 cells ; this may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the observed luteolin-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest .	sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death
22275356	Cancer cells universally increase glucose and glutamine consumption , leading to the altered metabolic state known as the Warburg effect ; one metabolic pathway , highly dependent on glucose and glutamine , is the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway . Increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway leads to increases in the post-translational addition of O-linked Î²-N-acetylglucosamine ( O-GlcNAc ) to various nuclear and cytosolic proteins . A number of these target proteins are implicated in cancer , and recently , O-GlcNAcylation was shown to play a role in breast cancer ; however , O-GlcNAcylation in other cancers remains poorly defined . Here , we show that O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT ) is overexpressed in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate epithelium and that OGT protein and O-GlcNAc levels are elevated in prostate carcinoma cell lines . Reducing O-GlcNAcylation in PC3-ML cells was associated with reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-2 , MMP-9 , and VEGF , resulting in inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis . OGT-mediated regulation of invasion and angiogenesis was dependent upon regulation of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1 , a key regulator of invasion and angiogenesis , as reducing OGT expression led to increased FoxM1 protein degradation . Conversely , overexpression of a degradation-resistant FoxM1 mutant abrogated OGT RNAi-mediated effects on invasion , MMP levels , angiogenesis , and VEGF expression . Using a mouse model of metastasis , we found that reduction of OGT expression blocked bone metastasis . Altogether , these data suggest that as prostate cancer cells alter glucose and glutamine levels , O-GlcNAc modifications and OGT levels become elevated and are required for regulation of malignant properties , implicating OGT as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis;inducing angiogenesis
22284893	The NF-kB family of transcription factors regulates important biological functions including cell growth , survival and the immune response . We found that Human Papillomavirus type 16 ( HPV-16 ) E7 and E6/E7 proteins inhibited basal and TNF-alpha-inducible NF-kB activity in human epithelial cells cultured from the cervical transformation zone , the anatomic region where most cervical cancers develop . In contrast , HPV-16 E6 regulated NF-kB in a cell type- and cell growth-dependent manner . NF-kB influenced immortalization of cervical cells by HPV16 . Inhibition of NF-kB by an IkB alpha repressor mutant increased colony formation and immortalization by HPV-16 . In contrast , activation of NF-kB by constitutive expression of p65 inhibited proliferation and immortalization . Our results suggest that inhibition of NF-kB by HPV-16 E6/E7 contributes to immortalization of cells from the cervical transformation zone .	enabling replicative immortality
22285130	High-grade gliomas ( HGG ) , are the most common aggressive brain tumours in adults . Inhibitors targeting growth factor signalling pathways in glioma have shown a low clinical response rate . To accurately evaluate response to targeted therapies further in vitro studies are necessary . Growth factor pathway expression using epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , mutant EGFR ( EGFRvIII ) , platelet derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) , C-Kit and C-Abl together with phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) expression and downstream activation of AKT and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 ( P70S6K ) was analysed in 26 primary glioma cultures treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) erlotinib , gefitinib and imatinib . Response to TKIs was assessed using 50% inhibitory concentrations ( IC(50) ) . Response for each culture was compared with the EGFR/PDGFR immunocytochemical pathway profile using hierarchical cluster analysis ( HCA ) and principal component analysis ( PCA ) . Erlotinib response was not strongly associated with high expression of the growth factor pathway components . PTEN expression did not correlate with response to any of the three TKIs . Increased EGFR expression was associated with gefitinib response ; increased PDGFR-Î± expression was associated with imatinib response . The results of this in vitro study suggest gefitinib and imatinib may have therapeutic potential in HGG tumours with a corresponding growth factor receptor expression profile .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22293713	Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) amplification occurs in over 30% of esophageal carcinomas . Combination therapies with EGFR and HER2-targeting agents and cytotoxic agents are considered a potential therapeutic option for esophageal cancer . We evaluated the antitumor effects of lapatinib , a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor which simultaneously inhibits EGFR and HER2 , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-Fu ) alone and in combination on esophageal cancer cells . The antiproliferative activity of lapatinib , 5-Fu and lapatinib plus 5-Fu was measured by MTT assay and the combination index ( CI ) values were calculated . Additionally , cell cycle distribution of lapatinib alone and the combination with 5-Fu were detected by flow cytometry analysis . AnnexinV-FITC and propidium iodide stain were used for analyzing the apoptotic cells after cells were treated with either agent alone or in combination . The EGFR and HER2 activated signaling pathways were monitored by western blotting . The combination of lapatinib and 5-Fu synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect on esophageal cancer cells . The potentiation effect of combined treatment was associated with downregulation of EGFR and HER2 signaling pathways because data from western blot analysis showed that lapatinib in combination with 5-Fu markedly reduced the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2 , and inhibited the activation of downstream signaling molecules , such as AKT and ERK . A significant G1 arrest was also observed in cell cycle analysis after exposing cells to lapatinib , however , combination with 5-Fu did not enhance G1 arrest . These results indicate that the combination of the lapatinib and 5-Fu is a promising treatment option for esophageal carcinoma with HER2 amplification .	resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling
22318307	D-Limonene , a common monoterepene has been shown to have antiproliferative , apoptosis-inducing and chemopreventive effects . In the present study , we have investigated the effects of D-limonene on the growth of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene ( DMBA)-initiated and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-promoted skin tumor development . We found that D-limonene ( 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight ) treatments to the mouse skin significantly reduced the TPA-induced ( a ) edema and hyperplasia ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) ; ( b ) expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ; ( c ) ornithine decarboxylase activity ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) ; and ( d ) [ (3)H ] thymidine incorporation into DNA ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) . In addition , treatment of D-limonene effectively restored the level of reduced glutathione , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione reductase , glutathione S-transferase , catalase and malondialdehyde production in TPA-treated mouse skin . In a two-stage skin tumorigenesis study , D-limonene significantly reduced the tumor burden ( p &lt ; 0.005 ) and tumor incidence as compared to DMBA/TPA-treated mice . D-Limonene treatment also extended the latency period of tumor development from 4 to 9 weeks . D-Limonene treatment decreased the expression level of Ras , Raf and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 in DMBA/TPA-induced tumors . A decrease in the expression of Bcl-2 and an increase in Bax expression were also observed in tumor tissues of mice treated with D-limonene . Taken together , our findings suggest that D-limonene may exert its chemopreventive activity through the inhibition of inflammation , oxidative stress and Ras-signaling as well as the induction of pro-apoptotic state during TPA-mediated promotion of DMBA-induced skin cancer in mouse model .	tumor promoting inflammation;resisting cell death
22320183	The Warburg effect describes a heightened propensity of tumor cells to produce lactic acid in the presence or absence of O(2) . A generally held notion is that the Warburg effect is related to energy . Using whole-genome , proteomic MALDI-TOF-MS and metabolite analysis , we investigated the Warburg effect in malignant neuroblastoma N2a cells . The findings show that the Warburg effect serves a functional role in regulating acidic pericellular pH ( pHe ) , which is mediated by metabolic inversion or a fluctuating dominance between glycolytic-rate substrate level phosphorylation ( SLP ) and mitochondrial ( mt ) oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) to control lactic acid production . The results also show that an alkaline pHe caused an elevation in SLP/OXPHOS ratio ( approximately 98% SLP/OXPHOS ) ; while the ratio was approximately 56% at neutral pHe and approximately 93% in acidic pHe . Acidic pHe paralleled greater expression of mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS genes , such as complex III-V ( Uqcr10 , Atp5 and Cox7c ) , mt Fmc1 , Romo1 , Tmem 173 , Tomm6 , aldehyde dehydrogenase , mt Sod2 mt biogenesis component PPAR-γ co-activator 1 adjunct to loss of mt fission ( Mff ) . Moreover , acidic pHe corresponded to metabolic efficiency evidenced by a rise in mTOR nutrient sensor GβL , its downstream target ( Eif4ebp1 ) , insulin modulators ( Trib3 and Fetub ) and loss of catabolic ( Hadhb , Bdh1 and Pygl)/glycolytic processes ( aldolase C , pyruvate kinase , Nampt and aldose-reductase ) . In contrast , alkaline pHe initiated loss of mitofusin 2 , complex II-IV ( Sdhaf1 , Uqcrq , Cox4i2 and Aldh1l2 ) , aconitase , mitochondrial carrier triple repeat 1 and mt biosynthetic ( Coq2 , Coq5 and Coq9 ) . In conclusion , the Warburg effect might serve as a negative feedback loop that regulates the pHe toward a broad acidic range by altering lactic acid production through inversion of metabolic systems . These effects were independent of changes in O(2) concentration or glucose supply .	cellular energetics
22322523	OBJECTIVES To investigate the immunoexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in a sample of oral leukoplakias ( OL ) and to determine the receptor ' s association with dysplasia , tobacco consumption , lesion site , and proliferation rate . Although EGFR should be overexpressed in some oral leukoplakias , the factors that may interfere with this expression and the influence of this receptor on epithelial proliferation have yet to be investigated . STUDY DESIGN Samples of oral leukoplakias ( 48 ) and of normal oral epithelium ( 10 ) were immunohistologically examined for expression of EGFR . Immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 , and p27 were also performed in leukoplakias . EGFR expression was associated with clinical and pathological features . RESULTS EGFR was positive in 62.5% of the leukoplakias and 50% of normal oral epithelium . The number of EGFR positive OL located in high-risk sites was significantly higher than EGFR positive OL located in low-risk sites . Most of the p27 negative leukoplakias were EGFR positive , and the p27 index in the parabasal layer was diminished in the presence of dysplasia . Positivity for EGFR was not associated with dysplasia , tobacco exposure , or Ki-67 . CONCLUSION EGFR is expressed in leukoplakia regardless of dysplasia , but EGFR positivity should be more frequent in lesions sited in areas of high cancer risk . The association between EGFR and p27 may represent an important mechanism in the control of cellular proliferation and malignant progression of oral epithelium and therefore warrants further investigation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22341523	Whereas estrogen-estrogen receptor Î± ( ER ) signaling plays an important role in breast cancer growth , it is also necessary for the differentiation of normal breast epithelial cells . How this functional conversion occurs , however , remains unknown . Based on a genome-wide sequencing study that identified mutations in several breast cancer genes , we examined some of the genes for mutations , expression levels , and functional effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenesis . We present the data for C1orf64 or ER-related factor ( ERRF ) from 31 cell lines and 367 primary breast cancer tumors . Whereas mutation of ERRF was infrequent ( 1 of 79 or 1.3% ) , its expression was up-regulated in breast cancer , and the up-regulation was more common in lower-stage tumors . In addition , increased ERRF expression was significantly associated with ER and/or progesterone receptor ( PR ) positivity , which was still valid in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2)-negative tumors . In ER-positive tumors , ERRF expression was inversely correlated with HER2 status . Furthermore , higher ERRF protein expression was significantly associated with better disease-free survival and overall survival , particularly in ER- and/or PR-positive and HER2-negative tumors ( luminal A subtype ) . Functionally , knockdown of ERRF in two ER-positive breast cancer cell lines , T-47D and MDA-MB-361 , suppressed cell growth in vitro and tumorigenesis in xenograft models . These results suggest that ERRF plays a role in estrogen-ER-mediated growth of breast cancer cells and could , thus , be a potential therapeutic target .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22347418	Estrogens play essential roles in the progression of mammary and prostatic diseases . The transcriptional effects of estrogens are transduced by two estrogen receptors , ERÎ± and ERÎ² , which elicit opposing roles in regulating proliferation : ERÎ± is proliferative while ERÎ² is anti-proliferative . Exogenous expression of ERÎ² in ERÎ±-positive cancer cell lines inhibits cell proliferation in response to estrogen and reduces xenografted tumor growth in vivo , suggesting that ERÎ² might oppose ERÎ±'s proliferative effects via formation of ERÎ±/Î² heterodimers . Despite biochemical and cellular evidence of ERÎ±/Î² heterodimer formation in cells co-expressing both receptors , the biological roles of the ERÎ±/Î² heterodimer remain to be elucidated . Here we report the identification of two phytoestrogens that selectively activate ERÎ±/Î² heterodimers at specific concentrations using a cell-based , two-step high throughput small molecule screen for ER transcriptional activity and ER dimer selectivity . Using ERÎ±/Î² heterodimer-selective ligands at defined concentrations , we demonstrate that ERÎ±/Î² heterodimers are growth inhibitory in breast and prostate cells which co-express the two ER isoforms . Furthermore , using Automated Quantitative Analysis ( AQUA ) to examine nuclear expression of ERÎ± and ERÎ² in human breast tissue microarrays , we demonstrate that ERÎ± and ERÎ² are co-expressed in the same cells in breast tumors . The co-expression of ERÎ± and ERÎ² in the same cells supports the possibility of ERÎ±/Î² heterodimer formation at physio- and pathological conditions , further suggesting that targeting ERÎ±/Î² heterodimers might be a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of cancers which co-express ERÎ± and ERÎ² .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22366308	An acquired mutation ( T790M ) in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) accounts for half of all relapses in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients who initially respond to EGFR kinase inhibitors . In this study , we demonstrated for the first time that EGFR-T790M interacts with the cytoskeletal components , myosin heavy chain 9 ( MYH9 ) and Î²-actin , in the nucleus of H1975 cells carrying the T790M-mutant EGFR . The interactions of EGFR with MYH9 and Î²-actin were reduced in the presence of blebbistatin , a specific inhibitor for the MYH9-Î²-actin interaction , suggesting that the EGFR interaction with MYH9 and Î²-actin is affected by the integrity of the cytoskeleton . These physical interactions among MYH9 , Î²-actin , and EGFR were also impaired by CL-387,785 , a kinase inhibitor for EGFR-T790M . Furthermore , CL-387,785 and blebbistatin interacted in a synergistic fashion to suppress cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in H1975 cells . The combination of CL-387,785 and blebbistatin enhanced the down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) , a transcriptional target of nuclear EGFR . Overall , our findings demonstrate that disrupting EGFR interactions with the cytoskeletal components enhanced the anti-cancer effects of CL-387,785 against H1975 cells , suggesting a novel therapeutic approach for NSCLC cells that express the drug-resistant EGFR-T790M .	sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death
22407299	It has been shown that regulation of EGFR expression in prostate cancer cells is mostly at the transcriptional level. microRNA-133 ( miR-133 ) has long been recognized as a muscle-specific miRNA which may regulate myoblast differentiation and participate in many myogenic diseases . Recently , it has been reported that miR-133 is also involved in other tumors , such as bladder cancer , esophageal cancer and may regulate cell motility in these cancer cells . In the present study , we examined the expression and effects of miR-133 in two hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines . The expression of miR-133a and miR-133b were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR . After transfection of miR-133a and miR-133b , cell viability assay , luciferase assay , western blot analysis , cell migration and invasion assay were conducted in Du145 and PC3 cells . In this study , we showed that miRâ133a and miR-133b are expressed at the detection limit in two hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines , PC3 and DU145 . Ectopic expression of miR-133 inhibited cell proliferation , migration and invasion in these cells . We also provide the first evidence that miR-133 may target EGFR . Our study provided the first glimpse of the functional role of miR-133 in two hormone-independent prostate cancer cell lines . These results may add to our knowledge on the molecular basis of prostate cancer progression .	activating invasion and metastasis;sustaining proliferative signaling
22422053	Stable ectopic expression of Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase is usually performed in interleukin 3 ( IL-3)-dependent murine cell lines like Ba/F3 , resulting in loss of IL-3 dependence . Such high-level Flt3 expression has to date not been reported in human acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cell lines , despite the fact that oncogenic Flt3 aberrancies are frequent in AML patients . We show here that ectopic Flt3 expression in different human cancer cell lines might reduce proliferation and induce apoptotic cell death , involving Bax/Bcl2 modulation . Selective depletion of Flt3-expressing cells occurred in human AML cell lines transduced with retroviral Flt3 constructs , shown here using the HL-60 leukemic cell line . Flt3 expression was investigated in two cellular model systems , the SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cell line and the human embryonic kidney HEK293 cell line , and proliferation was reduced in both systems . HEK293 cells underwent apoptosis upon ectopic Flt3 expression and cell death could be rescued by overexpression of Bcl-2 . Furthermore , we observed that the Flt3-induced inhibition of proliferation in HL-60 cells appeared to be Bax-dependent . Our results thus suggest that excessive Flt3 expression has growth-suppressive properties in several human cancer cell lines .	resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling
22431524	Cancer cells exhibit altered glucose metabolism characterized by a preference for aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect , and the cells resist matrix detachment-induced apoptosis , which is called anoikis , a barrier to metastasis . It remains largely unclear whether tumor metabolism influences anoikis and metastasis . Here we show that when detached from the matrix , untransformed mammary epithelial cells undergo metabolic reprogramming by markedly upregulating pyruvate dehydrogenase ( PDH ) kinase 4 ( PDK4 ) through estrogen-related receptor gamma ( ERRγ ) , thereby inhibiting PDH and attenuating the flux of glycolytic carbon into mitochondrial oxidation . To decipher the significance of this metabolic response , we found that depletion of PDK4 or activation of PDH increased mitochondrial respiration and oxidative stress in suspended cells , resulting in heightened anoikis . Conversely , overexpression of PDKs prolonged survival of cells in suspension . Therefore , decreased glucose oxidation following cell detachment confers anoikis resistance . Unlike untransformed cells , most cancer cells demonstrate reduced glucose oxidation even under attached conditions , and thus they inherently possess a survival advantage when suspended . Normalization of glucose metabolism by stimulating PDH in cancer cells restores their susceptibility to anoikis and impairs their metastatic potential . These results suggest that the Warburg effect , more specifically , diminished glucose oxidation , promotes anoikis resistance and metastasis and that PDKs are potential targets for antimetastasis therapy .	cellular energetics;sustaining proliferative signaling;activating invasion and metastasis
22443054	OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of CdTe QDs ( cadmium telluride quantum dots ) on oxidative stress and DNA damage of liver cells in mice . METHODS Thirty ICR male mice were randomly divided into 5 groups : one negative control ( normal saline ) group . Three CdTe QDs groups ( exposed by intravenous injection of 0.2 ml of CdTe QDs at the concentration of 3.75 , 37.5 and 375 nmol/ml respectively ) for electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) test , and another positive control group ( exposed by intravenous injection of 0.2 ml of cyclophosphamide 20 mg/ml ) for single cell gel electrophoresis ( SCGE ) test . All mice were decapitated 24h after the injection , free radicals and DNA damage of liver cells were detected by EPR and SCGE . RESULTS The levels of oxygen free radicals detected by EPR were increased with the increase of CdTe QDs . The tail length , olive tail moment , tail DNA ( % ) and the ratio of tail/head examined by SCGE were also increased with the increase of the dosage of CdTe QDs ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) . CONCLUSION CdTe QDs could induce oxidative stress and DNA damage of liver cells in mice with a dose-effect relationship .	tumor promoting inflammation;genomic instability and mutation
22479563	Carboxypeptidase M ( CPM ) targets the basic amino acids arginine and lysine present at the C-terminus of peptides or proteins . CPM is thought to be involved in inflammatory processes . This is corroborated by CPM-mediated trimming and modulation of inflammatory factors , and expression of the protease in inflammatory environments . Since the function of CPM in and beyond inflammation remains mainly undefined , the identification of natural substrates can aid in discovering the ( patho)physiological role of CPM . CCL1/I-309 , with its three C-terminal basic amino acids , forms a potential natural substrate for CPM . CCL1 plays a role not only in inflammation but also in apoptosis , angiogenesis and tumor biology . Enzymatic processing differently impacts the biological activity of chemokines thereby contributing to the complex regulation of the chemokine system . The aim of the present study was to investigate whether ( i ) CCL1/I-309 is prone to trimming by CPM , and ( ii ) the biological activity of CCL1 is altered after C-terminal proteolytic processing . CCL1 was identified as a novel substrate for CPM in vitro using mass spectrometry . C-terminal clipping of CCL1 augmented intracellular calcium release mediated by CCR8 but reduced the binding of CCL1 to CCR8 . In line with the higher intracellular calcium release , a pronounced increase of the anti-apoptotic activity of CCL1 was observed in the BW5147 cellular model . CCR8 signaling , CCR8 binding and anti-apoptotic activity were unaffected when CPM was exposed to the carboxypeptidase inhibitor DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropanoic acid . The results of this study suggest that CPM is a likely candidate for the regulation of biological processes relying on the CCL1-CCR8 system .	resisting cell death
22541785	AIM We studied expression of molecules of the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) pathway and its relation to vascularization , cell proliferation and patient outcome in recurring non-anaplastic meningioma . We studied 29 tumor specimens of 8 patients with recurring meningiomas and of 8 age- and gender-matched control patients with non-recurring meningiomas ( including meningothelial , transitional , fibroblastic and atypical subtypes ) using immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization . RESULTS VEGF protein , VEGF-mRNA , VEGF receptor ( VEGFR)-1 mRNA , VEGFR-2 mRNA and hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF)-1-Î± protein were expressed in 27/29 ( 93% ) , 20/27 ( 74% ) , 9/27 ( 33.3% ) , 12/27 ( 44.4% ) and 5/29 ( 17.2% ) specimens , respectively . VEGFR- 2 mRNA expression was found in 6/8 tumors extracted at first operation in patients with recurring tumors and in none of the control cases ( p = 0.007 ) . Microvessel density ( MVD ) and Ki-67 index values were generally higher in meningiomas with expression of angiogenic factors . The association of high Ki-67 index values with VEGF-mRNA expression was significant ( p = 0.04 ) . Time to recurrence was shorter in patients with high MVD than in patients with low MVD ( p = 0.027 ) . CONCLUSIONS High MVD correlates with unfavorable prognosis in our series of recurring meningioma . VEGF and its receptors are frequently expressed in meningiomas and seem important for tumor growth and recurrence . Thus , anti-VEGF therapy in aggressive meningioma seems rational from a pathobiological point of view .	inducing angiogenesis
22552284	The phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K)/AKT and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways are activated in a wide range of human cancers . In many cases , concomitant inhibition of both pathways is necessary to block proliferation and induce cell death and tumor shrinkage . Several feedback systems have been described in which inhibition of one intracellular pathway leads to activation of a parallel signaling pathway , thereby decreasing the effectiveness of single-agent targeted therapies . In this study , we describe a feedback mechanism in which MEK inhibition leads to activation of PI3K/AKT signaling in EGFR and HER2-driven cancers . We found that MEK inhibitor-induced activation of PI3K/AKT resulted from hyperactivation of ERBB3 as a result of the loss of an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation in the conserved juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2 . Mutation of this amino acid led to increased ERBB receptor activation and upregulation of the ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway , which was no longer responsive to MEK inhibition . Taken together , these results elucidate an important , dominant feedback network regulating central oncogenic pathways in human cancer .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22554915	BACKGROUND Apigenin , a natural plant flavone , may have chemopreventive and therapeutic potentials for anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , and anti-cancer . Nevertheless , the anti-tumor effect of apigenin on human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) is not fully understood . METHODS The antioxidant capacity and protective effects of apigenin against oxidative stress in murine normal embryonic liver BNLCL2 cells are examined . Cell viability , morphologic change , clonogenic survival , cell cycle distribution , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , glutathione formation , and death receptors- and Bcl-2-mediated caspase pathways of HNSCC SCC25 cells and A431 cells with apigenin are investigated . RESULTS Apigenin inhibits the growth of SCC25 and A431 cells and induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase . Apigenin has an antioxidant capacity as well as the ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation . It protects BNLCL2 cells against oxidative damage , and is potentially able to prevent cancer . Apigenin increases intracellular ROS levels and reduces levels of glutathione ; it also induces cell apoptosis via tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNF-R)- , TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor ( TRAIL-R)- , and Bcl-2-mediated caspase-dependent cell death pathways in SCC25 cells . The combination of apigenin with 5-fluorouracil ( 5-Fu ) or cisplatin induces the dramatic death of SCC25 cells . CONCLUSIONS Apigenin induces SCC25 cell apoptosis via the up-regulation of both TNF-R and TRAIL-R signaling pathways , and has a synergistic effect on the inhibition of cell proliferation in combination with 5-Fu or cisplatin . GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE These analytical findings suggest that apigenin may be a good therapeutic agent against HNSCC cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling;tumor promoting inflammation;genomic instability and mutation;resisting cell death
22577350	Surgery is the most effective therapy for cancer in the United States , but disease still recurs in more than 40% of patients within 5 years after resection . Chemotherapy is given postoperatively to prevent relapses ; however , this approach has had marginal success . After surgery , recurrent tumors depend on rapid neovascular proliferation to deliver nutrients and oxygen . Phosphatidylserine ( PS ) is exposed on the vascular endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment but is notably absent on blood vessels in normal tissues . Thus , PS is an attractive target for cancer therapy after surgery . Syngeneic mice bearing TC1 lung cancer tumors were treated with mch1N11 ( a novel mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets PS ) , cisplatin ( cis ) , or combination after surgery . Tumor relapses and disease progression were decreased 90% by combination therapy compared with a 50% response rate for cis alone ( P = .02 ) . Mice receiving postoperative mch1N11 had no wound-related complications or added systemic toxicity in comparison to control animals . Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the effects of mch1N11 were associated with a dense infiltration of inflammatory cells , particularly granulocytes . This strategy was independent of the adaptive immune system . Together , these data suggest that vascular-targeted strategies directed against exposed PS may be a powerful adjunct to postoperative chemotherapy in preventing relapses after cancer surgery .	tumor promoting inflammation;inducing angiogenesis
22593586	"High glycolysis , well known as "" Warburg effect, "" is frequently observed in a variety of cancers . Whether the deregulation of miRNAs contributes to the Warburg effect remains largely unknown . Because miRNA regulates gene expression at both mRNA and protein levels , we constructed a gene functional association network , which allows us to detect the gene activity instead of gene expression , to integratively analyze the microarray data for gene expression and miRNA expression profiling and identify glycolysis-related gene-miRNA pairs deregulated in cancer . Hexokinase 2 ( HK2 ) , coding for the first rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis , is among the top list of genes predicted and potentially regulated by multiple miRNAs including miR-143 . Interestingly , miR-143 expression was inversely associated with HK2 protein level but not mRNA level in human lung cancer samples. miR-143 , down-regulated by mammalian target of rapamycin activation , reduces glucose metabolism and inhibits cancer cell proliferation and tumor formation through targeting HK2 . Collectively , we have not only established a novel methodology for gene-miRNA pair prediction but also identified miR-143 as an essential regulator of cancer glycolysis via targeting HK2 ."	cellular energetics
22615145	The effects of 17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) are mediated through activation of estrogen receptors ( ER ) : ERalpha and ERbeta . It is known that ERalpha/ERbeta ratio is higher in breast tumors than in normal tissue . Since antioxidant enzymes and uncoupling proteins ( UCPs ) are reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production and mitochondrial biogenesis regulators , our aim was to study the E2-effect on oxidative stress , antioxidant enzyme expression , and UCPs in breast cancer cell lines with different ERalpha/ERbeta ratios . The lower ERalpha/ERbeta ratio T47D cell line showed low ROS production and high UCP5 levels . However , the higher ERalpha/ERbeta ratio MCF-7 cell line showed an up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes and UCPs , yet exhibited high oxidative stress . As a result , a decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities and UCP2 protein levels , coupled with an increase in oxidative damage was found . On the whole , these results show different E2-effects on oxidative stress regulation , modulating UCPs , and antioxidant enzymes , which were ERalpha/ERbeta ratio dependent in breast cancer cell lines .	sustaining proliferative signaling;tumor promoting inflammation;genomic instability and mutation
22623369	Targeting receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) degradation may be an interesting approach to reduce RTK cell signaling in cancer cells . Here we show that increasing E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B-lineage lymphoma ( c-Cbl ) expression using lentiviral infection decreased osteosarcoma cell replication and survival and reduced cell migration and invasion in murine and human osteosarcoma cells . Conversely , c-Cbl inhibition using short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) increased osteosarcoma cell growth and survival , as well as invasion and migration , indicating that c-Cbl plays a critical role as a bone tumor suppressor . Importantly , the anticancer effect of increasing c-Cbl expression in osteosarcoma cells was related mainly to the downregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRÎ± ) . In a murine bone tumor model , increasing c-Cbl expression also reduced RTK expression , resulting in decreased tumor cell proliferation and survival and reduced tumor growth . Interestingly , increasing c-Cbl also markedly reduced lung metastasis in mice . Tissue microarray analysis revealed that low c-Cbl protein expression is associated with elevated EGFR and PDGFRÎ± protein levels in human osteosarcoma with poor outcome . This study shows that increasing c-Cbl expression reduces osteosarcoma cell growth , survival , and metastasis in part through downregulation of RTKs , which supports the potential therapeutic interest of targeting c-Cbl in malignant bone diseases involving increased RTK .	activating invasion and metastasis;sustaining proliferative signaling
22685175	Adults and children with high-risk CRLF2-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) respond poorly to current cytotoxic chemotherapy and suffer unacceptably high rates of relapse , supporting the need to use alternative therapies . CRLF2 encodes the thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP ) receptor , which activates cell signaling in normal lymphocytes on binding its ligand , TSLP . We hypothesized that aberrant cell signaling occurs in CRLF2-rearranged ALL and can be targeted by signal transduction inhibitors of this pathway . In a large number of primary CRLF2-rearranged ALL samples , we observed increased basal levels of pJAK2 , pSTAT5 , and pS6 . We thus characterized the biochemical sequelae of CRLF2 and JAK alterations in CRLF2-rearranged ALL primary patient samples via analysis of TSLP-mediated signal transduction . TSLP stimulation of these leukemias further induced robust JAK/STAT and PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling . JAK inhibition abrogated phosphorylation of JAK/STAT and , surprisingly , of PI3K/mTOR pathway members , suggesting an interconnection between these signaling networks and providing a rationale for testing JAK inhibitors in clinical trials . The PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors rapamycin , PI103 , and PP242 also inhibited activated signal transduction and translational machinery proteins of the PI3K/mTOR pathway , suggesting that signal transduction inhibitors targeting this pathway also may have therapeutic relevance for patients with CRLF2-rearranged ALL and merit further preclinical testing .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22707516	OBJECTIVE Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is a highly vascularized tumor in which neoangiogenesis contributes to growth and metastasis . We assessed the safety , efficacy , and potential biomarkers of activity of bevacizumab in patients with advanced HCC . METHODS In this phase II trial , eligible patients received bevacizumab , 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks . The disease-control rate at 16 weeks ( 16W-DCR ) was the primary endpoint . Circulating endothelial cells ( CECs ) and plasma cytokines and angiogenic factors ( CAFs ) were measured at baseline and throughout treatment . RESULTS The 16W-DCR was 42% ( 95% confidence interval , 27%-57% ) . Six of the 43 patients who received bevacizumab achieved a partial response ( objective response rate [ ORR ] , 14% ) . Grade 3-4 asthenia , hemorrhage , and aminotransferase elevation occurred in five ( 12% ) , three ( 7% ) , and three ( 7% ) patients , respectively . During treatment , placental growth factor markedly increased , whereas vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A dramatically decreased ( p &lt ; .0001 ) ; soluble VEGF receptor-2 ( p &lt ; .0001 ) and CECs ( p = .03 ) transiently increased on day 3 . High and increased CEC counts at day 15 were associated with the ORR ( p = .04 ) and the 16W-DCR ( p = .02 ) , respectively . Lower interleukin ( IL)-8 levels at baseline ( p = .01 ) and throughout treatment ( p â¤ .04 ) were associated with the 16W-DCR . High baseline IL-8 and IL-6 levels predicted shorter progression-free and overall survival times ( p â¤ .04 ) . CONCLUSION Bevacizumab is active and well tolerated in patients with advanced HCC . The clinical value of CECs , IL-6 , and IL-8 warrants further investigation .	inducing angiogenesis
22766785	The apoptotic effects of interferon lambdas ( IFNÎ»s ) have been described in several types of cancers . However , their effects on human lung cancer cells and the mechanisms are elusive . In addition , the interaction between IFNÎ»s and other interferons remains unclear . The interplay between IFNÎ± and IFNÎ» has been reported . However , although IFNÎ³ is a well-known regulatory interferon , the mechanisms through which it regulates IFNÎ»s in lung cancer cells are unknown . These issues are critical for the application of IFNÎ»s in lung cancer therapy . In this study , we used A549 , a cell line derived from a human lung carcinoma , to characterize the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of IFNÎ»s on lung cancer , and the interplay between IFNÎ³ and IFNÎ» . Because overexpression of full-length ectopic IFNÎ»R1 led to cell death , we generated A549 cells stably expressing a chimeric receptor ( 10R1/Î»R1 ) , which is composed of the extracellular domain of IL-10 receptor ( IL10R1 ) fused in tandem to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the IFNÎ» receptor ( IFNÎ»R1 ) . By comparing with A549 cells stably expressing its cognate vector , we demonstrated that IL-10 stimulation triggered the intracellular IFNÎ» signaling via 10R1/Î»R1 receptor . By using A549 cells expressing 10R1/Î»R1 , we report that the IFNÎ»R1 chain of IFNÎ» receptor possesses an intrinsic ability to trigger apoptosis in human lung cancer cells . Although it did not suppress cell proliferation , IFNÎ» signaling via 10R1/Î»R1 receptor induced cell cycle arrest , externalization of phosphatidylserine , DNA fragmentation , activation of caspase-3 , caspase-8 and caspase-9 . However , the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK did not prevent apoptosis . In addition , the extent of induced apoptosis correlate with the expression levels of the IFNÎ» receptor and the levels of STAT1 activation . Lastly , we demonstrated that IFNÎ³ sensitized A549 cells to IFNÎ»-induced apoptosis , via upregulation of IFNÎ»R1 . These data indicate the potential of IFNÎ» , alone or in combination with IFNÎ³ , in the treatment of human lung carcinoma .	resisting cell death
22768028	Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) is one of the most important mediators of angiogenesis . Single-chain ( sc)-VEGF protein containing an N-terminal Cys-tag has been designed for site-specific modification with a variety of imaging and therapeutic moieties . Site-specific labeling of scVEGF with thiol-reactive prosthetic group , N-[2-(4-(18)F-fluorobenzamido) ethyl ] maleimide ( [ (18)F]FBEM ) for positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging of VEFGR may provide a new tracer which has great potential for clinical translation.Methods : [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF was synthesized by site-specific conjugation of ( 18)F-FBEM to a thiol group in Cys-tag of scVEGF at room temperature . The functional activity after labeling was tested by immunofluorescence staining , cellular uptake and efflux . The tumor targeting and in vivo properties were evaluated by biodistribution and microPET studies in tumor-bearing mice.Results : The radiolabeling yield and specific activity of [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF were 20.6 ï¿½ 15.1% ( based on starting [ (18)F]FBEM , uncorrected , n = 5 ) and 58.8 ï¿½ 12.4 GBq/ï¿½mol , respectively . Noninvasive microPET and direct tissue sampling experiments demonstrated that [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF had VEGFR specific tumor uptake in MDA-MB-435 , U87MG and 4T1 xenograft models . The optimal tumor uptake was achieved at 2 h p.i. , which can be partially , but significantly blocked by co-injection of non-labeled scVEGF protein . Overall , [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF showed VEGFR specific tumor uptake.Conclusion : The scVEGF was site-specifically labeled with ( 18)F via [ (18)F]FBEM prosthetic group and the tracer [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF exhibited high receptor binding affinity and tumor targeting efficacy . Further study of [ (18)F ] FBEM-scVEGF to evaluate angiogenesis in cancer and other disease types is warranted .	inducing angiogenesis
22769410	OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to immunohistochemically evaluate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-1 , MMP- 2 , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase ( TIMP)-1 , TIMP-2 , and podoplanin in oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) . Immunohistochemical staining of podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessel density ( LVD ) was also assessed . STUDY DESIGN Forty cases of OSCC were analyzed by immunohistochemistry . RESULTS MMP-2 , MMP-10 , TIMP-1 , TIMP-2 , and podoplanin were detected in each of the 40 OSCC cases . The expression of MMP-2 was significantly correlated with histologic grade . The expression of podoplanin was positively correlated with gender and negatively correlated with tumor size . A significant positive correlation was also detected between LVD and the presence of lymph node metastases , gender , age , and diameter of the lymph node ( if involved ) , as well as histologic grade . CONCLUSIONS The results are suggestive of important roles that MMP-2 , MMP-10 , TIMP-2 , and podoplanin play in pathologic processes of OSCC , including invasion . Our findings also suggest that LVD may play a role in lymphatic metastasis and tumor progression .	activating invasion and metastasis
22773298	Bone marrow necrosis ( BMN ) is a rare finding in children with malignancy occurring most commonly in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . This article describes the first case of a girl who developed BMN during treatment for Hodgkin's disease . During the second cycle of chemotherapy , she experienced sudden profound bone pain in the lumbosacral region associated with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , fibrin degradation products ( D-Dimer ) , and alkaline phosphatase as well as pancytopenia and leukoerythroblastosis . MRI studies showed multiple confluent areas with low signal intensity and rim contrast enhancement in all vertebral bodies . Bone marrow biopsy revealed focal necrosis within hypocellular bone marrow . The patient responded quickly to symptomatic treatment with analgetics and heparin ; however , elevations of LDH and D-Dimer persisted for 1.5 and 8 months , respectively . Clinicians should be aware of this rare condition to establish the diagnosis and to continue oncologic treatment as early as possible .	resisting cell death
22778940	Background . Over the past ten years oncological outcomes achieved by local excision techniques ( LETs ) as the sole treatment for early stages of rectal cancer ( ESRC ) have been often disappointing . The reasons for these poor results lie mostly in the high risk of the disease's diffusion to local-regional lymph nodes even in ESRC . Aims . This study aims to find the correct indications for LET in ESRC taking into consideration clinical-pathological features of tumours that may reduce the risk of lymph node metastasis to zero . Methods . Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of casistics of ESRC treated with total mesorectal excision with the aim of identifying risk factors for nodal involvement . Results . The risk of lymph node metastasis is higher in G â¥ 2 and T â¥ 2 tumours with lymphatic and/or vascular invasion . Other features which have not yet been sufficiently investigated include female gender , TSM stage &gt;1 , presence of tumour budding and/or perineural invasion . Conclusions . Results comparable to radical surgery can be achieved by LET only in patients with T(1) N(0) G(1) tumours with low-risk histological features , whereas deeper or more aggressive tumours should be addressed by radical surgery ( RS ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
22797777	MicroRNAs ( miRs ) are small non-coding RNAs that recently emerged as potent regulators of gene expression . The members of the miR-17-92 cluster have been shown to control endothelial cell functions and neovascularization ; however , the regulation and function of the cluster in endothelial cell lineage commitment has not been explored . This project aimed to test the role of the miR-17-92 cluster during endothelial differentiation . We demonstrate that miR-17 , miR-18 , miR-19 and miR-20 are increased upon the induction of endothelial cell differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells . In contrast , miR-92a and the primary miR-17-92 transcript were downregulated . The inhibition of each individual miR of the cluster by cholesterol-modified antagomirs did not affect endothelial marker gene expression . Moreover , the combination of all antagomirs had no effect . These findings illustrate that although the miR-17-92 cluster regulates vascular integrity and angiogenesis , none of the members has a significant impact on the endothelial differentiation of pluripotent stem cells .	inducing angiogenesis
22803408	OBJECTIVE To evaluate the Expression and correlation of cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGF ) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma . METHOD In this study , expression levels of COX-2 , VEGF were examined in 58 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 38 patients with inflammation in nasopharyngeal mucosa by immunohistochemistry method . RESULT The expression of COX-2 , VEGF were higher in nasopharyngeal carcinoma than those in nasopharyngeal mucosa ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) , and they had some correlation with the invasion and lymphatic metastasis and with the clinical stage of nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) . The expression of COX-2 was positively correlated with that of VEGF ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION The coexpression of COX-2 and VEGF may play animportant role in the carcinogenesis and development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma , and they may prom ( see text ) lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma .	activating invasion and metastasis;inducing angiogenesis;tumor promoting inflammation;sustaining proliferative signaling
22815822	Tumor cells are surrounded by infiltrating inflammatory cells , such as lymphocytes , neutrophils , macrophages , and mast cells . A body of evidence indicates that mast cells are associated with various types of tumors . Although role of mast cells can be directly related to their granule content , their function in angiogenesis and tumor progression remains obscure . This study aims to understand the role of mast cells in these processes . Tumors were chemically induced in BALB/c mice and tumor progression was divided into Phases I , II and III . Phase I tumors exhibited a large number of mast cells , which increased in phase II and remained unchanged in phase III . The expression of mouse mast cell protease ( mMCP)-4 , mMCP-5 , mMCP-6 , mMCP-7 , and carboxypeptidase A were analyzed at the 3 stages . Our results show that with the exception of mMCP-4 expression of these mast cell chymase ( mMCP-5 ) , tryptases ( mMCP-6 and 7 ) , and carboxypeptidase A ( mMC-CPA ) increased during tumor progression . Chymase and tryptase activity increased at all stages of tumor progression whereas the number of mast cells remained constant from phase II to III . The number of new blood vessels increased significantly in phase I , while in phases II and III an enlargement of existing blood vessels occurred . In vitro , mMCP-6 and 7 are able to induce vessel formation . The present study suggests that mast cells are involved in induction of angiogenesis in the early stages of tumor development and in modulating blood vessel growth in the later stages of tumor progression .	inducing angiogenesis
22821546	Semaphorin 5A , a member of semaphorin family , was originally identified as axonal guidance factor functioning during neuronal development . Previously , we showed that the expression of semaphorin 5A might contribute to the metastasis of gastric cancer . However , its functional roles and mechanism(s) in invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer remain unclear . By using human gastric caner cell lines Parental SGC7901 , SGC7901-siScrambled and SGC7901-siSema 5A , we found that semaphorin 5A significantly promoted the invasive and metastatic abilities of gastric cancer cell in vitro . Semaphorin 5A increased the expression of MMP9 by activating phosphorylated ErK1/2 in gastric cancer cell . Furthermore , MEK inhibitor PD98059 and MMP9 antibody ( Ab ) significantly inhibited in vitro invasive and metastatic abilities induced by semaphorin 5A . Taken together , the present work revealed a novel function of semaphorin 5A that the existence of semaphorin 5A could promote invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by regulating MMP9 expression , at least partially , via the MEK/ERKs signal transduction pathway . Semaphorin 5A and its regulated molecules could be the potential targets for cancer therapy .	activating invasion and metastasis;sustaining proliferative signaling
22825327	Gadd45a , the first well-defined p53 downstream gene , can be induced by multiple DNA-damaging agents , which plays important roles in the control of cell cycle checkpoint , DNA repair process and signaling transduction . Our previous findings suggested that Gadd45a maintains cell-cell adhesion and cell contact inhibition . However , little is known about how Gadd45a participates in the suppression of malignancy in human cancer cells . To examine the functions of Gadd45a in cell invasion and metastasis , we performed the adhesion , wound-healing and transwell assays in Gadd45a ( +/+ ) and Gadd45a ( -/- ) MEF cell lines . We found the adhesion , migration and invasive abilities were much higher in Gadd45a deficient cells . We furthermore applied high-throughput cDNA microarray analysis and bioinformatics analysis to analyze the mechanisms of Gadd45a gene in invasion and metastasis . Compared with the Gadd45a wild type cells , the Gadd45a deficient cells showed a wide range of transcripts alterations . The altered gene pathways were predicted by the MAS software , which indicated focal adhesion,cell communication,ECM-receptor interaction as the three main pathways . Real-time PCR was employed to validate the differentially expressed genes . Interestingly , we figured out that the deregulations of these genes are caused neither by genomic aberrations nor methylation status . These findings provided a novel insight that Gadd45a may involve in tumor progression by regulating related genes expressions .	activating invasion and metastasis
22827697	Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) in cancer cells is considered to be a prerequisite for acquiring invasive/migratory phenotype and subsequent metastasis . This study provides molecular evidence associated with the antimetastatic effect of black tea polyphenol extracts ( BTE ) , which contain polyphenols including gallic acid , gallocatechin , catechin , epigallocatechin-3-gallate , epicatechin-3-gallate , and theaflavin 3,3'-digallate , in an an oral squamous cell culture system by showing a nearly complete inhibition on the invasion ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) of SCC-4 cells via reduced activities of MMP-2 ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) and u-PA ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) . Immunoblot was performed to find that BTE could induce up-regulation of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and inhibit mesenchymal markers such as snail-1 and vimentin . BTE inhibited p-FAK and p-paxillin , indicating the anti-EMT effect of BTE in oral squamous cell carcinoma . BTE was evidenced by its inhibition of the tumor growth of SCC-4 cells via cancer cell xenografted nude mice mode . These results suggested that BTE could reduce invasion by reversing EMT in human oral cancer cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
22829774	The Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres ( ALT ) pathway is a telomerase-independent pathway for telomere maintenance that is active in a significant subset of human cancers and in vitro immortalized cell lines . ALT is thought to involve templated extension of telomeres through homologous recombination , but the genetic or epigenetic changes that unleash ALT are not known . Recently , mutations in the ATRX/DAXX chromatin remodeling complex and histone H3.3 were found to correlate with features of ALT in pancreatic neuroendocrine cancers , pediatric glioblastomas , and other tumors of the central nervous system , suggesting that these mutations might contribute to the activation of the ALT pathway in these cancers . We have taken a comprehensive approach to deciphering ALT by applying genomic , molecular biological , and cell biological approaches to a panel of 22 ALT cell lines , including cell lines derived in vitro . Here we show that loss of ATRX protein and mutations in the ATRX gene are hallmarks of ALT-immortalized cell lines . In addition , ALT is associated with extensive genome rearrangements , marked micronucleation , defects in the G2/M checkpoint , and altered double-strand break ( DSB ) repair . These attributes will facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of ALT positive human cancers .	enabling replicative immortality;genomic instability and mutation;evading growth suppressors
22842620	In a screen for thoracic malignancy-associated markers , thyroid stimulating hormone receptor ( TSHR ) was identified as a candidate as it binds to the previously-characterized lung cancer marker NKX2-1 . We screened for mutations in all coding regions of the TSHR gene in 96 lung adenocarcinoma samples and their matched adjacent normal lung samples . We found one patient with a somatic mutation at codon 458 ( exon 10 ) , which is located at the transmembrane domain where most TSHR mutations have been found in thyroid-related diseases . This patient had lung adenocarcinoma with BAC ( bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ) features in the setting of a prior medical history significant for carotid stenosis and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . In order to characterize the genetic features of TSHR in lung cancer , we checked for TSHR expression and copy number in the 96 lung cancer tissues . TSHR protein expression was generally overexpressed in multiple thoracic malignancies ( adenocarcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma and malignant pleural mesothelioma ) by immunohistochemistry . Our data suggest that aberrant TSHR function may contribute to lung cancer development or a subgroup of lung cancer with specific clinical phenotypes .	genomic instability and mutation
22844446	Proton radiotherapy has gained more favor among oncologists as a treatment option for localized and deep-seated tumors . In addition , protons are a major constituent of the space radiation astronauts receive during space flights . The potential for these exposures to lead to , or enhance cancer risk has not been well studied . Our objective is to study the biological effects of low energy protons on epithelial cells and its propensity to enhance transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGFÎ²1)-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , a process occurring during tumor progression and critical for invasion and metastasis . Non-transformed mink lung epithelial cells ( Mv1Lu ) and hTERT- immortalized human esophageal epithelial cells ( EPC ) were used in this study . EMT was identified by alterations in cell morphology , EMT-related gene expression changes determined using real-time PCR , and EMT changes in specific cellular markers detected by immunostaining and western blotting . Although TGFÎ²1 treatment alone is able to induce EMT in both Mv1Lu and EPC cells , low energy protons ( 5 MeV ) at doses as low as 0.1 Gy can enhance TGFÎ²1 induced EMT . Protons alone can also induce a mild induction of EMT . SD208 , a potent TGFÎ² Receptor 1 ( TGFÎ²R1 ) kinase inhibitor , can efficiently block TGFÎ²1/Smad signaling and attenuate EMT induction . We suggest a model for EMT after proton irradiation in normal and cancerous tissue based on our results that showed that low and high doses of protons can sensitize normal human epithelial cells to mesenchymal transition , more prominently in the presence of TGFÎ²1 , but also in the absence of TGFÎ²1 .	activating invasion and metastasis
22848674	"BACKGROUND Flat adenomas are a subgroup of colorectal adenomas that have been associated with a distinct biology and a more aggressive clinical behavior compared to their polypoid counterparts . In the present study , we aimed to compare the mutation spectrum of 14 cancer genes , between these two phenotypes . METHODS A consecutive series of 106 flat and 93 polypoid adenomas was analyzed retrospectively for frequently occurring mutations in "" hot spot "" regions of KRAS , BRAF , PIK3CA and NRAS , as well as selected mutations in CTNNB1 ( β-catenin ) , EGFR , FBXW7 ( CDC4 ) , PTEN , STK11 , MAP2K4 , SMAD4 , PIK3R1 and PDGFRA using a high-throughput genotyping technique . Additionally , APC was analyzed using direct sequencing . RESULTS APC mutations were more frequent in polypoid adenomas compared to flat adenomas ( 48.5% versus 30.3% , respectively , p = 0.02 ) . Mutations in KRAS , BRAF , NRAS , FBXW7 and CTNNB1 showed similar frequencies in both phenotypes . Between the different subtypes of flat adenomas ( 0-IIa , LST-F and LST-G ) no differences were observed for any of the investigated genes . CONCLUSION The lower APC mutation rate in flat adenomas compared to polypoid adenomas suggests that disruption of the Wnt-pathway may occur via different mechanisms in these two phenotypes . Furthermore , in contrast to previous observations our results in this large well-defined sample set indicate that there is no significant association between the different morphological phenotypes and mutations in key genes of the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway ."	genomic instability and mutation
22848707	BACKGROUND Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) encodes six nuclear transformation-associated proteins that induce extensive changes in cellular gene expression and signaling and induce B-cell transformation . The role of HIF1A in EBV-induced B-cell immortalization has not been previously studied . METHODS AND FINDINGS Using Western blotting and Q-PCR , we found that HIF1A protein is stabilized in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells . Western blotting , GST pulldown assays , and immunoprecipitation showed that EBV-encoded nuclear antigens EBNA-5 and EBNA-3 bind to prolylhydroxylases 1 and 2 , respectively , thus inhibiting HIF1A hydroxylation and degradation . Immunostaining and Q-PCR showed that the stabilized HIF1A translocates to the nucleus , forms a heterodimer with ARNT , and transactivates several genes involved in aerobic glycolysis . Using biochemical assays and Q-PCR , we also found that lymphoblastoid cells produce high levels of lactate , lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate . CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that activation of the aerobic glycolytic pathway , corresponding to the Warburg effect , occurs in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells , in contrast to mitogen-activated B-cells .	cellular energetics
22884369	Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 ( STIP1 ) , a cochaperone that organizes other chaperones , heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) , was recently shown to be secreted by human ovarian cancer cells . In neuronal tissues , binding to prion protein was required for STIP1 to activate the ERK ( extracellular-regulated MAP kinase ) signaling pathways . However , we report that STIP1 binding to a bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor , ALK2 ( activin A receptor , type II-like kinase 2 ) , was necessary and sufficient to stimulate proliferation of ovarian cancer cells . The binding of STIP1 to ALK2 activated the SMAD signaling pathway , leading to transcriptional activation of ID3 ( inhibitor of DNA binding 3 ) , promoting cell proliferation . In conclusion , ovarian-cancer-tissue-secreted STIP1 stimulates cancer cell proliferation by binding to ALK2 and activating the SMAD-ID3 signaling pathways . Although animal studies are needed to confirm these mechanisms in vivo , our results may pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22896630	IFN-Î³ is a master regulator of the immune responses that occur in the transplanted kidney , acting both on the immune system and on the graft itself . The cellular responses to IFN-Î³ are complex , and emerging evidence suggests that IFN-Î³ may regulate autophagic functions . Conversely , autophagy modulates innate and adaptive immune functions in various contexts . In this study , we identify a novel mechanism by which IFN-Î³ activates autophagy in human kidney epithelial cells and provide new insights into how autophagy regulates immune functions in response to IFN-Î³ . Our results indicate that IFN-Î³ promotes tryptophan depletion , activates the eIF2Î± kinase general control nonderepressible-2 ( GCN2 ) , and leads to an increase in the autophagic flux . Further , tryptophan supplementation and RNA interference directed against GCN2 inhibited IFN-Î³-induced autophagy . This process is of functional relevance because autophagy regulates the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors by human kidney epithelial cells in response to IFN-Î³ . These findings assign to IFN-Î³ a novel function in the regulation of autophagy , which , in turn , modulates IFN-Î³-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines .	resisting cell death;tumor promoting inflammation
22901140	Breast cancer metastasis is the most common cause of cancer-related death in women . Thus , seeking targets of breast tumor cells is an attractive goal towards improving clinical treatment . The present study showed that CCL18 from tumor-associated macrophages could promote breast cancer metastasis via PITPNM3 . In addition , we found that pachymic acid ( PA ) could dose-dependently inhibit migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells , with or without rCCL18 stimulation . Furthermore , evidence was obtained that PA could suppress the phosphorylation of PITPNM3 and the combination of CCL18 and PITPNM3 . Therefore , we speculate that PA could inhibit breast cancer metastasis via PITPNM3 .	activating invasion and metastasis
22922989	Androgen receptor ( AR ) signals have been suggested to contribute to bladder tumorigenesis and cancer progression . Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) also leads to stimulation of bladder tumor growth . However , crosstalk between AR and EGFR pathways in bladder cancer remains uncharacterized . We have recently shown that androgens activate the EGFR pathway in bladder cancer cells . The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of EGF on AR activity in bladder cancer . EGF increased AR transcriptional activity by 1.2- , 1.9- and 2.0-fold in UMUC3 , 5637-AR and J82-AR cell lines , respectively , over mock treatment and a specific EGFR inhibitor , PD168393 , antagonized the EGF effect . Combined treatment of EGF and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) further induced AR transactivation while an AR antagonist , hydroxyflutamide ( HF ) , abolished the effect of not only DHT but also EGF . In growth assays , EGF alone/DHT alone/EGF+DHT increased cell numbers by 16/12/19% , 6/14/18% and 30/12/38% in UMUC3-control-shRNA , 5637-AR and J82-AR , respectively , whereas the effects of EGF were marginal or less significant in UMUC3-AR-shRNA ( 8% ) or AR-negative 5637-V ( &lt;1% ) and J82-V ( 17% ) cells . HF treatment at least partially counteracted the EGF effect on the growth of AR-positive cells . Western blotting demonstrated that EGF , especially in the presence of DHT , upregulated the expression of the p160 coactivator TIF2 and HF again blocked this stimulation . Co-immunoprecipitation revealed the association between AR and estrogen receptor ( ER)-Î² or Src in UMUC3 cells and stronger associations with EGF treatment , implying the involvement of the AR/ER/Src complex in EGF-increased AR transactivation and cell growth . Current results , thus , suggest that EGF promotes bladder cancer cell proliferation via modulation of AR signals . Taken together with our previous findings , crosstalk between EGFR and AR pathways can play an important role in the progression of bladder cancer .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22928441	Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 ( MEN2 ) is an autosomal , dominantly inherited disease characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma , pheochromocytoma , and primary hyperparathyroidism and is divided into types 2A and 2B . Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma ( FMTC ) is characterized by the presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma alone in family members and is considered to be one of the subtypes of MEN2 . Clinical and genetic data on 505 Japanese patients from 275 MEN2 or FMTC families registered at 54 medical institutions were collected by the MEN Consortium of Japan . The diagnosis was MEN2A in 343 ( 67.9% ) patients , MEN2B in 29 ( 5.7% ) , FMTC in 103 ( 20.4% ) , and unclassified in 30 ( 5.9% ) . Medullary thyroid carcinoma was found in 91.2% of patients ( 437/479 ) , pheochromocytoma in 45.6% ( 212/465 ) , and primary hyperparathyroidism in 8.1% ( 37/457 ) . RET genetic testing was performed in 410 patients , and the germline RET mutation was found in 98.8% ( 397/402 ) .	genomic instability and mutation
22944376	Background/Aims : Cimetidine has been shown to play an important role in the treatment of cancer and the regulation of the immune system . Therefore , we aimed to observe the effects of cimetidine on the systematic immune response in the perioperative period . Methodology : Sixty patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled from Jan 2005 to Dec 2005 from Taizhou Hospital . The patients were administrated with cimetidine ( 0.8gï¿½d-1 or 1.2gï¿½d-1 ) or saline from the day of admission to the 10th POD . Venous blood sample was collected and the T- , B- and NK-lymphocyte subsets were determined by flow cytometry . The specimens were subjected to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) response examination . Results : The levels of CD3 and CD4 T-lymphocytes were increased significantly in both low and high dose cimetidine groups 10 days after operation . The number of CD19 B cells was also elevated by cimetidine . However , no significant changes were observed in the CD8 , CD4/CD8 value . TIL responses in the cimetidine groups were also enhanced significantly . Conclusions : Cimetidine can alleviate systematic immunosuppression and improve the local immune function of the colorectal cancer patients in the perioperative period .	avoiding immune destruction
22952903	Activating K-RAS mutations occur at a frequency of 90% in pancreatic cancer , and to date no therapies exist targeting this oncogene . K-RAS signals via downstream effector pathways such as the MAPK and the PI3K signaling pathways , and much effort has been focused on developing drugs targeting components of these pathways . To better understand the requirements for K-RAS and its downstream signaling pathways MAPK and PI3K in pancreatic tumor maintenance , we established an inducible K-RAS knock down system that allowed us to ablate K-RAS in established tumors . Knock down of K-RAS resulted in impaired tumor growth in all pancreatic xenograft models tested , demonstrating that K-RAS expression is indeed required for tumor maintenance of K-RAS mutant pancreatic tumors . We further examined signaling downstream of K-RAS , and detected a robust reduction of pERK levels upon K-RAS knock down . In contrast , no effect on pAKT levels could be observed due to almost undetectable basal expression levels . To investigate the requirement of the MAPK and the PI3K pathways on tumor maintenance , three selected pancreatic xenograft models were tested for their response to MEK or PI3K inhibition . Tumors of all three models regressed upon MEK inhibition , but showed less pronounced response to PI3K inhibition . The effect of MEK inhibition on pancreatic xenografts could be enhanced further by combined application of a PI3K inhibitor . These data provide further rationale for testing combinations of MEK and PI3K inhibitors in clinical trials comprising a patient population with pancreatic cancer harboring mutations in K-RAS .	genomic instability and mutation
22963683	BACKGROUND Î-Ionizing radiation ( IR ) therapy is one of major therapeutic tools in cancer treatment . Nevertheless , Î³-IR therapy failed due to occurrence of metastasis , which constitutes a significant obstacle in cancer treatment . The main aim of this investigation was to construct animal model which present metastasis during radiotherapy in a mouse system in vivo and establishes the molecular mechanisms involved . MATERIALS AND METHODS The C6L transfectant cell line expressing firefly luciferase ( fLuc ) was treated with Î³-IR , followed by immunoblotting , zymography and invasion assay in vitro . We additionally employed the C6L transfectant cell line to construct xenografts in nude mice , which were irradiated with Î³-IR . Irradiated xenograft-containing mice were analyzed via survival curves , measurement of tumor size , and bioluminescence imaging in vivo and ex vivo . Metastatic lesions in organs of mice were further assessed using RT-PCR , H &amp ; E staining and immunohistochemistry . RESULTS Î³-IR treatment of C6L cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and increased cell invasion . In irradiated xenograft-containing mice , tumor sizes were decreased dramatically and survival rates extended . Almost all non-irradiated xenograft-containing control mice had died within 4 weeks . However , we also observed luminescence signals in about 22.5% of Î³-IR-treated mice . Intestines or lungs of mice displaying luminescence signals contained several lesions , which expressed the fLuc gene and presented histological features of cancer tissues as well as expression of EMT markers . CONCLUSIONS These findings collectively indicate that occurrences of metastases during Î³-IR treatment accompanied induction of EMT markers , including increased MMP activity . Establishment of a murine metastasis model during Î³-IR treatment should aid in drug development against cancer metastasis and increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the metastatic process .	activating invasion and metastasis
22969901	RASSF2 has recently been identified as a potential tumor suppressor that serves as a Ras effector in various types of human cancers . However , there have been few reports detailing this in gastric cancer . Samples of gastric adenocarcinoma from 276 Chinese patients with follow-up were analyzed for RASSF2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry . RASSF2 was expressed in up to 31.2% ( 86/276 ) of this group of gastric carcinoma . The expression of RASSF2 was significantly lower in carcinomas than in normal mucosas ( P&lt;0.05 ) . RASSF2 corresponded positively with patient age , histological differentiation , depth of tumor invasion , regional lymph node and distant metastasis , and TNM stage ( all P&lt;0.05 ) . Further multivariate analysis revealed that patient gender , depth of tumor invasion , distant metastasis , TNM stage and the expression of RASSF2 were independent prognostic factors for patients with gastric cancer . The Kaplan-Meier plot showed that the overall mean survival time of the patients with RASSF2-negative expression was shorter than that of patients with positive expression ( Ï(2)=156.874 , P&lt;0.0001 ) . Moreover , RASSF2-negative expression had a much more significant effect on the survival of those patients with early stage tumors ( Ï(2)=127.167 , P&lt;0.0001 ) , highlighted by a &gt;50.9% reduction in 3-year survival compared to that of patients with RASSF2-positive expression . In late stages , the difference was also significant ( Ï(2)=6.246 , P=0.019 ) , with a 35.5% reduction in 3-year survival . It is suggested that RASSF2 plays an important role in the evolution of gastric adenocarcinoma and should be considered as a potential marker for its prognosis .	activating invasion and metastasis
22999863	Macrophages are the prominent components of solid tumors and have complex dual functions in their interaction with cancer cells . Strong evidence suggests that TAM is a part of inflammatory circuits that promote tumor progression . B7-homologue 3 ( B7-H3 ) , a recently identified homologue of B7.1/2 ( CD80/86 ) , has been described to exert co-stimulatory and immune regulatory functions . Here , we showed that a fraction of macrophages in tumor stroma expressed surface B7-H3 molecule . Normal macrophages , which did not express B7-H3 , would be induced expressing B7-H3 molecule when culturing with tumor cell . Although a lung cancer cell line constitutively expressed B7-H3 mRNA and protein in plasma , primary tumor cell isolated from the transplanted lung carcinoma model expressed B7-H3 on the surface . Interestingly , in transplanted lung carcinoma model , the expression of membrane-bound B7-H3 in tumor cells was increased as prolonging of tumor transformation . In support , IL-10 released from TAM could stimulate cancer cell expression of membrane bound B7-H3 . Furthermore , Lung cancer and TAM-related B7-H3 was identified as a strong inhibitor of T-cell effect and influenced the outcome of T cell immune response . In conclusion , TAM-tumor cell interaction-induced membrane-bound B7-H3 represents a novel immune escape mechanism which links the pro-inflammatory response to immune tolerance in the tumor milieu .	avoiding immune destruction
23011762	OBJECTIVES Human neutrophil proteins-1 , -2 , and -3 ( HNPs -1 , -2 , and -3 ) are expressed in several tumor types . However , the role of HNPs 1-3 in human bladder cancer has not yet been determined . We investigated the association between the plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 and clinicopathological parameters in bladder cancer patients . DESIGN AND METHODS The plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 were measured in 60 patients with bladder cancer and in 58 healthy controls . The plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 were determined by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Plasma samples were obtained before surgery . Plasma samples were permitted to clot and were then stored at -80 ï¿½C until use . RESULTS The levels of the HNPs increased from grade 1 to 4 tumors and this difference was statistically significant ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) . Additionally , plasma HNP levels were significantly higher in patients with metastatic bladder cancer and in patients with lymphovascular involvement , metastasis of the lymph nodes , and increased tumor burden ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS The preoperative plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 paralleled the progression and pathological stages of the malignancies . This study suggests that HNPs 1-3 promote tumor invasion and are potential indicators of disease progression in patients with bladder cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis
23023137	Formononetin is a novel herbal isoflavonoid isolated from Astragalus membranaceus , a medicinal plant that possesses antitumorigenic properties . Our previous findings demonstrated that formononetin initiates growth-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic activities in human colon cancer cells . In the present study , we aimed to further examine the potential of formononetin in controlling angiogenesis and tumor cell invasiveness in human colon cancer cells and tumor xenografts . The results showed that formononetin downregulated the expression of the key pro-angiogenic factors , including vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and matrix metalloproteinases . We also discovered that the invasiveness of metastatic colon cancer cells was alleviated following drug treatment . The potential anti-angiogenic effect of formononetin was examined in nude mouse xenografts . The tumor size and the number of proliferating cells were reduced in the tumor tissues obtained from the formononetin-treated group . The serum VEGF level was also reduced in the drug-treated animals when compared to the controls . These findings suggest that formononetin inhibits angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion , and thus support its use in the treatment of advanced and metastatic colon cancers .	inducing angiogenesis;activating invasion and metastasis
23024612	BACKGROUND Angiogenic factors following oncological surgery is important in tumor recurrence . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , angiopoietin 1 ( Ang-1 ) , Ang-2 , soluble VEGF-receptor 1 ( sVEGFR1 ) and sVEGFR2 may influence angiogenesis . This prospective study examined the influence of open and video-assisted thoracic surgery ( VATS ) lung resections for early stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) on postoperative circulating angiogenic factors . METHODS Forty-three consecutive patients underwent major lung resection through either VATS ( n = 23 ) or Open thoracotomy ( n = 20 ) over an 8-month period . Blood samples were collected preoperatively and postoperatively on days ( POD ) 1 and 3 for enzyme linked immunosorbent assay determination of angiogenic factors . RESULTS Patient demographics were comparable . For all patients undergoing major lung resection , postoperative Ang-1 and sVEGFR2 levels were significantly decreased , while Ang-2 and sVEGFR1 levels markedly increased . No significant peri-operative changes in VEGF levels were observed . Compared with open group , VATS had significantly lower plasma levels of VEGF ( VATS 170 Â± 93 pg/mL ; Open 486 Â± 641 pg/mL ; P = 0.04 ) and Ang-2 ( VATS 2484 Â± 1119 pg/mL ; Open 3379 Â± 1287 pg/mL ; P = 0.026 ) on POD3 . CONCLUSIONS Major lung resection for early stage NSCLC leads to a pro-angiogenic status , with increased Ang-2 and decreased Ang-1 productions . VATS is associated with an attenuated angiogenic response with lower circulating VEGF and Ang-2 levels compared with open . Such differences in angiogenic factors may be important in lung cancer biology and recurrence following surgery .	inducing angiogenesis
23026134	Human breast tumors are infiltrated by memory CD4(+) T cells along with increased numbers of regulatory T cells ( Treg ) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC ) that facilitate immune escape and correlate with poor prognosis . Here , we report that inducible costimulatory molecule ( ICOS ) , a T cell costimulatory molecule of the CTLA4/PD1/CD28 family , is expressed mostly by tumor-associated Treg in primary breast tumors . A large proportion of these ICOS(+) Treg were Ki67(+) and this evident proliferative expansion was found to rely on interactions with tumor-associated pDC . Indeed , tumor-associated Treg highly expanded in presence of pDC but failed to proliferate under CD3/CD28 signal . In vitro experiments revealed that the addition of a neutralizing anti-ICOS antibody blocked pDC-induced Treg expansion and interleukin-10 secretion by memory CD4(+) T cells , establishing a pivotal role for ICOS in this process . Supporting these findings , the presence of ICOS(+) cells in clinical specimens of breast cancer correlated with a poor prognosis . Together , our results highlight an important relationship between Treg and pDC in breast tumors , and show that ICOS/ICOS-L interaction is a central event in immunosuppression of tumor-associated memory CD4(+) T cells . These findings strongly rationalize antibody-mediated ICOS blockade as a powerful clinical strategy to correct immune escape and promote therapeutic responses in breast cancer .

23033490	In patients with advanced bladder cancer , glucocorticoids are frequently given to reduce acute toxicity , particularly hyperemesis , during chemotherapy , as well as to improve cachectic conditions . However , it remains unclear whether glucocorticoids directly affect the development and progression of bladder cancer through the glucocorticoid receptor pathway . Glucocorticoid receptor expression was first investigated in human bladder cancer lines and tissue microarrays . Then , the effects of dexamethasone on glucocorticoid receptor transcription , cell proliferation , apoptosis/cell cycle , and invasion were examined in bladder cancer lines . Finally , mouse xenograft models for bladder cancer were used to assess the efficacy of dexamethasone on tumor progression . All the cell lines and tissues examined were found to express glucocorticoid receptor . Dexamethasone increased glucocorticoid receptor-mediated reporter activity and cell proliferation , and inhibited apoptosis in the presence or absence of cisplatin . In contrast , dexamethasone suppressed cell invasion , the expression of its related genes [ MMP-2/MMP-9 , interleukin ( IL)-6 , VEGF ] , and the activity of MMP-2/MMP-9 , and also induced mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition . In addition , dexamethasone increased IÎºBÎ± protein levels and cytosolic accumulation of NF-ÎºB . In xenograft-bearing mice , dexamethasone slightly augmented the growth of the inoculated tumors but completely prevented the development of bloody ascites , suggestive of peritoneal dissemination of tumor cells , and actual metastasis . In all these assays , dexamethasone effects were abolished by a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist or glucocorticoid receptor knockdown via RNA interference . Thus , glucocorticoid receptor activation resulted in promotion of cell proliferation via inhibiting apoptosis yet repression of cell invasion and metastasis . These results may provide a basis of developing improved chemotherapy regimens , including or excluding glucocorticoid receptor agonists/antagonists , for urothelial carcinoma .	resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling;activating invasion and metastasis
23038007	The goal of the present study was to examine hepatic differential gene expression patterns in Fisher-344 rats in response to dietary 2-aminoanthracene ( 2AA ) ingestion for 14 and 28 days . Twenty four post-weaning 3-4 week old F-344 male rats were exposed to 0 mgkg(-1)-diet ( control ) , 50 mgkg(-1)-diet ( low dose ) , 75 mgkg(-1)-diet ( medium dose ) and 100 mgkg(-1)-diet ( high dose ) 2AA for 14 and 28 days . This was followed by analysis of the liver for global gene expression changes . In both time points , the numbers of genes affected seem to correlate with the dose of 2AA . Sixteen mRNAs were differentially expressed in all treatment groups for the short-term exposure group . Similarly , 51 genes were commonly expressed in all 28-day exposure group . Almost all the genes seem to have higher expression relative to the controls . In contrast , cytochrome P450 family 4 , subfamily a , polypeptide 8 ( Cyp4a8 ) , and monocyte to macrophage differentiation-associated ( Mmd2 ) were down-regulated relative to controls . Differentially expressed mRNAs were further analyzed for associations via DAVID . GO categories show the effect of 2AA to be linked with genes responsible for carbohydrate utilization and transport , lipid metabolic processes , stress responses such as inflammation and apoptosis processes , immune system response , DNA damage response , cancer processes and circadian rhythm . The data from the current study identified altered hepatic gene expression profiles that may be associated with carcinoma , autoimmune response , and/or type 2 diabetes . Possible biomarkers due to 2AA toxicity in the liver for future study include Abcb1a , Nhej1 , Adam8 , Cdkn1a , Mgmt , and Nrcam .	genomic instability and mutation;resisting cell death;tumor promoting inflammation
23055798	"Certain mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population . Several factors contribute to this increased frequency , including consanguineous marriages and an event known as a "" bottleneck "" , which occurred in the past and caused a drastic reduction in the genetic variability of this population . Several studies were performed over the years in an attempt to elucidate the role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in susceptibility to breast cancer . The aim of this study was to estimate the carrier frequency of certain common mutations in the BRCA1 ( 185delAG and 5382insC ) and BRCA2 ( 6174delT ) genes in an Ashkenazi Jewish population from Porto Alegre , Brazil . Molecular analyses were done by PCR followed by RFLP ( ACRS ) . The carrier frequencies for BRCA1 185delAG and 5382insC were 0.78 and 0 respectively , and 0.4 for the BRCA2 6174deT mutation . These findings are similar to those of some prior studies but differ from others , possibly due to excluding individuals with a personal or family history of cancer . Our sample was drawn from the community group and included individuals with or without a family or personal history of cancer . Furthermore , increased dispersion among Ashkenazi subpopulations may be the result of strong genetic drift and/or admixture . It is therefore necessary to consider the effects of local admixture on the mismatch distributions of various Jewish populations ."	genomic instability and mutation
23056314	Vasohibin-1 ( VASH1 ) is isolated as an endothelial cell ( EC)-produced angiogenesis inhibitor . We questioned whether VASH1 plays any role besides angiogenesis inhibition , knocked-down or overexpressed VASH1 in ECs , and examined the changes of EC property . Knock-down of VASH1 induced premature senescence of ECs , and those ECs were easily killed by cellular stresses . In contrast , overexpression of VASH1 made ECs resistant to premature senescence and cell death caused by cellular stresses . The synthesis of VASH1 was regulated by HuR-mediated post-transcriptional regulation . We sought to define the underlying mechanism . VASH1 increased the expression of ( superoxide dismutase 2 ) SOD2 , an enzyme known to quench reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Simultaneously , VASH1 augmented the synthesis of sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1 ) , an anti-aging protein , which improved stress tolerance . Paraquat generates ROS and causes organ damage when administered in vivo . More VASH1 ( +/- ) mice died due to acute lung injury caused by paraquat . Intratracheal administration of an adenovirus vector encoding human VASH1 augmented SOD2 and SIRT1 expression in the lungs and prevented acute lung injury caused by paraquat . Thus , VASH1 is a critical factor that improves the stress tolerance of ECs via the induction of SOD2 and SIRT1 .	tumor promoting inflammation
23069871	There is a complex interplay between the immune system and a developing tumor that is manifest in the way that the balance of Tcell subsets in the local tumor environment reflects clinical outcome . Tumor infiltration by CD8(+) Tcells and regulatory Tcells ( Treg ) is associated with improved and reduced survival , respectively , in many cancer types . However , little is known of the prognostic value of immunological parameters measured in peripheral blood . In this study , peripheral CD8(+) T cells and Treg from 43 patients with malignant mesothelioma or advanced non-small-cell lung cancer scheduled to commence palliative chemotherapy were assessed by flow cytometry and evaluated for association with patient survival . Patients had a higher proportion of peripheral Treg , proliferating CD8(+) Tcells and CD8(+) Tcells with an activated effector phenotype compared with age-matched healthy controls . Higher proportions of Treg and proliferating CD8(+) Tcells were both associated with poor survival in univariate analyses ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 3.81 , 95% CI 1.69-8.57 ; p&lt;0.01 and HR 2.86 , 95% CI 1.26-6.50 ; p&lt;0.05 , respectively ) . CD8(+) Tcell proliferation was independently predictive of reduced survival in multivariate analysis ( HR 2.58 , 95% CI 1.01-6.61 ; p&lt;0.05 ) . These findings suggest that peripheral CD8(+) T cell proliferation can be a useful prognostic marker in patients with thoracic malignancies planned for palliative chemotherapy .	avoiding immune destruction
23081697	Liver metastasis from colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality . Myeloid cells play pivotal roles in the metastatic process , but their prometastatic functions in liver metastasis remain incompletely understood . To investigate their role , we simulated liver metastasis in C57BL/6 mice through intrasplenic inoculation of MC38 colon carcinoma cells . Among the heterogeneous myeloid infiltrate , we identified a distinct population of CD11b/Gr1(mid) cells different from other myeloid populations previously associated with liver metastasis . These cells increased in number dramatically during establishment of liver metastases and were recruited from bone marrow by tumor-derived CCL2 . Liver metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma cells followed this pattern but this mechanism is not universal as liver colonization by B16F1 melanoma cells did not recruit similar subsets . Inhibition of CCL2 signaling and absence of its cognate receptor CCR2 reduced CD11b/Gr1(mid) recruitment and decreased tumor burden . Depletion of the CD11b/Gr1(mid) subset in a transgenic CD11b-diphtheria toxin receptor mouse model markedly reduced tumor cell proliferation . There was no evidence for involvement of an adaptive immune response in the prometastatic effects of CD11b/Gr1(mid) cells . Additionally , an analogous myeloid subset was found in liver metastases of some colorectal cancer patients . Conclusion : Collectively , our findings highlight the importance of myeloid cells-in this case a selective CD11b/Gr1(mid) subset-in sustaining development of colorectal cancer liver metastasis and identify a potential target for antimetastatic therapy .

23092936	BACKGROUND Acrylamide is a common dietary exposure that crosses the human placenta . It is classified as a probable human carcinogen , and developmental toxicity has been observed in rodents . OBJECTIVES We examined the associations between prenatal exposure to acrylamide and birth outcomes in a prospective European mother-child study . METHODS Hemoglobin ( Hb ) adducts of acrylamide and its metabolite glycidamide were measured in cord blood ( reflecting cumulated exposure in the last months of pregnancy ) from 1,101 singleton pregnant women recruited in Denmark , England , Greece , Norway , and Spain during 2006-2010 . Maternal diet was estimated through food-frequency questionnaires . RESULTS Both acrylamide and glycidamide Hb adducts were associated with a statistically significant reduction in birth weight and head circumference . The estimated difference in birth weight for infants in the highest versus lowest quartile of acrylamide Hb adduct levels after adjusting for gestational age and country was -132 g ( 95% CI : -207 , -56 ) ; the corresponding difference for head circumference was -0.33 cm ( 95% CI : -0.61 , -0.06 ) . Findings were similar in infants of nonsmokers , were consistent across countries , and remained after adjustment for factors associated with reduced birth weight . Maternal consumption of foods rich in acrylamide , such as fried potatoes , was associated with cord blood acrylamide adduct levels and with reduced birth weight . CONCLUSIONS Dietary exposure to acrylamide was associated with reduced birth weight and head circumference . Consumption of specific foods during pregnancy was associated with higher acrylamide exposure in utero . If confirmed , these findings suggest that dietary intake of acrylamide should be reduced among pregnant women .	genomic instability and mutation
23093405	In cancer , glucose uptake and glycolysis are increased regardless of the oxygen concentration in the cell , a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect . Several ( but not all ) glycolytic enzymes have been investigated as potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment using RNAi . Here , four previously untargeted glycolytic enzymes , aldolase A , glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , triose phosphate isomerase , and enolase 1 , are targeted using RNAi in Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells . Of these enzymes , knockdown of aldolase causes the greatest effect , inhibiting cell proliferation by 90% . This defect is rescued by expression of exogenous aldolase . However , aldolase knockdown does not affect glycolytic flux or intracellular ATP concentration , indicating a non-metabolic cause for the cell proliferation defect . Furthermore , this defect could be rescued with an enzymatically dead aldolase variant that retains the known F-actin binding ability of aldolase . One possible model for how aldolase knockdown may inhibit transformed cell proliferation is through its disruption of actin-cytoskeleton dynamics in cell division . Consistent with this hypothesis , aldolase knockdown cells show increased multinucleation . These results are compared with other studies targeting glycolytic enzymes with RNAi in the context of cancer cell proliferation and suggest that aldolase may be a useful target in the treatment of cancer .	cellular energetics
23094058	Angiogenesis is a crucial step in the growth and metastasis of cancers , since it enables the growing tumor to receive oxygen and nutrients . Cancer prevention using natural products has become an integral part of cancer control . We studied the antiangiogenic activity of quercetin using ex vivo , in vivo and in vitro models . Rat aortic ring assay showed that quercetin at non-toxic concentrations significantly inhibited microvessel sprouting and exhibited a significant inhibition in the proliferation , migration , invasion and tube formation of endothelial cells , which are key events in the process of angiogenesis . Most importantly , quercetin treatment inhibited ex vivo angiogenesis as revealed by chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane assay ( CAM ) and matrigel plug assay . Western blot analysis showed that quercetin suppressed VEGF induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 and their downstream protein kinases AKT , mTOR , and ribosomal protein S6 kinase in HUVECs . Quercetin ( 20 mg/kg/d ) significantly reduced the volume and the weight of solid tumors in prostate xenograft mouse model , indicating that quercetin inhibited tumorigenesis by targeting angiogenesis . Furthermore , quercetin reduced the cell viability and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells , which were correlated with the downregulation of AKT , mTOR and P70S6K expressions . Collectively the findings in the present study suggest that quercetin inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis by targeting VEGF-R2 regulated AKT/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway , and could be used as a potential drug candidate for cancer therapy .	activating invasion and metastasis;inducing angiogenesis;sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death
23115482	INTRODUCTION Characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of colonic adenomas , classic familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is one of the most common hereditary syndromes associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer . Several studies have attempted to correlate specific APC mutations with clinical phenotype.6 However , there is considerable variability in the expression of specific phenotypes within families and among individuals with identical mutations.7 CASE PRESENTATION A 30 year-old Hispanic female presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of persistent , worsening , left lower quadrant abdominal pain . She had no family history of malignancy . Sigmoidoscopy revealed innumerable polyps in the rectum and sigmoid colon and a large mass in the sigmoid colon . Biopsy of the mass revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading the subserosa . Endoscopy revealed innumerable polyps . Genetic testing of the patient via southern blot revealed a germline APC mutation 3927del5 , resulting in a premature truncation of the APC protein at amino acid position 1312 . CONCLUSION Genetic information has only recently started being incorporated into clinical care . More research and randomized clinical trials need to be conducted to definitively characterize random mutations . Once these mutations are further understood , FAP patients may be able to be risk stratified and this may ultimately improve the screening , diagnosis , and treatment of this rare condition .	genomic instability and mutation
23121427	The most potent tumorigen identified among the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) is the nonplanar fjord region dibenzo[a,l]pyrene ( DB[a,l]P ) . It is metabolically activated in vivo through the widely studied diol epoxide ( DE ) pathway to form covalent adducts with DNA bases , predominantly guanine and adenine . The ( +)-11S,12R,13R,14S DE enantiomer forms adducts via its C14 position with the exocyclic amino group of guanine . Here , we present the first nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of a DB[a,l]P-derived adduct , the 14R-(+)-trans-anti-DB[a,l]P-N(2)-dG ( DB[a,l]P-dG ) lesion in double-stranded DNA . In contrast to the stereochemically identical benzo[a]pyrene-derived N(2)-dG adduct ( B[a]P-dG ) in which the B[a]P rings reside in the B-DNA minor groove on the 3'-side of the modifed deoxyguanosine , in the DB[a,l]P-derived adduct the DB[a,l]P rings intercalate into the duplex on the 3'-side of the modified base from the sterically crowded minor groove . Watson-Crick base pairing of the modified guanine with the partner cytosine is broken , but these bases retain some stacking with the bulky DB[a,l]P ring system . This new theme in PAH DE-DNA adduct conformation differs from ( 1 ) the classical intercalation motif in which Watson-Crick base pairing is intact at the lesion site and ( 2 ) the base-displaced intercalation motif in which the damaged base and its partner are extruded from the helix . The structural considerations that lead to the intercalated conformation of the DB[a,l]P-dG lesion in contrast to the minor groove alignment of the B[a]P-dG adduct , and the implications of the DB[a,l]P-dG conformational motif for the recognition of such DNA lesions by the human nucleotide excision repair apparatus , are discussed .	genomic instability and mutation
23123725	Angiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel formation from pre-existing ones . Angiogenic factors contribute to neovascularization that takes place in angiogenesis-dependent diseases , including cancer . Inhibiting the activity of the angiogenic factors to block the angiogenesis pathways is the current strategy of cancer therapy . Basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) is regarded as one of the most important angiogenic factors . Herein , we selected polyoxometalates ( POMs ) with different structures to study the interactions between bFGF and POMs . The results show that POMs could bind to the protein with high affinity , causing detectable changes in conformation and biophysical properties of protein . In addition , POMs could effectively inhibit the cell proliferation induced by bFGF . Significantly , we found that the structure , size and composition of POMs play a key role in the interactions between bFGF and POMs . This study will be meaningful for future screening and design of polyoxometalate-based anticancer drugs .	inducing angiogenesis
23124652	Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide ; however , the prognosis of HCC patients remains poor . This poor prognosis is mainly attributed to the high rate of intrahepatic and distant metastasis . HCC often occurs in a hypoxic environment and hypoxia can activate metastatic programs , ultimately leading to tumor recurrence or metastasis . Thus , the discovery and subsequent development of novel agents to block HCC invasion and migration are the primary objectives of hepatic cancer research . The Notch1 signaling pathway might be involved in hypoxia-induced carcinoma metastasis . However , the mechanisms by which Notch1 mediates cell metastasis , particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma , are not yet entirely clear . The results of the present study show that hypoxia increases the invasion and migration capacities of different HCC cells . Activation of the Notch1 signaling pathway contributes to hypoxia-induced invasion and migration in HCC cells . The activated Notch1 signaling pathway can regulate Snail/E-cadherin through cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) under hypoxic conditions . The above results suggest that the Notch1/COX-2/Snail/E-cadherin pathway is possibly associated with hypoxia-induced invasion and migration in HCC cells . Thus , targeting Notch1 may be useful for devising novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for HCC .	activating invasion and metastasis
23127529	BACKGROUND/AIMS Analysis of cystic fluid may be useful in distinguishing between benign and malignant cysts which has significant impact on their management . The aim of our study was to assess the diagnostic utility of carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) and K-ras gene mutation in pancreatic cysts fluid . METHODS The study included 56 patients with pancreatic cystic fluid collected for analysis . The cysts were classified as benign ( simple cysts , pseudocysts , serous cystadenoma ) - 39 patients or premalignant/malignant ( mucinous cystadenoma , IPMN , cystadenocarcinoma ) - 17 patients . The patients history , CEA fluid concentrations and presence of K-ras mutation were analyzed . RESULTS CEA were higher in patients with malignant cysts ( mean levels 238±12.5ng/ml ; range 32.8-4985ng/ml ) compared to benign lesions ( mean levels 34.5±3.7ng/ml ; range 3.9-693ng/ml ; p&lt;0.001 ) . K-ras mutation correctly classified 11 of 17 patients with premalignant/malignant lesions . It was also detected in 1 patient with final diagnosis of benign cyst ( the sensitivity 64.7% and the specificity 97.4% ; p&lt;0.01 ) . If CEA and molecular analysis were combined in that cysts with either CEA level&gt;45ng/ml or presence of K-ras mutation , than 16 of 17 premalignant/malignant cysts were correctly identified ( 94.1% ) . CONCLUSION Molecular analysis of pancreatic cyst fluid adds diagnostic value to the preoperative diagnosis and should be considered when cyst cytologic examination is negative for malignancy .	genomic instability and mutation
23137061	Inorganic arsenic in the drinking water is a multisite human carcinogen that potentially targets the kidney . Recent evidence also indicates that developmental arsenic exposure impacts renal carcinogenesis in humans and mice . Emerging theory indicates that cancer may be a disease of stem cells ( SCs ) and that there are abundant active SCs during early life . Therefore , we hypothesized that inorganic arsenic targets SCs , or partially differentiated progenitor cells ( PCs ) , for oncogenic transformation . Thus , a rat kidney SC/PC cell line , RIMM-18 , was chronically exposed to low-level arsenite ( 500 nM ) for up to 28 weeks . Multiple markers of acquired cancer phenotype were assessed biweekly during arsenic exposure , including secreted matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity , proliferation rate , colony formation in soft agar , and cellular invasiveness . Arsenic exposure by 10 weeks and after also induced marked and sustained increases in colony formation , indicative of the loss of contact inhibition , and increased invasiveness , both cancer cell characteristics . Compared to the passage-matched control , chronic arsenic exposure caused exposure-duration dependent increases in secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity , Cox-2 expression , and more rapid proliferation ( all &gt;2-fold ) , characteristics typical of cancer cells . Dysregulation of SC maintenance genes and signaling pathways are common during oncogenesis . During arsenite exposure , expression of several genes associated with normal kidney development and SC regulation and differentiation ( i.e. , Wt-1 , Wnt-4 , Bmp-7 , etc. ) were aberrantly altered . Arsenic-exposed renal SCs produced more nonadherent spheroid bodies that grew much more aggressively in Matrigel , typical of cancer SCs ( CSCs ) . The transformed cells also showed gene overexpression typical of renal SCs/CSCs ( CD24 , Osr1 , Ncam ) and arsenic adaptation such as overexpression of Mt-1 , Mt2 , Sod-1 , and Abcc2 . These data suggest that inorganic arsenic induced an acquired cancer phenotype in vitro in these rat kidney SCs potentially forming CSCs and , consistent with data in vivo , indicate that these multipotent SCs may be targets of arsenic during renal carcinogenesis .	activating invasion and metastasis;evading growth suppressors;sustaining proliferative signaling;tumor promoting inflammation
23140147	OBJECT A considerable body of evidence indicates that inflammation and angiogenesis play a significant role in the development and progression of chronic subdural hematoma ( CSDH ) . While various experimental and clinical studies have implicated placental growth factor ( PlGF ) in the processes that underpin pathological angiogenesis , no study has thus far investigated its expression in CSDH . The actions of PlGF and its related proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) are antagonized by a high-affinity soluble receptor , namely soluble VEGF receptor-1 ( sVEGFR-1 ) , and thus the ratio between sVEGFR-1 and angiogenic factors provides an index of angiogenic capacity . METHODS In the present study , using an automated electrochemiluminescence assay , levels of PlGF and sVEGFR-1 were quantified in serum and hematoma fluid obtained in 16 patients with CSDH . RESULTS Levels of PlGF and sVEGFR-1 were significantly higher in hematoma fluid than in serum ( p &lt ; 0.0001 ) . In serum , levels of sVEGFR-1 were higher than those of PlGF ( p &lt ; 0.0001 ) , whereas in hematoma fluid this difference was not apparent . Furthermore , the ratio of sVEGFR-1 to PlGF was significantly lower in hematoma fluid than in serum ( p &lt ; 0.0001 ) . CONCLUSIONS Given previous evidence indicating a role for PlGF in promoting angiogenesis , inflammatory cell chemotaxis , and stimulation , as well as its ability to amplify VEGF-driven signaling under conditions favoring pathological angiogenesis , enhanced expression of PlGF in hematoma fluid suggests the involvement of this factor in the mechanisms of inflammation and angiogenesis in CSDH . Furthermore , a reduced ratio of sVEGFR-1 to PlGF in hematoma fluid is consistent with the proangiogenic capacity of CSDH . Future studies are warranted to clarify the precise role of PlGF and sVEGFR-1 in CSDH .	inducing angiogenesis;tumor promoting inflammation
23142824	Cellular senescence is a permanent out-of-cycle state regulated by molecular circuits acting during the G1 phase of the cell cycle . Cdt1 is a central regulator of DNA replication licensing acting during the G1 phase and it is negatively controlled by Geminin . Here , we characterize the cell cycle expression pattern of Cdt1 and Geminin during successive passages of primary fibroblasts and compare it to tumour-derived cell lines . Cdt1 and Geminin are strictly expressed in distinct subpopulations of young fibroblasts , similarly to cancer cells , with Geminin accumulating shortly after the onset of S phase . Cdt1 and Geminin are down-regulated when primary human and mouse fibroblasts undergo replicative or stress-induced senescence . RNAi-mediated Geminin knock-down in human cells enhances the appearance of phenotypic and molecular features of senescence . Mouse embryonic fibroblasts heterozygous for Geminin exhibit accelerated senescence compared to control fibroblasts . In contrast , ectopic expression of Geminin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts delays the appearance of the senescent phenotype . Taken together , our data suggest that changes in Geminin expression levels affect the establishment of senescence pathways .	enabling replicative immortality
23143302	Mps one binder 1a ( MOB1A ) and MOB1B are key components of the Hippo signaling pathway and are mutated or inactivated in many human cancers . Here we show that intact Mob1a or Mob1b is essential for murine embryogenesis and that loss of the remaining WT Mob1 allele in Mob1a(Δ/Δ)1b(tr/+) or Mob1a(Δ/+)1b(tr/tr) mice results in tumor development . Because most of these cancers resembled trichilemmal carcinomas , we generated double-mutant mice bearing tamoxifen-inducible , keratinocyte-specific homozygous-null mutations of Mob1a and Mob1b ( kDKO mice). kDKO mice showed hyperplastic keratinocyte progenitors and defective keratinocyte terminal differentiation and soon died of malnutrition. kDKO keratinocytes exhibited hyperproliferation , apoptotic resistance , impaired contact inhibition , enhanced progenitor self renewal , and increased centrosomes . Examination of Hippo pathway signaling in kDKO keratinocytes revealed that loss of Mob1a/b altered the activities of the downstream Hippo mediators LATS and YAP1 . Similarly , YAP1 was activated in some human trichilemmal carcinomas , and some of these also exhibited MOB1A/1B inactivation . Our results clearly demonstrate that MOB1A and MOB1B have overlapping functions in skin homeostasis , and exert their roles as tumor suppressors by regulating downstream elements of the Hippo pathway .	evading growth suppressors;resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling
23144635	Several germline single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) have been identified in the POLB gene , but little is known about their cellular and biochemical impact . DNA Polymerase β ( Pol β ) , encoded by the POLB gene , is the main gap-filling polymerase involved in base excision repair ( BER ) , a pathway that protects the genome from the consequences of oxidative DNA damage . In this study we tested the hypothesis that expression of the POLB germline coding SNP ( rs3136797 ) in mammalian cells could induce a cancerous phenotype . Expression of this SNP in both human and mouse cells induced double-strand breaks , chromosomal aberrations , and cellular transformation . Following treatment with an alkylating agent , cells expressing this coding SNP accumulated BER intermediate substrates , including single-strand and double-strand breaks . The rs3136797 SNP encodes the P242R variant Pol β protein and biochemical analysis showed that P242R protein had a slower catalytic rate than WT , although P242R binds DNA similarly to WT . Our results suggest that people who carry the rs3136797 germline SNP may be at an increased risk for cancer susceptibility .	genomic instability and mutation
23161852	Missense substitutions of uncertain clinical significance in the BRCA1 gene are a vexing problem in genetic counseling for women who have a family history of breast cancer . In this study , we evaluated the functions of 29 missense substitutions of BRCA1 in two DNA repair pathways . Repair of double-strand breaks by homology-directed recombination ( HDR ) had been previously analyzed for 16 of these BRCA1 variants , and 13 more variants were analyzed in this study . All 29 variants were also analyzed for function in double-strand break repair by the single-strand annealing ( SSA ) pathway . We found that among the pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 , all were defective for DNA repair by either pathway . The HDR assay was accurate because all pathogenic mutants were defective for HDR , and all nonpathogenic variants were fully functional for HDR . Repair by SSA accurately identified pathogenic mutants , but several nonpathogenic variants were scored as defective or partially defective . These results indicated that specific amino acid residues of the BRCA1 protein have different effects in the two related DNA repair pathways , and these results validate the HDR assay as highly correlative with BRCA1-associated breast cancer .	genomic instability and mutation
23167379	Breast cancer causes death due to distant metastases in which tumor cells produce matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) enzymes which facilitate invasion . Oleuropein , the main olive oil polyphenol , has anti-proliferative effects . This study aimed to investigate the effect of oleuropein on the metastatic and anti-metastatic gene expression in the MDA human breast cancer cell line . We evaluated the MMPs and TIMPs gene expression by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) in treated and untreated cells . This study demonstrated that OL may induce anti-metastatic effects on human breast cancer cells . We found that TIMP1,-3 , and -4 were over-expressed after all periods of incubation in treated cancer cells compared to untreated cells , while MMP2 and MMP9 genes were down-regulated , at least initially . Treatment of breast cancer cells with oleuropein could help in prevention of cancer metastasis by increasing the TIMPs and suppressing the MMPs gene expressions .	activating invasion and metastasis
23167425	Invasion and metastasis are the major causes of cancer-related death . Pharmacological or therapeutic interventions such as chemoprevention of the progression stages of neoplastic development could result in substantial reduction in the incidence of cancer mortality . ( -)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG ) , a promising chemopreventive agent , has attracted extensive interest for cancer therapy utilizing its antioxidant , anti- proliferative and inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion . In this study , we assessed the influence of EGCG on the proliferative potential of HeLa cells by cell viability assay and authenticated the results by nuclear morphological examination , DNA laddering assay and cell cycle analysis . Further we analyzed the anti-invasive properties of EGCG by wound migration assay and gene expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in HeLa cells . Our results indicated that EGCG induced growth inhibition of HeLa cells in a dose- and time- dependent manner . It was observed that cell death mediated by EGCG was through apoptosis . Interestingly , EGCG effectively inhibited invasion and migration of HeLa cells and modulated the expression of related genes ( MMP-9 and TIMP-1 ) . These results indicate that EGCG may effectively suppress promotion and progression stages of cervical cancer development .	resisting cell death;activating invasion and metastasis
23168408	The vacuolar H+-ATPase ( V-ATPase ) , a multisubunit proton pump , has come into focus as an attractive target in cancer invasion . However little is known about the role of V-ATPase in cell death and especially the underlying mechanisms remain mostly unknown . We used the myxobacterial macrolide archazolid B , a potent inhibitor of the V-ATPase , as an experimental drug as well as a chemical tool to decipher V-ATPase related cell death signaling . We found that archazolid induced apoptosis in highly invasive tumor cells at nanomolar concentrations which was executed by the mitochondrial pathway . Prior to apoptosis induction archazolid lead to the activation of a cellular stress response including activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha ( HIF1alpha ) and autophagy . Autophagy was induced at low concentrations of archazolid that do not alter pH in lysosomes and was shown by degradation of p62 or fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes . HIF1alpha was induced due to energy stress shown by a decline of the ATP level and followed by a shut down of energy consuming processes . As silencing HIF1alpha increases apoptosis , the cellular stress response was suggested to be a survival mechanism . We conclude that archazolid leads to energy stress which activates adaptive mechanisms like autophagy mediated by HIF1alpha and finally leads to apoptosis . We propose V-ATPase as a promising drugable target in cancer therapy caught up at the interplay of apoptosis , autophagy and cellular/metabolic stress .	resisting cell death
23169272	Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease at both the clinical and molecular levels . This heterogeneity may give rise to different therapy responses . Molecular profiling has facilitated identification of signatures for stratifying patients who would potentially benefit from given therapies . Previously , we reported on a subset of genes with the potential for predicting response of primary breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Herein , we report that patients with luminal ( estrogen receptor Î± [ ERÎ±]-expressing ) breast cancer were enriched for nonresponders . To identify novel factors that contribute to the survival of breast cancer cells , a loss-of-function screen was performed with a subset of genes overexpressed in patients with disease resistant to chemotherapy . This approach led us to identify protein phosphatase 1 , regulatory subunit 15B ( PPP1R15B ) as a factor with a potentially essential role in the survival of ERÎ±-positive breast cancer cells . Functional analyses showed that PPP1R15B depletion results in impaired proliferation due to unsuccessful transition of cells from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle , and apoptosis induction . Moreover , our data revealed a regulatory role for PPP1R15B in activating ERÎ± . Furthermore , a high level of PPP1R15B mRNA expression was associated with poor outcome following tamoxifen-based therapy . Accordingly , knockdown of PPP1R15B expression sensitized tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells to tamoxifen while reducing ERÎ± abundance in these cells . Our findings reveal a novel role for PPP1R15B in the survival and therapy response of ERÎ±-positive breast cancer and may open new avenues for tumor subtype-specific therapeutic strategies in the era of personalized medicine .	sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death
23172666	Benzyl isothiocyanate ( BITC ) is a dietary chemopreventive agent that inhibits the growth of various human cancer cells by causing apoptotic cell death . In this study , we demonstrate that BITC not only induces apoptosis but also induces autophagy in human hormone-sensitive ( Rv1 ) and -refractory ( PC3 ) prostate cancer cells . In BITC-treated cells , the induction of autophagy was detected by monitoring the processing of an autophagy marker protein , microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( LC3 ) , the aggregation of LC3 into granular structures and the formation of acidic organelles . Inhibition of autophagy using 3-methyladenine increased BITC-induced apoptosis , whereas the administration of caspase inhibitor suppressed BITC-induced cell death . Our data also showed that BITC inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner . The expression of phospho-mTOR ( Ser2481 ) , an indicator of mTOR intrinsic catalytic activity , and phospho-UNC-51-like kinase 1 ( Ser757 ) , a direct substrate of mTOR , were decreased in BITC-treated cells . However , the increased expression of phospho-mTOR ( Ser2448 ) , phospho-AKT ( Ser473 ) and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 were detected only in PC3 cells at later stages of BITC treatment . Collectively , our results show that BITC induces a protective autophagy response in Rv1 and PC3 cells through inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway . Activation of the AKT survival pathway was only observed in PC3 cells , representing a resistance mechanism of advanced prostate cancer upon BITC treatment . These findings could potentially contribute to the beneficial effect of BITC in prostate cancer treatments .	resisting cell death
23174591	OBJECTIVE To explore the clinical significance of miRNA-216a expression in pancreatic cancer . METHODS Fourteen patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy and 6 patients with benign pancreas lesions were examined for miR-216a expressions in the tumor or lesion tissues using Agilent Human miRNA Microarray ( V12.0 ) . The relationship between miR-216a expressions and the clinicopathological features of the patients was analyzed . RESULTS The expression of miRNA-216a was significantly lower in pancreatic cancer than in benign pancreas lesions ( P=0.000 ) . The expression of miRNA-216a was significantly correlated with the T stage of the tumor ( P=0.002 ) , but not with the patients ' age , gender , smoking status , tumor stage , lymph node metastases , distant metastasis , tumor differentiation , nerve invasion , vessel invasion or serum CA19-9 level ( P&gt;0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS The down-regulated expression of miR-216a in pancreatic cancer suggests the involvement of miR-216a in the tumorigenesis and development of pancreatic cancer. miR-216a may potentially serve as a novel tumor marker and also a prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis
23175176	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) likely play a role in many cancers even in never-smokers . We tried to find a model to explain the relationship between variation in PAH-related DNA adduct levels among people with similar exposures , multiple genetic polymorphisms in genes related to metabolic and repair pathways , and nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) capacity . In 111 randomly selected female never-smokers from the Golestan Cohort Study in Iran , we evaluated 21 SNPs in 14 genes related to xenobiotic metabolism and 12 SNPs in eight DNA repair genes . NER capacity was evaluated by a modified comet assay , and aromatic DNA adduct levels were measured in blood by32P-postlabeling . Multivariable regression models were compared by Akaike's information criterion ( AIC ) . Aromatic DNA adduct levels ranged between 1.7 and 18.6 per 10(8) nucleotides ( mean : 5.8 ± 3.1 ) . DNA adduct level was significantly lower in homozygotes for NAT2 slow alleles and ERCC5 non-risk-allele genotype , and was higher in the MPO homozygote risk-allele genotype . The sum of risk alleles in these genes significantly correlated with the log-adduct level ( r = 0.4 , p &lt ; 0.001 ) . Compared with the environmental model , adding Phase I SNPs and NER capacity provided the best fit , and could explain 17% more of the variation in adduct levels . NER capacity was affected by polymorphisms in the MTHFR and ERCC1 genes . Female non-smokers in this population had PAH-related DNA adduct levels three to four times higher than smokers and occupationally-exposed groups in previous studies , with large inter-individual variation which could best be explained by a combination of Phase I genes and NER capacity .	genomic instability and mutation
23180246	Arginine deprivation is a promising strategy for treating ASS-negative malignant tumors including melanoma . However , autophagy can potentially counteract the effectiveness of this treatment by acting as a pro-survival pathway . By combining tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) with arginine deprivation using ADI-PEG20 ( pegylated arginine deiminase ) , we achieved enhanced apoptosis and accelerated cell death in melanoma cell lines . This implies a switch from autophagy to apoptosis . In our current investigation , we found that TRAIL could induce the cleavage of two key autophagic proteins , Beclin-1 and Atg5 , in the combination treatment . Using specific inhibitors for individual caspases , we found that caspase-8 inhibitor could completely abolish the cleavage . Furthermore , caspase-8 inhibitor was able to fully reverse the enhanced cytotoxicity induced by TRAIL . Inhibitors for caspase-3 , 6 , 9 , and 10 were able to block the cleavage of these two autophagic proteins to some extent and correspondingly rescue cells from the cytotoxicity of the combination of TRAIL and arginine deprivation . In contrast , calpain inhibitor could not prevent the cleavage of either Beclin-1 or Atg5 , and was unable to prevent cell death . Overall , our data indicate that the cleavage of Beclin-1 and Atg5 by TRAIL-initiated caspase activation is one of the mechanisms that lead to the enhancement of the cytotoxicity in the combination treatment .	resisting cell death
23180582	Oncogene-induced senescence can provide a protective mechanism against tumour progression . However , production of cytokines and growth factors by senescent cells may contribute to tumour development . Thus , it is unclear whether induction of senescence represents a viable therapeutic approach . Here , using a mouse model with orthotopic implantation of metastatic melanoma tumours taken from 19 patients , we observed that targeting aurora kinases with MLN8054/MLN8237 impaired mitosis , induced senescence and markedly blocked proliferation in patient tumour implants . Importantly , when a subset of tumour-bearing mice were monitored for tumour progression after pausing MLN8054 treatment , 50% of the tumours did not progress over a 12-month period . Mechanistic analyses revealed that inhibition of aurora kinases induced polyploidy and the ATM/Chk2 DNA damage response , which mediated senescence and a NF-ÎºB-related , senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) . Blockade of IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB led to reversal of MLN8237-induced senescence and SASP . Results demonstrate that removal of senescent tumour cells by infiltrating myeloid cells is crucial for inhibition of tumour re-growth . Altogether , these data demonstrate that induction of senescence , coupled with immune surveillance , can limit melanoma growth .	enabling replicative immortality;genomic instability and mutation
23181114	Identifying prognostic factors for osteosarcoma ( OS ) aids in the selection of patients who require more aggressive management . CD133 has been found to be a prognostic factor of certain tumor types . However , the association between CD133 expression and the prognosis of OS remains unknown . In this study , we analyzed the association of CD133 expression in OS with clinical factors and overall survival , and further investigated its potential role in metastasis in vitro . We found CD133 expression in 65.7% ( 46/70 ) of OS samples using immunohistochemistry , and it was positively correlated with lung metastasis analyzed by Chi-square test ( P=0.002 ) and shorter overall survival time using the Kaplan-Meier method compared by log-rank test ( P=0.000 ) . Multivariate analysis showed that CD133 expression was an independent prognostic factor of patients with OS . To test for direct participation of CD133 , we separated CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells in the MG63 cell line using magnetic-activated cell sorting and found that CD133(+) cells were more active in migration by scratch wound-healing assay and invasion by Matrigel invasion assay compared with CD133(-) cells . Elevated mRNA expression of the stemness gene octamer-binding transcription factor 4 ( Oct-4 ) and NANOG , and the metastasis-related receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 ( CXCR4 ) were also found in CD133(+) cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . Thus , expression of CD133 was correlated with lung metastasis and poor prognosis in OS patients . CD133(+) cells may be a type of cancer stem cell with high expression of self-renewal capacity and metastasis-related genes .	activating invasion and metastasis
23182854	Ursolic acid ( UA ) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid with promising cancer chemopreventive properties . A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying anticancer activity of UA is needed for further development as a clinically useful chemopreventive agent . Here , we found that both endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress and autophagy were induced by UA in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells . Surprisingly , ER stress was identified as an effect rather than a cause of UA-induced autophagy . Autophagy-dependent ER stress protected the cells from UA-induced apoptosis through EIF2AK3-mediated upregulation of MCL1 . Activation of MAPK1/3 but not inhibition of MTOR pathway contributed to UA-induced cytoprotective autophagy in MCF-7 cells . Our findings uncovered a novel cellular mechanism involved in the anticancer activity of UA , and also provided a useful model to study biological significance and mechanisms of autophagy-mediated ER stress .	resisting cell death
23190890	Approximately 50% of melanomas require oncogenic B-RAF(V600E) signaling for proliferation , survival , and metastasis , and the use of highly selective B-RAF inhibitors has yielded remarkable , although short-term , clinical responses . Reactivation of signaling downstream of B-RAF is frequently associated with acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibitors , and the identification of B-RAF targets may therefore provide new strategies for managing melanoma . In this report , we applied whole-genome expression analyses to reveal that oncogenic B-RAF(V600E) regulates genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in normal cutaneous human melanocytes . Most prominent was the B-RAF-mediated transcriptional repression of E-cadherin , a keratinocyte-melanoma adhesion molecule whose loss is intimately associated with melanoma invasion and metastasis . Here we identify a link between oncogenic B-RAF , the transcriptional repressor Tbx3 , and E-cadherin . We show that B-RAF(V600E) induces the expression of Tbx3 , which potently represses E-cadherin expression in melanocytes and melanoma cells . Tbx3 expression is normally restricted to developmental embryonic tissues and promoting cell motility , but it is also aberrantly increased in various cancers and has been linked to tumor cell invasion and metastasis . We propose that this B-RAF/Tbx3/E-cadherin pathway has a critical role in promoting the metastasis of B-RAF-mutant melanomas .	activating invasion and metastasis
23201449	Phyllanthus urinaria is widely used as anti-inflammatory , antiviral , antibacterial , and anti-hepatotoxic medicines in almost every tropical country . However , scientific evidence supporting its use in cancer metastasis is limited , particularly osteosarcoma . We investigated the effect of P. urinaria extract ( PUE ) on cell viability , invasion , and migration in the human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cell line , and looked at the impact of PUE on several relevant proteases and signaling pathways . This study demonstrates that PUE , at a range of concentrations ( from 0 to 100 Î¼g/ml ) , concentration-dependently inhibited the migration/invasion capacities of Saos-2 without cytotoxic effects . Zymographic and western blot analyses revealed that PUE inhibited the urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( u-PA ) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2 ) enzyme activity , as well as protein expression . Western blot analysis also showed that PUE inhibits phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt . Testing of mRNA level , quantitative real-time PCR , and promoter assays evaluated the inhibitory effects of PUE on u-PA expression in Saos-2 cells . The chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay was reactive to the transcription protein SP-1 , which was inhibited by PUE . In conclusion , PUE suppresses human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cell invasion and migration by transcriptionally inhibiting u-PA via ERK and Akt signaling pathways . Therefore , PUE produces anti-metastatic activity in Saos-2 cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23201559	Many molecular mechanisms contribute to the development of doxorubicin resistance and different cancers can express wide and diverse arrays of drug-resistance genes . The aim of this study was to identify the changes in gene expression associated with the development of doxorubicin resistance in MCF7 breast cancer cell line . The doxorubicin resistant MCF7 cell line was developed by stepwise selection of MCF7 cells and was tested using the MTT assay . The alterations in gene expression were examined using the real-time based PCR array . The findings showed an up-regulation of many phase I/II metabolizing genes , specifically , the CYP1A1 and the CYP1A2 that were up-regulated by 206- and 96-fold respectively . Drug efflux pump genes were also up-regulated profoundly . TOP2A was strongly down-regulated by 202-fold . Many other changes were observed in genes crucial for cell cycle , apoptosis and DNA repair . The findings of this project imply that the development of doxorubicin resistance is a multi-factorial process .	genomic instability and mutation;resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling
23207622	AIM To investigate the role of delta-like ligand 4 ( DLL4 ) in the angiogenesis of high-grade malignant glioma . MATERIALS AND METHODS DLL4 expression and microvessel density ( MVD ) were detected by immunohistochemistry in 51 human high-grade malignant glioma tissue samples . The vessel maturation index ( VMI ) was calculated as the percentage of a-smooth muscle actin ( a-SMA)-positive vessels in relation to the amount of CD31-positive vessels . Double fluorescent immunostaining for CD31 and EphrinB2 or EphB4 was performed to identify the arterial ( EphrinB2 ) or venous ( EphB4 ) origins of glioma microvessels . RESULTS Strong immunostaining of DLL4 and a positive correlation of DLL4 with the MVD were observed in high-grade malignant gliomas . The VMI of the DLL4-positive group was significantly higher than that of the DLL4-negative group . However , no significant association was found between DLL4 and EphrinB2 or EphB4 in high-grade gliomas . CONCLUSION DLL4 may be an important regulator for vessel proliferation and maturation in human high-grade malignant gliomas .	inducing angiogenesis
23209410	Many viruses subvert the host cell's ability to mount and complete various DNA damage responses ( DDRs ) after infection . HCMV infection of permissive fibroblasts activates host DDRs at the time of viral deposition and during replication , but the DDRs remain uncompleted without arrest or apoptosis . We believe this was in part due to partitioning of the damage response and double strand break repair components . After extraction of soluble proteins , the localization of these components fell into three groups : specifically associated with the viral replication centers ( RCs ) , diffused throughout the nucleoplasm and excluded from the RCs . Others have shown that cells are incapable of processing exogenously introduced damage after infection . We hypothesized that the inability of the cells to process damage might be due to the differential association of repair components within the RCs and , in turn , potentially preferential repair of the viral genome and compromised repair of the host genome . To test this hypothesis we used multiple strategies to examine repair of UV-induced DNA damage in mock and virus-infected fibroblasts . Comet assays indicated that repair was initiated , but was not completed in infected cells . Quantitative analysis of immunofluorescent localization of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers ( CPDs ) revealed that after 24 h of repair , CPDs were significantly reduced in viral DNA , but not significantly changed in the infected host DNA . To further quantitate CPD repair , we developed a novel dual-color Southern protocol allowing visualization of host and viral DNA simultaneously . Combining this Southern methodology with a CPD-specific T4 endonuclease V alkaline agarose assay to quantitate repair of adducts , we found efficient repair of CPDs from the viral DNA but not host cellular DNA . Our data confirm that NER functions in HCMV-infected cells and almost exclusively repairs the viral genome to the detriment of the host's genome .	genomic instability and mutation
23209807	K-Ras dependent non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells are ' addicted ' to basal autophagy that reprograms cellular metabolism in a lysosomal-sensitive manner . Here we demonstrate that the xenophagy-associated kinase TBK1 drives basal autophagy , consistent with its known requirement in K-Ras-dependent NSCLC proliferation . Furthermore , basal autophagy in this context is characterised by sequestration of the xenophagy cargo receptor Ndp52 and its paralogue Tax1bp1 , which we demonstrate here to be a bona fide cargo receptor . Autophagy of these cargo receptors promotes non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling . We propose that this TBK1-dependent mechanism for NF-ÎºB signalling contributes to autophagy addiction in K-Ras driven NSCLC .	resisting cell death
23210792	Excessive exposure to solar UVA and UVB radiation is widely considered to cause skin cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma and basalioma . Direct UVB damage to skin cell DNA as well as UV-induced chronic skin inflammation , accelerated keratinocyte proliferation , inhibited apoptosis , and immunosuppression seem to underlie the UV-induced carcinogenesis . Also , UVB induces cytochrome P450 subfamilies ( CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 ) involved in metabolic activation of organic pro-carcinogens and their conversion to ultimate carcinogens . Here , the effects of several glycosylated and non-glycosylated plant polyphenols ( verbascoside , resveratrol , polydatin , rutin , and quercetin ) on the inflammatory , apoptotic , metabolic , and proliferative responses of cultured human epidermal keratinocytes ( HEK ) to non-cytotoxic doses of solar-simulated UVA+UVB and chemical mediators of UV signalling in HEK , 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole and squalene isolated from photo-oxidized skin surface lipids ( SSL ) , were evaluated . We showed that the stilbenes and quercetin being exposed to UV were photo-destroyed within a short period of time , while verbascoside and rutin were photo-stable . When SSL were exposed to UV , the stilbenes and quercetin remarkably accelerated photo-oxidation of alpha-tocopherol , squalene , and cholesterol fractions , whilst verbascoside protected them . Verbascoside invariably inhibited molecular pathways in HEK leading to inflammatory cytokine expression ( NFkappaB and EGFR/ERK phosphorylation ) , and cell proliferation ( EGFR nuclear translocation ) , and displayed a stimulus-specific effect on the metabolic axis aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR)-CYP1A1/CYP1B1 . By contrast , the stilbenes inhibited UV-connected inflammatory cytokines excluding IL-8 , but they prevalently stimulated NFkappaB , EGFR nuclear translocation and the AhR-CYP pathway . We conclude that , among the PPs investigated , verbascoside does interfere with multiple UV-sensitive signalling in HEK in a way that it could have a major impact on skin cancer chemoprevention .	sustaining proliferative signaling;tumor promoting inflammation
23217706	Reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a key eventduring tumorigenesis . Despite being known for decades ( Warburg effect ) , the molecular mechanisms regulating this switch remained unexplored . Here , we identify SIRT6 as a tumor suppressor thatregulates aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells . Importantly , loss of SIRT6 leads to tumor formation without activation of known oncogenes , whereas transformed SIRT6-deficient cells display increased glycolysis and tumor growth , suggesting that SIRT6 plays a role in both establishment and maintenance of cancer . By using a conditional SIRT6 allele , we show that SIRT6 deletion invivo increases the number , size , and aggressiveness of tumors . SIRT6 also functions as a regulator of ribosome metabolismby corepressing MYC transcriptional activity . Lastly,Sirt6 is selectively downregulated in several human cancers , and expression levels of SIRT6 predict prognosis and tumor-free survival rates , highlighting SIRT6 as a critical modulator of cancermetabolism . Our studies reveal SIRT6 to be a potent tumor suppressor acting to suppress cancer metabolism .	cellular energetics;genomic instability and mutation
23219618	The mechanisms by which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSC and HPC ) from myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) undergo ineffective production of blood cells and disease transformation into acute myeloid leukemia remain to be investigated . It has been confirmed that increased production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) under various pathological conditions impairs HSC self-renewal and causes HSC premature exhaustion and BM suppression primarily via induction of HSC senescence , and oncogene induces accumulation of ROS and DNA damage and subsequently cellular senescence , which functions as an important barrier to prevent the growth of transformed cells to form a neoplasia . Here we investigated whether MDS CD34(+) cells enriched with HSC and HPC undergo senescence through accumulation of ROS and DNA damage and their action mechanisms . In this study , the percentages of SA-Î²-gal positive senescent CD34(+) cells increased in lower-risk MDS patients , but not in higher-risk MDS and AML patients , compared to that of healthy controls . The increases were associated with an elevated expression of p21 but not the activation of p38 . Further study found that there were increased ROS and DNA damage in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells enriched with HSC progression from lower-risk MDS , higher-risk MDS to AML . Therefore , these data suggest that CD34(+) cells from patients with lower-risk MDS present p21 dependent premature senescence , increased accumulation of ROS and DNA damage in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells could contribute to this process ; however , CD34(+) cells from patients with higher-risk MDS could develop some mechanisms to uncouple ROS and DNA damage induced senescence .	enabling replicative immortality;avoiding immune destruction;genomic instability and mutation;tumor promoting inflammation
23229021	The endothelial cell-specific microRNA ( miRNA ) , miR-126 , is considered a master regulator of physiological angiogenesis . Transplanted mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) release soluble factors contributing to neoangiogenesis and cardiac repair . Therefore , we hypothesized that the over-expression of miR-126 may prolong MSC survival and enhance the cell secretome , thereby improving post-infarction angiogenesis and cardiac function . In this study , MSCs harvested from male C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow were infected in vitro with miR-126 ( MSC(miR-126) ) by using recombinant lentiviral vectors ; the control cells were either non-transfected or transduced with mock vectors ( MSC(null) ) . The results showed an increased secretion of angiogenic factors and a higher resistance against hypoxia in MSC(miR-126) compared with the control cells . The expression of the Notch ligand Delta-like ( Dll)-4 in the MSC(miR-126) group was also increased . For in vivo experiments , MSC(miR-126) cultures were intramyocardially injected into the infarct region of the hearts of female C57BL/6 mice ( an acute myocardial infarction model ) who had undergone ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery . The survival of MSC(miR-126) cultures , determined by Sry expression , was increased at 7 days after transplantation . MSC(miR-126)-treated animals showed significantly improved cardiac function as assessed by echocardiography 2 weeks later . The expression levels of angiogenic factors and Dll-4 in the infarcted myocardium were further increased by MSC(miR-126) compared with MSCs or MSC(null) cultures . Furthermore , fluorescent microsphere and histological studies revealed that myocardial blood flow and microvessel density were significantly increased in the MSC(miR-126)-transplanted animals . In addition , we found increased immature vessel proliferation following the transplantation of MSC(miR-126) cultures in which the expression of Dll-4 had been knocked down . However , blood vessels with lumen were barely detected , which indicated that Dll-4 plays a key role in tubulogenesis . We conclude that the transplantation of MSCs overexpressing miR-126 can further enhance functional angiogenesis in the ischemic myocardium possibly by the secretion of angiogenic factors and the activation of Dll-4 , thus increasing MSC survival . Therefore , MSCs modified with miR-126 may represent a novel and efficient therapeutic approach for ischemic angiogenesis and the improvement of cardiac function .	inducing angiogenesis
23238519	BACKGROUND : The p38Î± MAP kinase pathway is involved in inflammation , cell differentiation , growth , apoptosis and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² . The overproduction of these cytokines plays an important role in cancer . The aim of this work was to design a peptide inhibitor on the basis of structural information of the active site of p38Î± . METHODS : A tetrapeptide , VWCS as p38Î± inhibitor was designed on the basis of structural information of the ATP binding site by molecular modeling . The inhibition study of peptide with p38Î± was performed by ELISA , binding study by Surface Plasmon Resonance and anti-proliferative assays by MTT and flow cytometry . RESULTS : The percentage inhibition of designed VWCS against pure p38Î± protein and serum of HNSCC patients was 70.30 and 71.5% , respectively . The biochemical assay demonstrated the K(D) and IC(50) of the selective peptide as 7.22ï¿½10(-9)M and 20.08nM , respectively . The VWCS as inhibitor significantly reduced viability of oral cancer KB cell line with an IC(50) value of 10Î¼M and induced apoptosis by activating Caspase 3 and 7 . CONCLUSIONS : VWCS efficiently interacted at the ATP binding pocket of p38Î± with high potency and can be used as a potent inhibitor in case of HNSCC . GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE : VWCS can act as an anticancer agent as it potentially inhibits the cell growth and induces apoptosis in oral cancer cell-line in a dose as well as time dependent manner . Hence , p38Î± MAP kinase inhibitor can be a potential therapeutic agent for human oral cancer .	resisting cell death
23242809	MYC deregulation is common in human cancer . IG-MYC translocations that are modeled in EÎ¼-Myc mice occur in almost all cases of Burkitt lymphoma as well as in other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders . Deregulated expression of MYC results in increased mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) signaling . As tumors with mTORC1 activation are sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition , we used everolimus , a potent and specific mTORC1 inhibitor , to test the requirement for mTORC1 in the initiation and maintenance of EÎ¼-Myc lymphoma . Everolimus selectively cleared premalignant B cells from the bone marrow and spleen , restored a normal pattern of B-cell differentiation , and strongly protected against lymphoma development . Established EÎ¼-Myc lymphoma also regressed after everolimus therapy . Therapeutic response correlated with a cellular senescence phenotype and induction of p53 activity . Therefore , mTORC1-dependent evasion of senescence is critical for cellular transformation and tumor maintenance by MYC in B lymphocytes .	enabling replicative immortality
23249948	The activity of DNA methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1 ) is associated with diverse biological activities , including cell proliferation , senescence and cancer development . Here , we demonstrated that the HMG box-containing protein 1 ( HBP1 ) transcription factor is a new repressor of DNMT1 in a complex mechanism during senescence . The DNMT1 gene contains an HBP1-binding site at position -115 to -134bp from the transcriptional start site . HBP1 repressed the endogenous DNMT1 gene through sequence-specific binding , resulting in both gene-specific ( e.g. p16(INK4) ) and global DNA hypomethylation changes . The HBP1-mediated repression by DNMT1 contributed to replicative and premature senescence , the latter of which could be induced by Ras and HBP1 itself . A detailed investigation unexpectedly revealed that HBP1 has dual and complex transcriptional functions-both of which contribute to premature senescence . HBP1 both repressed the DNMT1 gene and activated the p16 gene in premature senescence . The opposite transcriptional functions proceeded through different DNA sequences and differential protein acetylation . While intricate , the reciprocal partnership between HBP1 and DNMT1 has exceptional importance , since its abrogation compromises senescence and promotes tumorigenesis . Together , our results suggest that the HBP1 transcription factor orchestrates a complex regulation of key genes during cellular senescence with an impact on overall DNA methylation state .	enabling replicative immortality
23250823	The aim of the present work was to study the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , mediated by bFGF signaling and its possible crosstalk with prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) in LNCaP and PC3-PSMA prostate cancer cell lines . PC3 cells stably transfected with PSMA gene were used for restoring PSMA expression . LNCaP and PC3-PSMA cells were exposed to 10ng/mL of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) . IL-6 production was measured by ELISA assay , and levels of PSMA expression were assessed by flow cytometry . AKT , ERK1/2 , and p38 phosphorylation were detected by Western blot. bFGF enhances IL-6 production in LNCaP and PC3-PSMA prostate cancer cells . The effect of bFGF on stimulating IL-6 secretion was greater in LNCaP than in PC3-PSMA cells . In the presence of bFGF , PSMA expression was activated after 4days of treatment in LNCaP and PC3-PSMA cells . This activation was not maintained after long term of treatment in both metastatic cell lines . Solely MAPKs pathways ( ERK1/2 and p38 ) were activated after bFGF stimulation in both metastatic cell lines , whereas AKT did not show any activation . The interference of the proinflammatory cytokine , IL-6 , with bFGF signaling and PSMA , should be of high clinical relevance in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer . In developing novel therapeutic modalities targeting IL-6 , significant attention should be given to PSMA and its inactivation to fight against prostate cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis;tumor promoting inflammation
23250910	MicroRNAs ( miRNAs or miR ) have been integrated into tumorigenic programs as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes . The miR-124 was reported to be attenuated in several tumors , such as glioma , medulloblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma . However , its role in cancer remains greatly elusive . In this study , we show that the miR-124 expression is significantly suppressed in human breast cancer specimens , which is reversely correlated to histological grade of the cancer . More intriguingly , ectopic expression of miR-124 in aggressive breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 strongly inhibits cell motility and invasive capacity , as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process . Also , lentivirus-delivered miR-124 endows MDA-MB-231 cells with the ability to suppress cell colony formation in vitro and pulmonary metastasis in vivo . Further studies have identified the E-cadherin transcription repressor Slug as a direct target gene of miR-124 ; its downregulation by miR-124 increases the expression of E-cadherin , a hallmark of epithelial cells and a repressor of cell invasion and metastasis . Moreover , knockdown of Slug notably impairs the motility of MDA-MB-231 cells , whereas re-expression of Slug abrogates the reduction of motility and invasion ability induced by miR-124 in MDA-MB-231 cells . These findings highlight an important role for miR-124 in the regulation of invasive and metastatic potential of breast cancer and suggest a potential application of miR-124 in cancer treatment .	activating invasion and metastasis
23251606	Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a clonal disease of plasma cells that remains incurable despite the advent of several novel therapeutics . In this study , we aimed to delineate the impact of snake venom extracted from Walterinnesia aegyptia ( WEV ) alone or in combination with silica nanoparticles ( WEV+NP ) on primary MM cells isolated from patients diagnosed with MM as well as on two MM cell lines , U266 and RPMI 8226 . The IC(50) values of WEV and WEV+NP that significantly decreased MM cell viability without affecting the viability of normal peripheral mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were determined to be 25 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml , respectively . Although both WEV ( 25 ng/ml ) and WEV+NP ( 10 ng/ml ) decreased the CD54 surface expression without affecting the expression of CXCR4 ( CXCL12 receptor ) on MM cells , they significantly reduced the ability of CXC chemokine ligand 12 ( CXCL12 ) to induce actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and the subsequent reduction in chemotaxis . It has been established that the binding of CXCL12 to its receptor CXCR4 activates multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate MM cell chemotaxis , adhesion , and proliferation . We found that WEV and WEV+NP clearly decreased the CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated activation of AKT , ERK , NFÎºB and Rho-A using western blot analysis ; abrogated the CXCL12-mediated proliferation of MM cells using the CFSE assay ; and induced apoptosis in MM cell as determined by PI/annexin V double staining followed by flow cytometry analysis . Monitoring the expression of B-cell CCL/Lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2 ) family members and their role in apoptosis induction after treatment with WEV or WEV+NP revealed that the combination of WEV with NP robustly decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic effectors Bcl-2 , Bcl(XL) and Mcl-1 ; conversely increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic effectors Bak , Bax and Bim ; and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential in MM cells . Taken together , our data reveal the biological effects of WEV and WEV+NP and the underlying mechanisms against myeloma cancer cells .	resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling
23255119	It is now largely accepted that ribosomal proteins may be implicated in a variety of biological functions besides that of components of the translation machinery . Many evidences show that a subset of ribosomal proteins are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis through modulation of p53 activity . In addition , p53-independent mechanisms of cell cycle arrest in response to alterations of ribosomal proteins availability have been described . Here , we identify human rpL3 as a new regulator of cell cycle and apoptosis through positive regulation of p21 expression in a p53-independent system . We demonstrate that the rpL3-mediated p21 upregulation requires the specific interaction between rpL3 and Sp1 . Furthermore , in our experimental system , p21 overexpression leads to a dual outcome , activating the G₁/S arrest of the cell cycle or the apoptotic pathway through mitochondria , depending on its intracellular levels . It is noteworthy that depletion of p21 abrogates both effects . Taken together , our findings unravel a novel extraribosomal function of rpL3 and reinforce the proapoptotic role of p21 in addition to its widely reported ability as an inhibitor of cell proliferation .	evading growth suppressors;resisting cell death
23255900	Cancer immunotherapies are designed to elicit T-cell responses that inhibit tumor growth . Previous studies have demonstrated that interleukin 21 ( IL-21 ) is a promising cytokine for cancer immunotherapy due to its ability to induce the immunity of T cells and natural killer cells , whereas blockade of the interaction of programmed death receptor-1 ( PD-1 ) with its ligand ( PD-L1 ) reduces peripheral tolerance . In the current study , we investigated IL-21 alone and in combination with soluble PD-1 ( sPD-1 ) for the treatment of experimental H22 murine hepatocarcinoma . The naked plasmids pmIL-21 and/or psPD-1 were used for local gene transfer by injection . In these assays , sPD-1 combined with IL-21 was found to significantly inhibit the growth of the tumors in mice . Combined treatment with IL-21 and sPD-1 enhanced the antitumor immune response compared with that induced by IL-21 alone . Combined treatment was found to increase CTL cytotoxicity , increase the number of CTLs and NK cells in splenocytes , upregulate the cytokines IFN-Î³ and IL-2 and downregulate IL-10 . Thus , immunotherapy with IL-21 in combination with sPD-1 was found to induce a more efficacious antitumor immune response , which may have potential clinical implications .	avoiding immune destruction
23255914	Cancer therapy with rapamycin has been successfully implemented for kidney cancer , glioblastoma and prostate cancer . However , there are few studies concerning the effects of rapamycin on the treatment of human melanoma . In this study , we investigated whether rapamycin may be a promising strategy for the effective treatment of melanoma and explored the possible mechanism for this by culturing M14 cells in vitro and treating with rapamycin at three concentrations ( 10 , 50 or 100 nmol/l ) . MDC and LC3B staining , western blot analysis , flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy were employed . We revealed that rapamycin induced autophagy and inhibited the proliferation of M14 cells in a concentration-dependent manner , Furthermore , western blot analysis revealed an upregulated expression of Bcl-2 and downregulated expression of Bax in M14 cells . In conclusion , rapamycin induced autophagy and inhibited the growth of M14 cells . The mechanism may involve regulation of the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins . Rapamycin appears to be a promising strategy for the effective treatment of melanoma .	resisting cell death
23255942	The prediction of response or severe toxicity and therapy individualisation are extremely important in cancer chemotherapy . There are few tools to predict chemoresponse or toxicity in cancer patients . We investigated the correlation between the induction and repair of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) using constant-field gel electrophoresis ( CFGE ) and evaluating cell cycle progression and the sensitivity of four cancer cell lines to 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) . Using a sulphorhodamine-B assay , colon carcinoma cells ( HCT116 ) were found to be the most sensitive to 5FU , followed by liver carcinoma cells ( HepG2 ) and breast carcinoma cells ( MCF-7 ) . Cervical carcinoma cells ( HeLa ) were the most resistant . As measured by CFGE , DSB induction , but not residual DSBs , exhibited a significant correlation with the sensitivity of the cell lines to 5FU . Flow cytometric cell cycle analysis revealed that 14% of HCT116 or HepG2 cells and 2% of MCF-7 cells shifted to sub-G1 phase after a 96-h incubation with 5FU . Another 5FU-induced cell cycle change in HCT116 , HepG2 and MCF-7 cells was the mild arrest of cells in G1 and/or G2/M phases of the cell cycle . In addition , 5FU treatment resulted in the accumulation of HeLa cells in the S and G2/M phases . Determination of Fas ligand ( Fas-L ) and caspase 9 as representative markers for the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis , respectively , revealed that 5FU-induced apoptosis in HCT116 and HepG2 results from the expression of Fas-L ( extrinsic pathway ) . Therefore , the induction of DNA DSBs by 5FU , detected using CFGE , and the induction of apoptosis are candidate predictive markers that may distinguish cancer cells which are likely to benefit from 5FU treatment and the measurement of DSBs using CFGE may aid the prediction of clinical outcome .	evading growth suppressors;sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death;genomic instability and mutation
23257893	BACKGROUND Sorafenib has recently been shown to reduce tumour growth in hepatoblastoma ( HB ) xenografts . The effect of a combined administration with cytostatic agents was now investigated . METHODS Cell viability after treatment with sorafenib and different cytostatic agents was evaluated in two HB cell lines ( HUH6 and HepT1 ) using MTT assay . ERK signalling was investigated by western blot , NOXA expression by rt-PCR , and formation of DNA adducts using immunocytology . NMRI mice bearing subcutaneous HUH6-derived tumours were treated with sorafenib alone or in combination with cisplatin . Tumour progression , viability , apoptosis , and vascularisation were monitored by tumour volume , AFP levels , TUNEL assay , and CD31 immunostaining , respectively . RESULTS The combination of sorafenib and cisplatin led to a remarkable decrease in cell viability . The cisplatin-induced enhanced ERK1/2 activation , but not NOXA expression and the formation of DNA adducts was partly abrogated by sorafenib . In HB xenografts , both , sorafenib and alternated application of sorafenib and cisplatin significantly reduced tumour growth ( P&lt;0.05 ) . Levels of AFP were lower in both treated groups ( P=0.08 ) . Relative apoptotic areas were increased ( P=0.003 ) . Mean vascular density was the lowest in the sorafenib/CDDP group ( P=0.02 ) . CONCLUSION The combination of sorafenib with cisplatin might be a promising treatment option for high risk or recurrent HB .	genomic instability and mutation;resisting cell death
23259762	Our study was to elucidate the mechanisms whereby BMS-345541 ( BMS , a specific IκB kinase β inhibitor ) inhibits the repair of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) and evaluate whether BMS can sensitize MCF-7 breast cancer cells ( MCF-7 cells ) to ionizing radiation ( IR ) in an apoptosis-independent manner . In this study , MCF-7 cells were exposed to IR in vitro and in vivo with or without pretreatment of BMS . The effects of BMS on the repair of IR-induced DSBs by homologous recombination ( HR ) and non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) were analyzed by the DR-GFP and EJ5-GFP reporter assays and IR-induced γ-H2AX , 53BP1 , Brca1 and Rad51 foci assays . The mechanisms by which BMS inhibits HR were examined by microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription PCR . The effects of BMS on the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to IR were determined by MTT and clonogenic assays in vitro and tumor growth inhibition in vivo in a xenograft mouse model . The results showed that BMS selectively inhibited HR repair of DSBs in MCF-7 cells , most likely by down-regulation of several genes that participate in HR . This resulted in a significant increase in the DNA damage response that sensitizes MCF-7 cells to IR-induced cell death in an apoptosis-independent manner . Furthermore , BMS treatment sensitized MCF-7 xenograft tumors to radiation therapy in vivo in an association with a significant delay in the repair of IR-induced DSBs . These data suggest that BMS is a novel HR inhibitor that has the potential to be used as a radiosensitizer to increase the responsiveness of cancer to radiotherapy .	genomic instability and mutation;resisting cell death
23264894	In spite of the fact that they occur at high rates , the clinical responses of BRAF(V600) mutant metastatic melanoma to BRAF inhibitors are usually short-lasting , with most cases progressing within less than 8 mo . Immunomodulatory strategies initiated after progression have recently been reported to be poorly efficient . By characterizing the immunological interactions between T cells and cancer cells in clinical material as well as the influence of the FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib on the immune system , we aimed at unraveling new strategies to expand the efficacy of adoptive T-cell transfer , which represents one of the most promising approaches currently in clinical development for the treatment of metastatic melanoma . Here we show that blocking the BRAF-MAPK pathway in BRAF signaling-addicted melanoma cells significantly increases the ability of T cells contained in clinical grade tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to recognize autologous BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro . Antitumor reactivity was improved regardless of the class of antigen recognized by tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells . Microarray data suggests that improved tumor recognition is associated with modified expression of MHC Class I-associated proteins as well as of heat-shock proteins . In conclusion , our preclinical data suggest that an appropriately timed sequential treatment of BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma with vemurafenib and adoptive T-cell transfer might result in synergistic antineoplastic effects owing to an increased immunogenicity of cancer cells .	avoiding immune destruction
23268707	Abstract Different cyclooxygenase ( COX)-2 inhibitors were known to cause different cell cycle changes . We investigated whether this different effect on cell cycle change was due to concentration-dependent effect . We investigated the effects of celecoxib , a COX-2 selective inhibitor , on cell cycle regulation in irradiated cancer cells that express high or low levels of COX-2 . Four stably COX-2 knocked-down or overexpressed cell lines were treated with various concentrations of celecoxib with or without radiation . Celecoxib differentially modulated the cell cycle according to the concentrations applied . G(1) arrest was induced at lower concentrations , whereas G(2)/M arrest was induced at higher concentrations in each cell line tested . Radiation-induced G(2)/M arrest was enhanced at lower concentrations but reduced at higher concentrations . The cutoff values to divide lower and higher concentrations were cell-type specific . Celecoxib treatment activated Cdc25C and inhibited p21 expression in both unirradiated and irradiated cells , regardless of COX-2 expression . Apoptosis was induced in irradiated cells 48 hours after treatment with celecoxib dependent of COX-2 . These results imply that celecoxib deactivates the G(2) checkpoint via both Cdc25C- and p21-dependent pathways in irradiated cells , which subsequently die by secondary apoptosis . Cell cycle modulating effects in irradiated cells resulting from treatment with celecoxib may have clinical importance with regard to the potential application of celecoxib in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy .	evading growth suppressors;sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death
23271730	The role of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-20 ( IL-20 ) has not yet been studied in cancer biology . Here , we demonstrated up-regulation of both IL-20 and IL-20R1 in muscle invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC ) patients . The expressions of IL-20 and IL-20R1 were observed in bladder cancer 5637 and T-24 cells . We found that IL-20 significantly increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-9 via binding activity of NF-ÎºB and AP-1 in bladder cancer cells and stimulated the activation of ERK1/2 , JNK , p38MAPK , and Jak-Stat signaling . Among the pathways examined , only ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 significantly inhibited IL-20-induced migration and invasion . Moreover , siRNA knockdown of IL-20R1 suppressed migration , invasion , ERK1/2 activation , and NF-ÎºB-mediated MMP-9 expression induced by IL-20 . Unexpectedly , cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1 was induced by IL-20 treatment without altering cell cycle progression . Blockade of p21WAF1 function by siRNA reversed migration , invasion , activation of ERK signaling , MMP-9 expression , and activation of NF-ÎºB in IL-20-treated cells . In addition , IL-20 induced the activation of IKK , the degradation and phosphorylation of IÎºBa , and NF-ÎºB p65 nuclear translocation , which was regulated by ERK1/2 . IL-20 stimulated the recruitment of p65 to the MMP-9 promoter region . Finally , the IL-20-induced migration and invasion of cells was confirmed by IL-20 gene transfection and by addition of anti-IL-20 antibody . This is the first report that p21WAF1 is involved in ERK1/2-mediated MMP-9 expression via increased binding activity of NF-ÎºB , which resulted in the induction of migration in IL-20/IL-20R1 dyad-induced bladder cancer cells . These unexpected results might provide a critical new target for the treatment of bladder cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis;evading growth suppressors;sustaining proliferative signaling
23272129	Human CD93 , an epidermal growth factor ( EGF)-like domain containing transmembrane protein , is predominantly expressed in the vascular endothelium . Studies have shown that AA4 , the homolog of CD93 in mice , may mediate cell migration and angiogenesis in endothelial cells . Soluble CD93 has been detected in the plasma of healthy individuals . However , the role of soluble CD93 in the endothelium remains unclear . Recombinant soluble CD93 proteins with EGF-like domains ( rCD93D123 , with domains 1 , 2 , and 3 ; and rCD93D23 , with domains 2 and 3 ) were generated to determine their functions in angiogenesis . We found that rCD93D23 was more potent than rCD93D123 in stimulating the proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . Production of matrix-metalloproteinase 2 increased after the HUVECs were treated with rCD93D23 . Further , in a tube formation assay , rCD93D23 induced cell differentiation of HUVECs through phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase and extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1/2 signaling . Moreover , rCD93D23 promoted blood vessel formation in a Matrigel-plug assay and an oxygen-induced retinopathy model in vivo . Our findings suggest that the soluble EGF-like domain containing CD93 protein is a novel angiogenic factor acting on the endothelium .	inducing angiogenesis
23274857	Breast cancer is the second most common cancer with a high incidence rate worldwide . One of the promising therapeutic approaches on breast cancer is to use the drugs that target the estrogen receptor ( ER ) . In the present investigation , marmorin , a type I ribosome inactivating protein from the mushroom Hypsizigus marmoreus , inhibited the survival of breast cancer in vitro and in vivo . It evinced more potent cytotoxicity toward estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells than ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells . Further study disclosed that marmorin undermined the expression level of estrogen receptor Î± ( ERÎ± ) and significantly inhibited the proliferation of MCF7 cells induced by 17Î²-estradiol . Knockdown of ERÎ± in MCF7 cells significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of marmorin on proliferation , suggesting that the ERÎ±-mediated pathway was implicated in the suppressive action of marmorin on ER-positive breast cancer cells . Moreover , marmorin induced time-dependent apoptosis in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells . It brought about G2/M-phase arrest , mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization and caspase-9 activation in MCF7 cells , and to a lesser extent in MDA-MB-231 cells . Marmorin triggered the death receptor apoptotic pathway ( e.g. caspase-8 activation ) and endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ERS , as evidenced by phosphorylation of PERK and IRE1Î± , cleavage of caspase-12 , and up-regulation of CHOP expression ) in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells . In summary , marmorin exhibited inhibitory effect on breast cancer partially via diminution of ERÎ± and apoptotic pathways mediated by mitochondrial , death receptor and ERS . The results advocate that marmorin is a potential candidate for breast cancer therapy .	sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death
23274876	A new line of human ovarian serous adenocarcinoma cells , TU-OS-4 , was established and characterized . The cells showed a short , spindle-shaped morphology and grew in monolayers without contact inhibition while forming an arrangement resembling a jigsaw puzzle . Chromosome numbers ranged from 55 to 73 . The proliferation rate was lower than other serous adenocarcinoma cell lines tested ( KF , SHIN-3 , and SK-OV-3 ) , and the doubling time was 53.3 h . Western blot analysis showed that TU-OS-4 cells overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor , human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) 2 , and phosphorylated HER2 protein . The IC(50) values to cisplatin , paclitaxel , and lapatinib were 25.8 μM , 686 nM , and 183 nM , respectively . Heterotransplantation in nude mice reflected the original tumor of the cells . These results suggested that this cell line would be useful to study chemoresistant mechanisms and contribute to establishing novel treatment strategies for patients with ovarian cancer .	evading growth suppressors;sustaining proliferative signaling
23274911	N-Ras is one member of a family of oncoproteins that are commonly mutated in cancer . Activating mutations in N-Ras occur in a subset of colorectal cancers , but little in known about how the mutant protein contributes to onset and progression of the disease . Using genetically engineered mice , we find that mutant N-Ras strongly promotes tumorigenesis in the context of inflammation . The pro-tumorigenic nature of mutant N-Ras is related to its anti-apoptotic function , which is mediated by activation of a non-canonical MAPK pathway that signals through Stat3 . As a result , inhibition of MEK selectively induces apoptosis in autochthonous colonic tumors expressing mutant N-Ras . The translational significance of this finding is highlighted by our observation that NRAS mutation correlates with a less favorable clinical outcome for colorectal cancer patients . These data demonstrate for the first time the important role that N-Ras plays in colorectal cancer .	resisting cell death;genomic instability and mutation
23275151	Platinum compounds are the foundation of chemotherapy regimens for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) despite poor response rates and limited response duration . It has been reported that tumor expression of ERCC1 , a key component in nucleotide excision repair , may correlate with clinical response to platinum agents . We found that most primary lung tumor specimens demonstrated a stronger protein expression of poly ( ADP ribose ) polymerases 1 ( PARP1 ) than their normal counterparts . We therefore hypothesized that combining PARP inhibition with platinum compounds may be an approach to improve platinum-based therapy for NSCLC . Drug combination experiments revealed that two distinct PARP inhibitors , olaparib and veliparib not only potentiated the cell killing by cisplatin but also conferred cytotoxicity as a single agent specifically in ERCC1-low HCC827 and PC9 but not in ERCC1-high A549 and H157 lung cancer cells . Moreover , siRNA knockdown of ERCC1 in A549 and H157 cells increased their sensitivities to both cisplatin and olaparib in a synergistic manner in our model . Furthermore , mechanistic studies indicated that combined PARP inhibitor and cisplatin could lead to sustained DNA double strand breaks , prolonged G2/M cell cycle arrest with distinct activation of checkpoint kinase 1 signaling , and more pronounced apoptosis preferentially in lung cancer cells with low ERCC1 expression . Collectively , these data suggest that there is a synergistic relationship between PARP inhibition and low ERCC1 expression in NSCLC that could be exploited for novel therapeutic approaches in lung cancer therapy based on tumor ERCC1 expression .	evading growth suppressors;genomic instability and mutation;resisting cell death
23276457	Bladder cancer ( BCa ) remained a major health problem . Med19 was related to tumor growth of BCa . Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) were reported to be critical in bone metastasis of cancer . We therefore investigated the relations between Med19 and BMPs in BCa and their effect on bone metastasis of BCa . Bladder cancer cell lines were cultured and interfered with Med19 shRNA and control . Expressions of BMP-1 , BMP-2 , BMP-4 , BMP-5 , BMP-6 , BMP-7 , BMP-9 , and BMP-15 were studied between 2 groups . Fifty-two BCa samples were included for immunohistochemical staining of Med19 and BMP-2 . Expressions were scored and studied statistically . Invasiveness was studied with Transwell assay . Silencing or Med19 in BCa cells induced altered expressions of BMPs . Increased expressions of BMP-1 , BMP-4 , BMP-6 , BMP-7 , and BMP-15 and decreased expressions of BMP-2 , BMP-5 , and BMP-9 were noticed , but only BMP-2 reached statistical significance . Expressions of Med19 and BMP-2 were significantly higher in cases with bone metastasis and were positively correlated in cases with bone metastasis and muscle invasion . Med19 is a critical factor involved in the invasiveness and promotion of bone metastasis of BCa , possibly via BMP-2 .	activating invasion and metastasis
23276719	Nectin-like molucule-5 ( Necl-5 ) is an immunoglobulin-like molecule that was originally identified as a poliovirus receptor and is often upregulated in cancer cells . It has been said that Necl-5 plays a role in not only cell-cell adhesion , but also cell migration , proliferation , and metastasis . In this study , we used a bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ( BAC ) cell line and fibroblasts to assess the expression of Necl-5 in the development of cancer-stroma communication by using an easy-to-prepare double-layered collagen gel hemisphere ( DL- CGH ) system that enables visualization of cell migration during invasion . The expression of Necl-5 was higher in BAC cells than in fibroblasts . This tendency didn't change even when the BAC cells were mixed with fibroblasts . To assess the role of Necl-5 in the invasive activity of the BAC cells , we knocked down its expression using RNA interference ( RNAi ) . The invasion assay with DL-CGH revealed that inhibitation of Necl-5 expression in the BAC cells was associated with suppressed invasiveness . In addition , Necl-5 knockdown inhibited the movement and proliferation of the BAC cells . Necl-5 expression in lung cancer cells is crucial for their invasiveness in the cancer-stromal interaction , suggesting that Necl-5 could be a favorable molecular target for the suppression of invasiveness in lung adenocarcinoma .	activating invasion and metastasis;sustaining proliferative signaling
23280187	The Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway regulates the viability and radiosensitivity of head and neck squamous cancer cells ( HNSCC ) . Increased Î²-catenin predisposes HNSCC patients to poor prognosis and survival . This study was conducted to determine the mechanism by which Î²-catenin regulates the viability of HNSCC . AMC-HN-3 , -HN-8 , UM-SCC-38 , and -SCC-47 cells , which were established from human head and neck cancer specimens , underwent cell death following Î²-catenin silencing. Î²-Catenin silencing significantly induced G1 arrest and increased the expression of Bax and active caspase-3 , which demonstrates the sequential activation of apoptotic cascades following treatment of HNSCC with targeted siRNA . Intriguingly , Î²-catenin silencing also induced autophagy . Here , we confirm that the number of autophagic vacuoles and the expression of type II light chain 3 were increased in cells that were treated with Î²-catenin siRNA . These cell death modes are most likely due to the activation of LKB1-dependent AMPK following Î²-catenin silencing . The activated LKB1/AMPK pathway in AMC-HN-3 cells caused G1 arrest by phosphorylating p53 and suppressing mTOR signaling . In addition , treating AMC-HN-3 cells with LKB1 siRNA preserved cell viability against Î²-catenin silencing-induced cytotoxicity . Taken together , these results imply that following Î²-catenin silencing , HNSCC undergo both apoptotic and autophagic cell death that are under the control of LKB1/AMPK . To the best of our knowledge , these results suggest for the first time that novel crosstalk between Î²-catenin and the LKB1/AMPK pathway regulates the viability of HNSCC . This study thus presents new insights into our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in Î²-catenin silencing-induced cell death .	resisting cell death
23280549	Growth differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ) and the CCN family member , connective tissue growth factor ( CCN2 ) , are associated with cardiac disease , inflammation and cancer . The precise role and signaling mechanism for these factors in normal and diseased tissues remains elusive . Here we demonstrate an interaction between GDF-15 and CCN2 using yeast two-hybrid assays and have mapped the domain of interaction to the von Willebrand factor type C domain of CCN2 . Biochemical pull down assays using secreted GDF-15 and His-tagged CCN2 produced in PC-3 prostate cancer cells confirmed a direct interaction between these proteins . To investigate the functional consequences of this interaction , in vitro angiogenesis assays were performed . We demonstrate that GDF-15 blocks CCN2-mediated tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial ( HUVEC ) cells . To examine the molecular mechanism whereby GDF-15 inhibits CCN2-mediated angiogenesis , activation of Î±(V) Î²(3) integrins and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) was examined . CCN2-mediated FAK activation was inhibited by GDF-15 and was accompanied by a decrease in Î±(V) Î²(3) integrin clustering in HUVEC cells . These results demonstrate , for the first time , a novel signaling pathway for GDF-15 through interaction with the matricellular signaling molecule CCN2 . Furthermore , antagonism of CCN2 mediated angiogenesis by GDF-15 may provide insight into the functional role of GDF-15 in disease states . J. Cell .

23281476	Elevated androgen receptor ( AR ) activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) may occur through increased levels of AR coactivator proteins . Vav3 , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) , is upregulated following progression to castration-resistance in preclinical models and is overexpressed in a significant number of human prostate cancers . Vav3 is a novel coactivator of the AR . We sought to identify Vav3 binding partners in an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Vav3 enhancement of AR activity and to identify new therapeutic targets . The cell division cycle 37 homolog ( Cdc37 ) , a protein kinase-specific co-chaperone for Hsp90 , was identified as a Vav3 interacting protein by yeast two hybrid screening . Vav3-Cdc37 interaction was confirmed by GST pulldown and , for native proteins , by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in prostate cancer cells . Cdc37 potentiated Vav3 coactivation of AR transcriptional activity and Vav3 enhancement of AR amino-carboxyl terminal ( N-C ) interaction , which is essential for optimal receptor transcriptional activity . Cdc37 increased prostate cancer cell proliferation selectively in Vav3 expressing cells . Cdc37 did not affect Vav3 nucleotide exchange activity , Vav3 protein levels or subcellular localization . Disruption of Vav3-Cdc37 interaction inhibited Vav3 enhancement of AR transcriptional activity and AR N-C interaction . Diminished Vav3-Cdc37 interaction also caused decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation selectively in Vav3 expressing cells . Taken together , we identified a novel Vav3 interacting protein that enhances Vav3 coactivation of AR and prostate cancer cell proliferation . Vav3-Cdc37 interaction may provide a new therapeutic target in prostate cancer .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23284890	CDA-2 ( cell differentiation agent 2 ) , a urinary preparation , has potent anti- proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties in cancer cells . However , the mechanisms of tumor inhibitory action of CDA-2 are far from clear , and especially there was no report on lung cancer . Here we demonstrate that CDA-2 and its main component phenylacetylglutamine ( PG ) reduce the metastatic lung tumor growth , and increases survival time after inoculation with Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) cells in a dose-dependent manner in C57BL6 mice . Proliferative program analysis in cancer cells revealed a fundamental impact of CDA-2 and PG on proliferation and apoptosis , including Bcl-2 , Bcl-XL , cIAP1 , Survivin , PCNA , Ki-67 proteins and TUNEL assays . CDA-2 and PG significantly reduced NF-ÎºB DNA-binding activity in lung cancer cells and in alveolar macrophages of tumor bearing mice and especially decreased the release of inflammatory factors including TNFÎ± , IL-6 , and KC . Furthermore , CDA-2 and PG decrease the expressions of TLR2 , TLR6 , and CD14 , but not TLR1 , TLR3 , TLR4 , and TLR9 in bone-marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDM ) of mice stimulated by LLC-conditioned medium ( LLC-CM ) . Over-expressing TLR2 in BMDM prevented CDA-2 and PG from inhibiting NF-ÎºB activation , as well as induction of TNFÎ± and IL-6 . TLR2:TLR6 complexes mediate the effect of NF-ÎºB inactivation by CDA-2 . In conclusion , CDA-2 potently inhibits lung tumor development by reduction of the inflammation in lung through suppression of NF-ÎºB activation in myeloid cells , associating with modulation of TLR2 signaling .	activating invasion and metastasis;resisting cell death;tumor promoting inflammation
23300534	Ovarian cancer , one of inflammation-associated cancers , is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women . Inflammation in the tumor microenvironment is associated with peritoneal tumor dissemination and massive ascites , which contribute to high mortality in ovarian cancer . Tumor suppressor p53 is frequently deleted or mutated in aggressive and high-grade ovarian cancer , probably aggravating cancer progression and increasing mortality . We therefore investigated the influence of p53 on proinflammatory chemokines in ovarian cancer cells . A PCR array of the chemokine network revealed that ovarian cancer cells with low or mutated p53 expression expressed high levels of proinflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1 , 2 , 3 and 8 . Transient transfection of p53 into p53-null ovarian cancer cells downregulated proinflammatory chemokines induced by tumor necrosis factor-Î± ( TNF ) , a proinflammatory cytokine abundantly expressed in ovarian cancer . Furthermore , p53 restoration or stabilization blocked TNF-induced NF-ÎºB promoter activity and reduced TNF-activated IÎºB . Restoration of p53 increased ubiquitination of IÎºB , resulting from concurrently reduced proteasome activity followed by stability of IÎºB . A ubiquitination PCR array on restoration of p53 did not reveal any significant change in expression except for Mdm2 , indicating that the balance between p53 and Mdm2 is more important in regulating NF-ÎºB signaling rather than the direct effect of p53 on ubiquitin-related genes or IÎºB kinases . In addition , nutlin-3 , a specific inducer of p53 stabilization , inhibited proinflammatory chemokines by reducing TNF-activated IÎºB through p53 stabilization . Taken together , these results suggest that p53 inhibits proinflammatory chemokines in ovarian cancer cells by reducing proteasomal degradation of IÎºB . Thus , frequent loss or mutation of p53 may promote tumor progression by enhancing inflammation in the tumor microenvironment .	genomic instability and mutation;tumor promoting inflammation
23300602	Activation of p53 effectively inhibits tumor angiogenesis that is necessary for tumor growth and metastasis . Reactivation of the p53 by small molecules has emerged as a promising new strategy for cancer therapy . Several classes of small-molecules that activate the p53 pathway have been discovered using various approaches . Here , we identified harmine ( Î²-carboline alkaloid ) as a novel activator of p53 signaling involved in inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth . Harmine induced p53 phosphorylation and disrupted the p53-MDM2 interaction . Harmine also prevented p53 degradation in the presence of cycloheximide and activated nuclear accumulation of p53 followed by increasing its transcriptional activity in endothelial cells . Moreover , harmine not only induced endothelial cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , but also suppressed endothelial cell migration and tube formation as well as induction of neovascularity in a mouse corneal micropocket assay . Finally , harmine inhibited tumor growth by reducing tumor angiogenesis , as demonstrated by a xenograft tumor model . Our results suggested a novel mechanism and bioactivity of harmine , which inhibited tumor growth by activating the p53 signaling pathway and blocking angiogenesis in endothelial cells .	evading growth suppressors;inducing angiogenesis;resisting cell death;sustaining proliferative signaling
23304196	Hormone antagonist therapy for estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) breast cancer patients post radical surgery and radiation therapy has a poor prognosis and also causes bone loss. 1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [ 1Î±,25(OH)(2)D(3) ] is a potent antitumor agent in pre-clinical studies , but caused hypercalcemia when its effective antitumor doses were used . Therefore , we investigated the effects of a less-calcemic 1Î±,25(OH)(2)D(3) analog , 19-nor-2Î±-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3 )(MART-10 ) , on ER+MCF-7 cells . We demonstrate that MART-10 is 500- to 1000-fold more potent than 1Î±,25(OH)(2)D(3) in inhibiting cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner . MART-10 is also much more potent in arresting MCF-7cell cycle progression at G(0)/G(1) phase as compared to 1Î±,25(OH)(2)D(3) , possibly mediated by a greater induction of p21 and p27 expression . Moreover , MART-10 is more active than 1Î±,25(OH)(2)D(3) in causing cell apoptosis , likely through a higher BAX/Bcl expression ratio and the subsequent cytochrome C release from mitochondria to cytosol . Based on our in vitro findings , MART-10 could be a promising vitamin D analog for the potential treatment of breast cancer , for example , ER+ patients , to decrease the tumor relapse rate and the side effect on bone caused by antihormone regimens . Thus , further in vivo animal study is warranted .	evading growth suppressors;sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death
23317200	Luteolin is a plant flavonoid which exhibits anti-oxidative , anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects . However , the antiproliferative potential of luteolin is not fully understood . In this study , we investigated the effect of luteolin on cell cycling and apoptosis in human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line Eca109 cells . MTT assays showed that luteolin had obvious cytotoxicity on Eca109 with an IC50 of 70.7ï¿½1.72 Î¼M at 24 h . Luteolin arrested cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase and prevented entry into S phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner. as assessed by FCM . Luteolin induced apoptosis of Eca109 cells was demonstrated by AO/EB staining assay and annexin V-FITC/PI staining . Moreover , luteolin downregulated the expression of cyclin D1 , survivin and c-myc , and it also upregulated the expression of p53 , in line with the fact that luteolin was able to inhibit Eca109 cell proliferation .	sustaining proliferative signaling;resisting cell death
23320127	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is still an incurable disease with resistance to therapy developing in the majority of patients . We investigated the effect of TPEN , an intracellular zinc chelator , in Jurkat and in ex vivo acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) cells resistant to chemotherapy . Changes of nuclei morphology , reactive oxygen species generation , presence of hypodiploid cells , phosphatidylserine translocation , mitochondrial membrane depolarization , immunohistochemical identification of cell death signalling molecules , and pharmacological inhibition were assayed to detect the apoptotic cell death pathways . We found that TPEN induces apoptosis in both types of cells by a molecular oxidative stress pathway involving O(2)(â¢-) &gt ; H(2)O(2) &gt ; NF-ÎºB ( JNK/c-Jun ) &gt;p53&gt ; loss ÎÎ¨(m)&gt ; caspase-3 , AIF &gt ; chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation . Interestingly , TPEN induced apoptosis independently of glucose ; leukemic cells are therefore devoid of survival capacity by metabolic resistance to treatment . Most importantly , TPEN cytotoxic effect can eventually be regulated by the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine and zinc ions . Our data suggest that TPEN can be used as a potential therapeutic prooxidant agent against refractory leukemia . These data contribute to understanding the importance of oxidative stress in the treatment of ALL .	resisting cell death;tumor promoting inflammation
23320197	The Punica granatum L. var. granatum ( pomegranate ) has been demonstrated to exert antitumor effects on various types of cancer cells . The present study aimed to evaluate the medicinal herbs Punica granatum L. var. spinosa ( apple punice ) that are native to Iran . This study was determined to test the possible cytotoxic activity and induction of apoptosis on human prostate cell lines . The effect of ethanol extracts of the herbs on the inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed by MTT colorimetric assay . PC3 cell lines treated with the extracts were analyzed for the induction of apoptosis by cell death detection ( ELISA ) and TUNEL assay . Dye exclusion analysis was performed for viability rate . Our results demonstrated that the Punica granatum L. var. spinosa extract dose dependently suppressed the proliferation of PC3 cells ( IC(50)= 250.21âÎ¼g/mL ) when compared with a chemotherapeutic anticancer drug ( Toxol ) ( Vesper Pharmaceuticals ) with increased nucleosome production from apoptotic cells . The Punica granatum L. var. spinosa extract attenuated the human prostate cell proliferation in vitro possibly by inducing apoptosis . The Punica granatum L. var. spinosa is likely to be valuable for the treatment of some forms of human prostate cell line .	resisting cell death
23339698	UVB is a major cause of nonmelanoma skin cancer in humans . Photochemoprevention represents an important strategy in protecting the skin against the detrimental effects of ultraviolet B ( UVB ) . We investigated the activity of Calluna vulgaris ( Cv ) delivered via a hydrogel on 3 main pathways ( oxidative stress , inflammation , DNA damage ) on skin exposed to multiple doses of UVB in SKH-1 mice . Fifty female mice were divided randomly into 5 groups : control , vehicle , UVB irradiated , Cv + UVB irradiated , and Cv + vehicle + UVB irradiated . The extract was applied topically on the skin in a dose of 4 mg polyphenols/cm2 30 minutes before each UVB ( 240 mJ/cm2 ) exposure over 10 consecutive days . Malondialdehyde , reduced glutathione , tumor necrosis factor-Î± , interleukin-6 , cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer ( CPD ) levels , sunburn cell formation and epidermal thickness , and the number of epidermal cell layers in skin were evaluated 24 hours after the last treatment . UVB increased cytokine levels ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) , formation of CPDs ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) and sunburn cells ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) , and the epidermal thickness and number of epidermal cell layers ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) compared with the control group . The topical application of Cv protected the skin against inflammation and DNA damage , as shown by a decreased number of CPDs ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) and sunburn cells ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) . The administration of Cv via hydrogel may be a viable method for chemoprevention. .	genomic instability and mutation;tumor promoting inflammation
23420486	We have previously shown that the antiprogestin and antiglucocorticoid mifepristone inhibits the growth of ovarian cancer cells . In this work , we hypothesized that cellular stress caused by mifepristone is limited to cytostasis and that cell killing is avoided as a consequence of the persistent activity of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway.To investigate the role of this pathway in mifepristone-induced growth inhibition , human ovarian cancer cells of various histological subtypes and genetic backgrounds were exposed to cytostatic doses of mifepristone in the presence or absence of the PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 . The activation of Akt in ovarian cancer cells , as marked by its phosphorylation on Ser473 , was not modified by cytostatic concentrations of mifepristone , but it was blocked upon treatment with LY294002 . The combination mifepristone/LY294002 , but not the individual drugs , killed ovarian cancer cells via apoptosis , as attested by genomic DNA fragmentation and cleavage of caspase-3 , and the concomitant down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and XIAP . From a pharmacological standpoint , when assessing cell growth inhibition using a median-dose analysis algorithm , the interaction between mifepristone and LY294002 was synergistic . The lethality caused by the combination mifepristone/LY294004 in two dimensional cell cultures was recapitulated in organized , tri-dimensional spheroids . This study demonstrates that mifepristone and LY294002 , when used individually , cause cell growth arrest , yet when combined , they cause lethality .	resisting cell death
23543859	Chronic alcohol ingestion increases hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 ( CYP2E1 ) , which is associated with hepatocarcinogenesis . We investigated whether treatment with chlormethiazole ( CMZ ) , a CYP2E1 inhibitor , protects against alcohol-associated hepatic carcinogenesis in rats . Rats were fed either an ethanol liquid diet or a non-ethanol liquid diet , with or without CMZ for one and ten months . A single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine ( DEN , 20 mg/kg ) was given to initiate hepatic carcinogenesis . CYP2E1 expression , inflammatory proteins , cell proliferation , protein-bound 4-HNE , etheno-DNA adducts , 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) , retinoid concentrations , and hepatic carcinogenesis were examined . Ethanol feeding for 1 month with DEN resulted in significantly increased hepatic CYP2E1 levels and increased nuclear accumulation of NF-κB protein and TNF-α expression , which were associated with increased cyclin D1 expression and p-GST positive altered hepatic foci . All of these changes induced by ethanol feeding were significantly inhibited by the one month CMZ treatment . At 10-months of treatment , hepatocellular adenomas were detected in ethanol-fed rats only , but neither in control rats nor in animals receiving ethanol and CMZ . The 8-OHdG formation was found to be significantly increased in ethanol fed animals and normalized with CMZ treatment . In addition , alcohol-reduced hepatic retinol and retinoic acid concentrations were restored by CMZ treatment to normal levels in the rats at 10 months of treatment . These data demonstrate that the inhibition of ethanol-induced CYP2E1 as a key pathogenic factor can counteract the tumor-promoting action of ethanol by decreasing TNF-α expression , NF-κB activation , and oxidative DNA damage as well as restoring normal hepatic levels of retinoic acid in DEN-treated rats .	genomic instability and mutation;tumor promoting inflammation
23717113	Previously , we reported that Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis and gastric cancer are closely associated with increased levels of hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) and that Korean red ginseng significantly reduced the severity of H. pylori-associated gastric diseases by attenuating H2S generation . Because the incubation of endothelial cells with H2S has been known to enhance their angiogenic activities , we hypothesized that the amelioration of H2S-induced gastric inflammation or angiogenesis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) might explain the preventive effect of Korean red ginseng on H. pylori-associated carcinogenesis . The expression of inflammatory mediators , angiogenic growth factors , and angiogenic activities in the absence or presence of Korean red ginseng extracts ( KRGE ) were evaluated in HUVECs stimulated with the H2S generator sodium hydrogen sulfide ( NaHS ) . KRGE efficiently decreased the expression of cystathionine Î²-synthase and cystathionine Î³-lyase , enzymes that are essential for H2S synthesis . Concomitantly , a significant decrease in the expression of inflammatory mediators , including cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase , and several angiogenic factors , including interleukin ( IL)-8 , hypoxia inducible factor-1a , vascular endothelial growth factor , IL-6 , and matrix metalloproteinases , was observed ; all of these factors are normally induced after NaHS . An in vitro angiogenesis assay demonstrated that NaHS significantly increased tube formation in endothelial cells , whereas KRGE pretreatment significantly attenuated tube formation . NaHS activated p38 and Akt , increasing the expression of angiogenic factors and the proliferation of HUVECs , whereas KRGE effectively abrogated this H2S-activated angiogenesis and the increase in inflammatory mediators in vascular endothelial cells . In conclusion , KRGE was able to mitigate H2S-induced angiogenesis , implying that antagonistic action against H2S-induced angiogenesis may be the mechanism underlying the gastric cancer preventive effects of KRGE in H. pylori infection .	inducing angiogenesis;tumor promoting inflammation
23825998	BACKGROUND Matrix metalloproteinases comprise a family of enzyme degrade components of extra cellular matrix . There are single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter regions of several genes with ability to influence cancer susceptibility . The aim of this study was to analyze association between MMP3 promoter polymorphisms and colorectal cancer occurrence and progression . MATERIALS AND METHODS In this case-control study 120 colorectal cancer patients and 100 controls were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) on the genomic deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . The patients group was divided into different subgroups : a subgroup without metastatic activity ( M(-) ) and a subgroup that had developed metastasis ( M(+) ) . RESULTS There was a significant difference in frequency of the MMP-3 genotype between cases and controls ( χ΂ = 16.17 ; P = 0.0003 ) . The 5A homozygote in patients and controls was significantly different . The frequency of the 5A allele among affected patients ( 67.91% ) was significantly higher than among the healthy controls ( 49% ; χ(2) = 16.17 , P = 0.00005 ) . At the time of diagnosis , individual who was carrying the 5A allele was more represented in the M(+) subgroup than in M(-) subgroup ( χ² = 7.49 ; P = 0.006 , OR = 3.86 ; 95% CI , 1.43-10.33 ) . The difference between M(-) and controls did not observe statistically significant ( χ² = 0.009 ; P = 0.92 ) . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the presence of 5A polymorphism at the MMP-3 promoter region may favor the growth and the metastasis process in colorectal cancer patients and could be looked at as a risk factor for a worse prognosis .	activating invasion and metastasis
24164383	BACKGROUND Alcohol consumption promotes hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The responsible mechanisms are not well understood . Hepatocarcinogenesis increases with age and is enhanced by factors that impose a demand for liver regeneration . Because alcohol is hepatotoxic , habitual alcohol ingestion evokes a recurrent demand for hepatic regeneration . The alcohol-preferring ( P ) rat model mimics the level of alcohol consumption by humans who habitually abuse alcohol . Previously , we showed that habitual heavy alcohol ingestion amplified age-related hepatocarcinogenesis in P rats , with over 80% of alcohol-consuming P rats developing HCCs after 18months of alcohol exposure , compared with only 5% of water-drinking controls . METHODS Herein , we used quantitative real-time PCR and quantitative immunocytochemistry to compare liver tissues from alcohol-consuming P rats and water-fed P rat controls after 6 , 12 , or 18months of drinking . We aimed to identify potential mechanisms that might underlie the differences in liver cancer formation and hypothesized that chronic alcohol ingestion would activate Hedgehog ( HH ) , a regenerative signaling pathway that is overactivated in HCC . RESULTS Chronic alcohol ingestion amplified age-related degenerative changes in hepatocytes , but did not cause appreciable liver inflammation or fibrosis even after 18months of heavy drinking . HH signaling was also enhanced by alcohol exposure , as evidenced by increased levels of mRNAs encoding HH ligands , HH-regulated transcription factors , and HH target genes . Immunocytochemistry confirmed increased alcohol-related accumulation of HH ligand-producing cells and HH-responsive target cells . HH-related regenerative responses were also induced in alcohol-exposed rats . Three of these processes ( i.e. , deregulated progenitor expansion , the reverse Warburg effect , and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions ) are known to promote cancer growth in other tissues . CONCLUSIONS Alcohol-related changes in Hedgehog signaling and resultant deregulation of liver cell replacement might promote hepatocarcinogenesis .	tumor promoting inflammation;activating invasion and metastasis;cellular energetics
24260065	Cancers are characterized by an increasing glycolytic activity , which is called the Warburg effect . Although this phenomenon is well known , the mechanism of the enhanced rate of glycolysis in cancer has not yet been clearly recognized . The present study investigated the glycolytic rate , regulatory enzymatic activities and the expression of phosphofructokinase-1 ( PFK-1 ) in human breast cancer and paracancer tissues . Human breast cancer tissues have an increased degree of glycolytic efficiency and regulatory enzymatic activities , which have been shown in previous studies . However , the present study identified a number of novel observations . The total PFK-1 levels were higher in human breast cancer tissues than in paracancer tissues , and further investigations revealed differential PFK-1 isoenzyme expression patterns between human breast cancer and paracancer tissues . The human breast cancer and paracancer tissues mainly expressed PFK-P and PFK-L isoforms , respectively . Linear-regression analysis showed that , depending on the pathological stage of breast cancer , the expression of PFK-P was significantly positively correlated with the activity of PFK-1 . Thus , during the development of human breast cancer , the enhancement of glycolytic activity depends primarily on the conversion of the PFK-1 , from PFK-L to PFK-P .	cellular energetics
24280190	BACKGROUND Aerobic glycolysis , namely the Warburg effect , is the main hallmark of cancer cells . Mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction has been proposed to be one of the major causes for such glycolytic shift . This hypothesis has been revisited as tumors appear to undergo waves of gene regulation during progression , some of which rely on functional mitochondria . In this framework , the role of mitochondrial complex I is still debated , in particular with respect to the effect of mitochondrial DNA mutations in cancer metabolism . The aim of this work is to provide the proof of concept that functional complex I is necessary to sustain tumor progression . METHODS Complex I-null osteosarcoma cells were complemented with allotopically expressed complex I subunit 1 ( MT-ND1 ) . Complex I re-assembly and function recovery , also in terms of NADH consumption , were assessed . Clones were tested for their ability to grow in soft agar and to generate tumor masses in nude mice . Hypoxia levels were evaluated via pimonidazole staining and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α ( HIF-1α ) immunoblotting and histochemical staining. 454-pyrosequencing was implemented to obtain global transcriptomic profiling of allotopic and non-allotopic xenografts . RESULTS Complementation of a truncative mutation in the gene encoding MT-ND1 , showed that a functional enzyme was required to perform the glycolytic shift during the hypoxia response and to induce a Warburg profile in vitro and in vivo , fostering cancer progression . Such trigger was mediated by HIF-1α , whose stabilization was regulated after recovery of the balance between α-ketoglutarate and succinate due to a recuperation of NADH consumption that followed complex I rescue . CONCLUSION Respiratory complex I is essential for the induction of Warburg effect and adaptation to hypoxia of cancer cells , allowing them to sustain tumor growth . Differently from other mitochondrial tumor suppressor genes , therefore , a complex I severe mutation such as the one here reported may confer anti-tumorigenic properties , highlighting the prognostic values of such genetic markers in cancer .	cellular energetics;genomic instability and mutation
