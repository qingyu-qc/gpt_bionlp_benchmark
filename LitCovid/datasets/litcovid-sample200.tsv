34216998	Multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and COVID-19: A pandemic year in Czechia. BACKGROUND: When the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared, concerns about its course in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) arose. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, severity and risk factors of the more severe COVID-19 course among MS and NMOSD patients. METHODS: From March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021, 12 MS centres, representing 70% of the Czech MS and NMOSD population, reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases via the Czech nationwide register of MS and NMOSD patients (ReMuS). The main outcome was COVID-19 severity assessed on an 8-point scale with a cut-off at 4 (radiologically confirmed pneumonia) according to the World Health Organisation s (WHO) COVID-19 severity assessment. RESULTS: We identified 958 MS and 13 NMOSD patients, 50 MS and 4 NMOSD patients had pneumonia, 3 MS and 2 NMOSD patients died. The incidence of COVID-19 among patients with MS seems to be similar to the general Czech population. A multivariate logistic regression determined that higher body mass index (BMI [OR 1.07, 95% CI, 1.00-1.14]), older age (OR per 10 years 2.01, 95% CI, 1.41-2.91), high-dose glucocorticoid treatment during the 2 months before COVID-19 onset (OR 2.83, 95% CI, 0.10-7.48) and anti-CD20 therapy (OR 7.04, 95% CI, 3.10-15.87) were independent variables associated with pneumonia in MS patients. Increase odds of pneumonia in anti-CD20 treated MS patients compared to patients with other disease-modifying therapy (same age, sex, BMI, high-dose glucocorticoid treatment during the 2 months before COVID-19 onset, presence of pulmonary comorbidity) were confirmed by propensity score matching (OR 8.90, 95% CI, 3.04-33.24). Reports on COVID-19 infection in patients with NMOSD are scarce, however, data available up to now suggest a high risk of a more severe COVID-19 course as well as a higher mortality rate among NMOSD patients. In our cohort, 4 NMOSD patients (30.77%) had the more severe COVID-19 course and 2 patients (15.39%) died. CONCLUSION: The majority of MS patients had a mild COVID-19 course contrary to NMOSD patients, however, higher BMI and age, anti-CD20 therapy and high-dose glucocorticoid treatment during the 2 months before COVID-19 onset were associated with pneumonia. Based on this study, we have already started an early administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and preferential vaccination in the risk group of patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34282376	Immunosuppression minimization in kidney transplant recipients hospitalized for COVID-19. Background: Immunosuppressed patients such as kidney transplant recipients (KTs) have increased mortality risk in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The role and management of chronic immunosuppressive therapies during COVID-19 must be characterized. Methods: Herein, we report the follow-up of a cohort of 47 KTs admitted at two Spanish Kidney Transplant Units, who survived COVID-19. The impact of the management of immunosuppression during COVID-19 on graft function and immunologic events was evaluated. Results: At least one immunosuppressive agent was withdrawn in 83% of patients, with antimetabolites being the most frequent. Steroids were generally not stopped and the dose was even increased in 15% of patients as part of the treatment of COVID-19. Although immunosuppressive drugs were suspended during a median time of 17 days, no rejection episodes or de novo donor-specific antibodies were observed up to 3 months after discharge, and no significant changes occurred in calculated panel reactive antibodies. Acute graft dysfunction was common (55%) and the severity was related to tacrolimus trough levels, which were higher in patients receiving antivirals. At the end of follow-up, all patients recovered baseline kidney function. Conclusions: Our observational study suggests that immunosuppression in KTs hospitalized due to COVID-19 could be safely minimized.	Treatment
34344331	COVID-19 inpatients with gastrointestinal onset: sex and care needs' differences in the district of Ferrara, Italy. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, but a presentation of the disease with digestive symptoms only may occur. This work was aimed at evaluating: (1) the prevalence of presentation with digestive symptoms only in our cohort of COVID-19 inpatients; (2) differences between patients with and without gastrointestinal onset; (3) differences among males and females with gastrointestinal presentation; (4) outcomes of the groups of subjects with and without gastrointestinal onset. METHOD: We retrospectively divided the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 into two groups: (1) the one with digestive symptoms (DSG) and (2) the other without digestive symptoms (NDSG). We compared the subjects of DSG with those of NDSG and males with females in the DSG group only, in terms of demographics (age, sex), inflammation and organ damage indexes, length of stay, in-hospital and 100-day mortality. RESULTS: The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms at presentation was 12.5%. The DSG group showed a prevalence of females, and these tended to a shorter hospital stay; DSG patients were younger and with a higher load of comorbidities, but no differences concerning inflammation and organ damage indexes, need for intensification of care, in-hospital and 100-day mortality were detected. Among DSG patients, males were younger than females, more comorbid, with higher serum CRP and showed a longer length of hospital stay. Survival functions of DSG patients, in general, are more favourable than those of NDSG if adjusted for sex, age and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The prevalence of gastrointestinal presentation among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 12.5%; (2) DSG patients were on average younger, more comorbid and with a prevalence of females, with a shorter hospital stay; (3) in the DSG group, males had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Score and needed a longer hospital stay; (4) DSG subjects seem to survive longer than those of the NDSG group.

34206567	Evaluation of Anti-SARS-Cov-2 S-RBD IgG Antibodies after COVID-19 mRNA BNT162b2 Vaccine. (1) Background: The evaluation of anti-spike protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) antibodies represents a useful tool to estimate the individual protection against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection; (2) Methods: We evaluated anti S-RBD IgG levels by indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay on Maglumi 800 (SNIBE, California) in 2248 vaccinated subjects without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, 91 vaccinated individuals recovered from COVID-19, and 268 individuals recovered from COVID-19 who had not been vaccinated. Among those who were healthy and vaccinated, 352 subjects performed a re-dosing after about 72 days from the first measurement. (3) Results: Anti S-RBD IgG levels were lower in subjects with previous infection than vaccinated subjects, with or without previous infection (p < 0.001). No difference was observed between vaccinated subjects, with and without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, anti-RBD IgG levels were higher in females than males (2110 vs. 1341 BAU/mL; p < 0.001) as well as in subjects with symptoms after vaccination than asymptomatic ones (2085 vs. 1332 BAU/mL; p = 0.001) and lower in older than younger subjects. Finally, a significant decrease in anti-RBD IgG levels was observed within a short period from a complete two-dose cycle vaccination. (4) Conclusions: Our results show an efficacy antibody response after vaccination with age-, time- and sex-related differences.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34222173	Data Sharing in Southeast Asia During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Background: When a new pathogen emerges, consistent case reporting is critical for public health surveillance. Tracking cases geographically and over time is key for understanding the spread of an infectious disease and effectively designing interventions to contain and mitigate an epidemic. In this paper we describe the reporting systems on COVID-19 in Southeast Asia during the first wave in 2020, and highlight the impact of specific reporting methods. Methods: We reviewed key epidemiological variables from various sources including a regionally comprehensive dataset, national trackers, dashboards, and case bulletins for 11 countries during the first wave of the epidemic in Southeast Asia. We recorded timelines of shifts in epidemiological reporting systems and described the differences in how epidemiological data are reported across countries and timepoints. Results: Our findings suggest that countries in Southeast Asia generally reported precise and detailed epidemiological data during the first wave of the pandemic. Changes in reporting rarely occurred for demographic data, while reporting shifts for geographic and temporal data were frequent. Most countries provided COVID-19 individual-level data daily using HTML and PDF, necessitating scraping and extraction before data could be used in analyses. Conclusion: Our study highlights the importance of more nuanced analyses of COVID-19 epidemiological data within and across countries because of the frequent shifts in reporting. As governments continue to respond to impacts on health and the economy, data sharing also needs to be prioritised given its foundational role in policymaking, and in the implementation and evaluation of interventions.

34199995	Asian-Origin Approved COVID-19 Vaccines and Current Status of COVID-19 Vaccination Program in Asia: A Critical Analysis. COVID-19 vaccination has started throughout the globe. The vaccination program has also begun in most Asian countries. This paper analyzed the Asian-origin COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination program status in Asia till March 2021 under three sections. In the first section, we mapped the approved vaccines that originated from Asia, their technological platforms, collaborations during vaccine development, and regulatory approval from other countries. We found that a total of eight Asian COVID-19 vaccines originated and got approval from three countries: China, India, and Russia. In the second section, we critically evaluated the recent progress of COVID-19 vaccination programs. We analyzed the overall vaccination status across the Asian region. We also calculated the cumulative COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in different Asian countries, vaccine rolling in 7-day average in various Asian countries, and COVID-19 vaccine per day doses administrated in several Asian countries. We found that China and India vaccinated the maximum number of people. Finally, we evaluated the factors affecting the COVID-19 vaccination program in Asia, such as vaccine hesitancy, basic reproduction numbers (R0) and vaccination campaigns, and the cost of the vaccines. Our analysis will assist the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program successfully in Asia.	Treatment
34226872	Fractional Model and Numerical Algorithms for Predicting COVID-19 with Isolation and Quarantine Strategies. In December 2019, a new outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted world-wide attention, the virus then spread rapidly in most countries of the world, the objective of this paper is to investigate the mathematical modelling and dynamics of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) with Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative in the presence of quarantine and isolation strategies. The existence and uniqueness of the solutions for the fractional model is proved using fixed point iterations, the fractional model are shown to have disease-free and an endemic equilibrium point.We construct a fractional version of the four-steps Adams-Bashforth method as well as the error estimate of this method. We have used this method to determine the numerical scheme of this model and Matlab program to illustrate the evolution of the virus in some countries (Morocco, Qatar, Brazil and Mexico) as well as to support theoretical results. The Least squares fitting is a way to find the best fit curve or line for a set of points, so we apply this method in this paper to construct an algorithm to estimate the parameters of fractional model as well as the fractional order, this model gives an estimate better than that of classical model.

34207055	microRNA Heterogeneity, Innate-Immune Defense and the Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 Infection-A Commentary. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the genus Betacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, possesses an unusually large single-stranded viral RNA (ssvRNA) genome of about ~29,811 nucleotides (nt) that causes severe and acute respiratory distress and a highly lethal viral pneumonia known as COVID-19. COVID-19 also presents with multiple ancillary systemic diseases and often involves cardiovascular, inflammatory, and/or neurological complications. Pathological viral genomes consisting of ssvRNA, like cellular messenger RNA (mRNA), are susceptible to attack, destruction, neutralization, and/or modulation by naturally occurring small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) within the host cell, some of which are known as microRNAs (miRNAs). This paper proposes that the actions of the 2650 known human miRNAs and other sncRNAs form the basis for an under-recognized and unappreciated innate-immune regulator of ssvRNA viral genome activities and have implications for the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 invasion, infection, and replication. Recent research indicates that both miRNA and mRNA abundance, speciation, and complexity varies widely amongst human individuals, and this may: (i) In part explain the variability in the innate-immune immunological and pathophysiological response of different human individuals to the initiation and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple tissue types; and (ii) further support our understanding of human biochemical and genetic individuality and the variable resistance of individuals to ssvRNA-mediated viral infection and disease. This commentary will briefly address current findings and concepts in this fascinating research area of non-coding RNA and innate-immunity with special reference to natural host miRNAs, SARS-CoV-2, and the current COVID-19 pandemic.

34293732	A perspective on hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infection control of COVID-19: usefulness of spatial separation between wards and airborne isolation unit. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed a considerable burden on hospitals and healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide, increasing the risk of outbreaks and nosocomial transmission to 'non-COVID-19' patients, who represent the highest-risk population in terms of mortality, and HCWs. Since HCWs are at the interface between hospitals on the one hand and the community on the other, they are potential reservoirs, carriers, or victims of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 cross-transmission. In addition, there has been a paradigm shift in the management of viral respiratory outbreaks, such as the widespread testing of patients and HCWs, including asymptomatic individuals. In hospitals, there is a risk of aerosol transmission in poorly ventilated spaces, and when performing aerosol-producing procedures, it is imperative to take measures against aerosol transmission. In particular, spatial separation of the inpatient ward for non-COVID-19 patients from that designated for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 as well as negative-pressure isolation on the floor of the ward, using an airborne infection isolation device could help prevent nosocomial infection.

34355577	Efficiency of pooled surveillance testing in academic labs to detect and inhibit COVID-19 outbreaks. Robust surveillance testing is a key strategic plan to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks and slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; however, limited resources, facilities and time often impair the implementation of a widespread surveillance effort. To mitigate these resource limitations, we employed a strategy of pooling samples, reducing reagent cost and processing time. Through utilizing academic faculty and labs, successful pooled surveillance testing was conducted throughout Fall 2020 semester to detect positive SARS-CoV-2 infections in a population of 4400 students. During the semester, over 25,000 individual COVID status evaluations were made by pooling eight individual samples into one quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. This pooled surveillance strategy was highly effective at detecting infection and significantly reduced financial burden and cost by $3.6 million.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34223287	PORTABLE SINGLE-LEAD ELECTROCARDIOGRAM DEVICE IS ACCURATE FOR QTc EVALUATION IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: Many commonly used drugs can prolong the QTc interval (QTc), which can lead to potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. In the current era of COVID-19 pandemic, it is worth mentioning that the disease itself and several drugs used for its treatment have been associated with QTc prolongation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the agreement and clinical precision of a portable single-lead ECG device to measure the QTc interval compared to the standard 12-lead ECG. METHODS: In sequential tests, QTc of ECG recordings obtained with the device KardiaMobile (KM-1L) (AliveCor(R)) were compared to QTc obtained with conventional 12-lead ECG. Agreement was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots and the Lin's concordance coefficient. Consistency between the two devices in determining QTc prolongation (QTc >/=470 ms in males, or >/=480 ms in females), was evaluated with kappa statistics. RESULTS: 128 patients with a presumed or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to a University Hospital were included. QTc intervals measured with KM were similar to QTc measured with conventional ECG (442.45+/-40.5 vs. 441.65+/-40.3 ms, p:0.15). Bland-Altman analysis showed no significant difference in QTc values (average difference of -0.797, 95% Limits Of Agreement:-13.179;11.585). Lin's concordance coefficient showed an excellent agreement (0.988, p<0.001). Concordance between the two devices for determining QTc prolongation was excellent (Kappa>0.90). CONCLUSION: ECG recordings obtained with KM-1L allow an accurate QTc interval assessment. Considering its simplicity of use, this approach has advantages over conventional ECG and can provide an alternative for the evaluation of QTc in hospitalized patients, during the current time of pandemic by COVID-19 and beyond.

34222134	A rare case of shingles after COVID-19 vaccine: is it a possible adverse effect? Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibit mild to moderate symptoms, whereas 15% of COVID-19 cases progress to pneumonia, some associated cutaneous findings are also reported as maculopapular eruptions, morbilliform rashes, urticaria, chickenpox-like lesions, and livedo reticularis. The inactivated COVID-19 vaccines are authorized for use in some countries including Turkey. Here, we report an unusual case of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation in a 68-year-old male patient who was vaccinated against COVID-19. The patient presented to family medicine clinic with a stinging sensation and pain radiating from the right side of his chest to his back. Physical examination revealed multiple pinheaded vesicular lesions upon an erythematous base occupying an area on his right mammary region and back corresponding to T3-T5 dermatomes. He reported that he got his second dose of COVID-19 vaccine 5 days ago. As COVID 19 decreases the cell-mediated immunity, it could also increase the risk of herpes zoster (HZ). Although the exact reason remains unsolved, vaccine-induced immunomodulation caused by live attenuated vaccines and attenuated alloreactivity caused by inactivated vaccines may be responsible mechanisms for the reactivation of HZ. Epidemiological studies are needed to clarify the possible connection between vaccination and reactivation of herpesvirus infections.	Case Report
34200249	Reversion of Gut Microbiota during the Recovery Phase in Patients with Asymptomatic or Mild COVID-19: Longitudinal Study. Patients with COVID-19 have been reported to experience gastrointestinal symptoms as well as respiratory symptoms, but the effects of COVID-19 on the gut microbiota are poorly understood. We explored gut microbiome profiles associated with the respiratory infection of SARS-CoV-2 during the recovery phase in patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. A longitudinal analysis was performed using the same patients to determine whether the gut microbiota changed after recovery from COVID-19. We applied 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to analyze two paired fecal samples from 12 patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Fecal samples were selected at two time points: during SARS-CoV-2 infection (infected state) and after negative conversion of the viral RNA (recovered state). We also compared the microbiome data with those from 36 healthy controls. Microbial evenness of the recovered state was significantly increased compared with the infected state. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the depletion of Bacteroidetes, while an abundance was observed with a tendency to rapidly reverse in the recovered state. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the infected state was markedly higher than that in the recovered state. Gut dysbiosis was observed after infection even in patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, while the composition of the gut microbiota was recovered after negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Modifying intestinal microbes in response to COVID-19 might be a useful therapeutic alternative.	Treatment
34207199	"Photobiomodulation Therapy as a Possible New Approach in COVID-19: A Systematic Review. COVID-19 is a viral disease characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Since then, researchers from all over the world have been looking for ways to fight this disease. Many cases of complications arise from insufficient immune responses due to low immunity, with intense release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can damage the structure of organs such as the lung. Thus, the hypothesis arises that photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) with the use of a low-level laser (LLLT) may be an ally approach to patients with COVID-19 since it is effective for increasing immunity, helping tissue repair, and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. This systematic review was performed with the use of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar databases with the following keywords: ""low-level laser therapy OR photobiomodulation therapy AND COVID-19"". The inclusion criteria were complete articles published from January 2020 to January 2021 in English. The exclusion criteria were other languages, editorials, reviews, brief communications, letters to the editor, comments, conference abstracts, and articles that did not provide the full text. The bibliographic search found 18 articles in the Pubmed/MEDLINE database, 118 articles on the Web of Science, 23 articles on Scopus, and 853 articles on Google Scholar. Ten articles were included for qualitative synthesis, of which four commentary articles discussed the pathogenesis and the effect of PBMT in COVID-19. Two in vitro and lab experiments showed the effect of PBMT on prevention of thrombosis and positive results in wound healing during viral infection, using the intravascular irradiation (ILIB) associated with Phthalomethyl D. Two case reports showed PBMT improved the respiratory indexes, radiological findings, and inflammatory markers in severe COVID-19 patients. One case series reported the clinical improvement after PBMT on 14 acute COVID-19 patients, rehabilitation on 24 patients, and as a preventive treatment on 70 people. One clinical trial of 30 patients with severe COVID-19 who require invasive mechanical ventilation, showed PBMT-static magnetic field was not statistically different from placebo for the length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit, but improved diaphragm muscle function and ventilation and decreased the inflammatory markers. This review suggests that PBMT may have a positive role in treatment of COVID-19. Still, the necessity for more clinical trials remains in this field and there is not sufficient research evidence regarding the effects of PBMT and COVID-19 disease, and there is a large gap."

34216513	Performing nasopharyngeal swabs-Guidelines based on an anatomical study. Nasopharyngeal swabs are performed to collect material for diagnosing diseases affecting the respiratory system, such as Covid-19. Yet, no systematic anatomical study defines concrete prerequisites for successfully targeting the nasopharyngeal mucosa. We therefore aim at simulating nasopharyngeal swabs in human body donors to characterize parameters allowing and supporting to enter the nasopharynx with a swab, while avoiding endangering the cribriform plate. With the aid of metal probes and commercial swabs a total of 314 nasopharyngeal swabs in anatomical head/neck specimens stemming from 157 body donors were simulated. Important anatomical parameters were photo-documented and measured. We provide information on angles and distances between prominent anatomical landmarks and particularly important positions the probe occupies during its advancement through the nares to the upper and lower parts of the nasopharynx and cribriform plate. Based on these data we suggest a simple and safe three-step procedure for conducting nasopharyngeal swabs. In addition, we define easily recognizable signals for its correct performance. Evaluations prove that this procedure in all specimens without deformations of the nasal cavity allows the swab to enter the nasopharynx, whereas a widespread used alternative only succeeds in less than 50%. Our data will be the key for the successful collection of nasopharyngeal material for detecting and characterizing pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, which have a high affinity to pharyngeal mucosa. They demonstrate that the danger for damaging the cribriform plate or olfactory mucosa with swabs is unlikely, but potentially higher when performing nasal swabs.	Diagnosis;Prevention

34132990	Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody is higher in younger Austrian blood donors. PURPOSE: Frequently the infection with coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be asymptomatic or provoke only mild symptoms. These cases often remain unnoticed, so it is difficult to estimate the actual numbers of infections. Aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody in Austrian blood donors. METHODS: 20,228 blood donors aged between 18 and 72 years resident in four Austrian federal states were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody between 5th of June and 4th of December 2020. To evaluate the impact of sex, age, AB0-blood group and donation period on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, multiple logistic regression was done. RESULTS: Our data reveal an anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 2.5% overall, significantly depending on the time point of blood donation: after the first Austrian lockdown the seroprevalence was lower compared to the following months, when the rate was constantly rising. While younger blood donors showed significantly higher seroprevalence, no differences were found concerning sex or AB0 blood group. CONCLUSION: Broad testing strategies are required to better determine the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Screening blood donors as a representative group for the adult population could be a valid tool to determine the number of recorded and unrecorded cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Diagnosis
34286136	Barriers and facilitators for clinical trial participation of underrepresented and non-underrepresented fibromyalgia patients: A cross-sectional internet survey. Background: There is a need of well-powered randomized clinical trials in fibromyalgia. However, challenges for recruitment are presented. This study aims to describe and assess the perception of barriers and facilitators and the associated factors for the participation of underrepresented and non-underrepresented fibromyalgia patients. Methods: We performed an online survey through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) targeting fibromyalgia patients from April 7 to July 3, 2020 during the COVID-19 stay home mandate and it was restricted to the United States of America. We described and compared the survey characteristics between underrepresented and non-underrepresented participants, and we performed logistic regression models to assess the associated factors with clinical trial participation. Results: In total, 481 completed the survey including 168 underrepresented fibromyalgia patients. Only (1) 11.09 % reported previous participation in clinical trials and the significant perceived barriers were investigator-related (lack of friendliness of research staff and the opportunity to receive the results) and center-related (privacy and confidentiality policies, and the institution's reputation); (2) the participation rate and perceived barriers and facilitators were similar between underrepresented and non-underrepresented patients; and was positively associated with low income, higher age, and clinical trial awareness from their physician; and negatively associated with the perception of investigator-related barriers; and (4) for the underrepresented population, the presence of emotional support. Conclusion: Our findings suggest low rates of participation, regardless of underrepresented population status. Strategies as involving their physician as liaison to increase the awareness of clinical trials, as well as improving patient-researcher communication should be considered in this population.

34281181	Antimicrobial Activity of Curcumin in Nanoformulations: A Comprehensive Review. Curcumin (CUR) is a natural substance extracted from turmeric that has antimicrobial properties. Due to its ability to absorb light in the blue spectrum, CUR is also used as a photosensitizer (PS) in antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy (aPDT). However, CUR is hydrophobic, unstable in solutions, and has low bioavailability, which hinders its clinical use. To circumvent these drawbacks, drug delivery systems (DDSs) have been used. In this review, we summarize the DDSs used to carry CUR and their antimicrobial effect against viruses, bacteria, and fungi, including drug-resistant strains and emergent pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. The reviewed DDSs include colloidal (micelles, liposomes, nanoemulsions, cyclodextrins, chitosan, and other polymeric nanoparticles), metallic, and mesoporous particles, as well as graphene, quantum dots, and hybrid nanosystems such as films and hydrogels. Free (non-encapsulated) CUR and CUR loaded in DDSs have a broad-spectrum antimicrobial action when used alone or as a PS in aPDT. They also show low cytotoxicity, in vivo biocompatibility, and improved wound healing. Although there are several in vitro and some in vivo investigations describing the nanotechnological aspects and the potential antimicrobial application of CUR-loaded DDSs, clinical trials are not reported and further studies should translate this evidence to the clinical scenarios of infections.

34217601	Use of face mask by blood donors during the COVID-19 pandemic: Impact on donor hemoglobin concentration: A bane or a boon. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 virus has caused the world's deadliest pandemic. Early April 2020, the Delhi Government made it compulsory for people to wear face masks while going outdoors to curb disease spread. Prolonged use of surgical masks during the pandemic has been reported to cause many adverse effects. Intermittent hypoxia has been shown to activate erythropoietin (EPO leading to increased hemoglobin mass. AIM: To analyze whether face mask induced intermittent hypoxia has any effect on the hemoglobin levels of healthy blood donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed donor data from 1st July 2019-31st December 2020 for hemoglobin distribution across hemoglobin ranges and donor deferral on basis of hemoglobin. Study population was divided into two cohorts Group 1- (1st July 2019-31 st March 2020): before implementation of mandatory face masks Group 2- (1st April 2020-31 st December 2020): after implementation of mandatory face masks RESULTS: Mean Hb of blood donors in Group 2 (15.01 +/- 1.1 g/dl) was higher than Group1 (14.49 +/- 1.15 g/dl), (p < 0.0001). 47.1 % group2 donors had Hb of 16.1-18 g/dl compared to group1 (38.4 %). 52.9 % group 2 donors had Hb between 12.5-15 g/dl compared to 61.6 % Group 1 (p < 0.05). Deferral due to anemia was lesser in group 2 compared to group 1 (p < 0.00001). Group 2 had significantly higher deferral due to high Hb (>18 gm/dl) was than Group 1 (p = 0.0039). CONCLUSION: This study including 19504 blood donors spanning over one and a half year shows that prolonged use of face mask by blood donors may lead to intermittent hypoxia and consequent increase in hemoglobin mass.

34204252	First Dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Reduces Symptom Duration and Viral Clearance in Healthcare Workers. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than one hundred million people since the beginning of the worldwide pandemic. In this study, data from a large hospital in central Italy was used to evaluate the impact of the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on SARS-CoV-2 infections in terms of the prevalence of symptomatic cases, symptom duration, and viral clearance timing. All vaccinated Healthcare Workers (HCWs) with positive RT-PCR by nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were divided into two cohorts (positive RT-PCR within day 12 and positive RT-PCR between day 13 and day 21 after first dose administration) and compared for the presence and duration of symptoms and the timing of viral clearance. The same variables were evaluated across HCWs with positive RT-PCR within 6 days after first dose administration and non-vaccinated HCWs with positive RT-PCR between 1 October 2020 and 28 February 2021. Eighteen HCWs tested positive on RT-PCR by NP swab from day 1 to day 12 after the 1st dose administration (incidence rate 6.2 x 10(-4)) and 5 HCWs from day 13 to day 21 (incidence rate 2.3 x 10(-4)). Symptom duration and viral clearance timing are significantly shorter in the cohort of HCWs with positive RT-PCR 12 days after the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. The administration of the first dose proved effective in reducing presence, symptom duration, and viral clearance even in HCWs vaccinated for less than 6 days. These results could have implications on public health and post-exposure prophylaxis.	Treatment;Diagnosis

Frequent screening of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic populations using antigen-based point of care tests (APOCT) is occurring globally with limited clinical performance data. The positive predictive value (PPV) of two APOCT used in the asymptomatic screening of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers (HCW) at continuing care (CC) sites across Alberta, Canada was evaluated. Between February 22 and May 2, 2021, CC sites implemented SARS-CoV-2 voluntary screening of their asymptomatic HCW. Onsite testing with Abbott Panbio or BD Veritor occurred on a weekly or twice weekly basis. Positive APOCT were confirmed with a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) reference method. A total of 71,847 APOCT (17,689 Veritor and 54,158 Panbio) were performed among 369 CC sites. Eighty-seven (0.12%) APOCT were positive, of which 39 (0.05%) confirmed as true positives using rRT-PCR. Use of the Veritor and Panbio resulted in a 76.6% and 30.0% false positive detection, respectively (p<0.001). This corresponded to a 23.4% and 70.0% PPV for the Veritor and Panbio, respectively. Frequent screening of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic HCW in CC, using APOCT, resulted in a very low detection rate and a high detection of false positives. Careful assessment between the risks vs benefits of APOCT programs and prevalence of infection in this population needs to be thoroughly considered before implementation.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34332823	Coronavirus Disease 2019-Induced Thyroiditis. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease that presents with acute respiratory symptoms that are well documented and sequelae that are yet to be fully understood. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 51-year old woman, recently diagnosed with COVID-19, who presented with symptoms including chest pain, palpitations, difficulty swallowing, and anterior neck discomfort. We ultimately diagnosed her with COVID-19-induced thyroiditis and discharged her on propranolol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Thyroiditis can present with symptoms similar to other etiologies like pulmonary embolism. We discuss the process of evaluating and treating thyroiditis. We further discuss the risk of administering iodinated contrast media that could further exacerbate thyroid dysfunction.	Case Report
34205018	Infectious Respiratory Diseases Decreased during the COVID-19 Pandemic in South Korea. Infectious respiratory diseases are highly contagious and very common, and thus can be considered as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We followed up the incidence rates (IRs) of eight infectious respiratory diseases, including chickenpox, measles, pertussis, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease, scarlet fever, rubella, and meningococcal disease, after COVID-19 mitigation measures were implemented in South Korea, and then compared those with the IRs in the corresponding periods in the previous 3 years. Overall, the IRs of these diseases before and after age- or sex-standardization significantly decreased in the intervention period compared with the pre-intervention periods (p < 0.05 for all eight diseases). However, the difference in the IRs of all eight diseases between the IRs before and after age-standardization was significant (p < 0.05 for all periods), while it was not significant with regard to sex-standardization. The incidence rate ratios for eight diseases in the pre-intervention period compared with the intervention period ranged from 3.1 to 4.1. These results showed the positive effects of the mitigation measures on preventing the development of respiratory infectious diseases, regardless of age or sex, but we need to consider the age-structure of the population to calculate the effect size. In the future, some of these measures could be applied nationwide to prevent the occurrence or to reduce the transmission during outbreaks of these infections. This study provides evidence for strengthening the infectious disease management policies in South Korea.	Prevention
34368648	Immunogenicity and Protective Efficacy of an Intranasal Live-attenuated Vaccine Against SARS-CoV-2. Global deployment of an effective and safe vaccine is necessary to curtail the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we evaluated a Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-based vectored-vaccine in mice and hamsters for its immunogenicity, safety and protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal administration of recombinant (r)NDV-S vaccine expressing spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 to mice induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG2a antibodies and T cell-mediated immunity. Hamsters immunised with two doses of vaccine showed complete protection from lung infection, inflammation, and pathological lesions following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Importantly, administration of two doses of intranasal rNDV-S vaccine significantly reduced the SARS-CoV-2 shedding in nasal turbinate and lungs in hamsters. Collectively, intranasal vaccination has the potential to control infection at the site of inoculation, which should prevent both clinical disease and virus transmission to halt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

34204614	Acceptability of Healthcare Professionals to Get Vaccinated against COVID-19 Two Weeks before Initiation of National Vaccination. Background and Objectives The greatest challenge vaccines face is that of acceptance from the general population. Healthcare professionals' (HCPs) recommendations have significant influence on general public vaccination behavior. The aim of this study was to assess the willingness of HCPs to get vaccinated against COVID-19, two weeks before initiation of vaccinations. Materials and Methods: We conducted an anonymous online survey from 11-15 December 2020 among HCPs by emails delivered from the local medical and nursing stuff associations. Results: The 71.1% of 656 HCPs intended to accept vaccination, 5.9% did not and 23% were still undecided. The acceptance rate was higher in physicians (76.5%) and significantly lower in nurses (48.3%). Most of the responders who intended to accept vaccination were males (p = 0.01), physicians (p = 0.001), older (p = 0.02), married (p = 0.054) with children (p = 0.001), and had treated patients with COVID-19 (p < 0.001). In the multivariate logistic regression, the predictors of HCPs willingness to get vaccinated were parenthood (OR = 4.19, p = 0.003), being a physician (OR = 2.79, p = 0.04), and treating confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients (OR = 2.87, p = 0.036). Conclusions: Low vaccination acceptance rate was found especially in nurses, and as this may have a negative impact in the vaccination compliance of the general public, interventional educational programs to enhance vaccination are crucial.

34212913	COVID-19 pandemic in an Italian obstetric department: sharing our experience. BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (or SARS-CoV 2) has significantly struck the healthcare system worldwide. Over the course of a few weeks, hospitals reorganized their internal structure entirely at any level of care, from the Emergency rooms to Departments, including all the medical specialties. METHODS: In order to cope with the contingent state of emergency, the Gynecology and Obstetrics Unit of the University Hospital in Udine introduced new protocols and guidance for the usual standard of care, ensuring a safe environment for both healthcare providers and patients. RESULTS: By a continuous update of scientific evidence, the department was able to increase capacity as well as maintain flexibility when a higher number of admissions was required. CONCLUSION: We aimed to share our experience, which provided a relevant lesson about what to expect and how to prepare a referral center for high-risk pregnancy in response to a pandemic such as COVID-19.

34376994	COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance: A Review. As the world continues to respond to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), there is a larger hidden threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) lurking behind. AMR remains worrisome in that the pathogens causing resistant infections to thrive in hospitals and medical facilities, putting all patients at risk, irrespective of the severity of their medical conditions, further compounding the management of COVID-19. This study aims to provide overview of early findings on COVID-19 and AMR as well as to provide recommendations and lesson learned toward improving antimicrobial stewardship. We conducted a rapid narrative review of published articles by searching PubMed and Google Scholar on COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance with predetermined keywords. Secondary bacterial infections play crucial roles in mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19. Research has shown that a minority of COVID-19 patients need antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections. Current evidence reiterates the need not to give antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis to patients with mild COVID-19 or to patients with suspected or confirmed moderate COVID-19 illness unless it is indicated. The pandemic has also brought to the fore the deficiencies in health systems around the world. This comes with a lot of lessons, one of which is that despite the advances in medicine; we remain incredibly vulnerable to infections with limited or no standard therapies. This is worth thinking in the context of AMR, as the resistant pathogens are evolving and leading us to the era of untreatable infections. There is a necessity for continuous research into understanding and controlling infectious agents, as well as the development of newer functional antimicrobials and the need to strengthen the antimicrobial stewardship programs.

34212751	Lessons from COVID-19 in South Africa: Keeping our environment clean should be the first law of health. In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the links between poor hygiene, unclean environments and human health cannot be overemphasised, particularly in South Africa with its high incidence of infectious diseases and overburdened health system. One very controllable factor that is often overlooked is the poor disposal of litter and waste management and its adverse effects on public health. By wearing masks, regular handwashing and sanitising, as well as making sure that neighbourhoods and public spaces are clean and safe, the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases can be prevented.

34206293	Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients Affected by Non-Communicable Diseases in Europe and in the USA. An international online patient community, Carenity, conducted a patient study in two independent waves among adults affected by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Europe and in the United States of America (USA). The study aimed to assess the real time impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the medical conditions of patients with NCDs, their access to health care, and their adaptation to daily life as well as to describe their sources of information on COVID-19 and their needs for specific information and support. During the pandemic, 50% of the patients reported a worsening of their medical condition, and 17% developed a new disease. Additionally, 26% of the respondents reported an impact of the pandemic on regular/long-term treatment intake. 54% of the patients felt very or completely socially isolated and reported a strong impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their stress level and state of mind, with higher levels observed in the USA compared to Europe. 59% of the respondents wished to have received additional information regarding the risks associated to their medical condition during the pandemic. Television was the most used source of information, whereas physicians were the most trusted one. This study describes the substantial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on NCD patients.	Prevention
34225540	Molecular detections of coronavirus: current and emerging methodologies. Introduction: Seven coronavirus species have been identified that can infect humans. While human coronavirus infections had been historically associated with only mild respiratory symptoms similar to the common cold, three coronaviruses identified since 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2, cause life-threatening severe respiratory syndromes. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a worldwide health emergency. Due to the lack of effective drugs and vaccination, rapid and reliable detection is of vital importance to control coronavirus epidemics/pandemics.Area covered: A literature search was performed in Pubmed covering the detections and diagnostics of SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. This review summarized the current knowledge of established and emerging methods for coronavirus detection. The characteristics of different diagnostic approaches were described, and the strengths and weaknesses of each method were analyzed and compared. In addition, future trends in the field of coronavirus detection were also discussed.Expert opinion: Nucleic acid-based RT-PCR is the current golden-standard of coronavirus detection, while immunoassays provide history of coronavirus infection besides diagnostic information. Integrated high-throughput system holds the great potential and is the trend of future detection and diagnosis of virus infection.	Diagnosis
34362053	Hospitalisation for Drug Infusion Did Not Increase Levels of Anxiety and the Risk of Disease Relapse in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease during COVID-19 Outbreak. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, immunomodulatory therapies and hospital admission were suspected to increase the risk of infection. Nevertheless, patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) treated with intravenous (i.v.) biologics had to move to hospitals for drug infusion. We investigated the impact of hospitalisation in patients with IBD. We conducted a survey including consecutive IBD patients initially in clinical and biochemical remission treated with biologics at the end of the first lockdown period. Patients underwent the normally scheduled clinical visits, performed at hospital for i.v.-treated patients or at home for patients treated with s.c. drugs. We administered to all patients the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire and other 12 questions, specifically related to COVID-19 and its implications. A total of 189 IBD patients were recruited, 112 (59.3%) treated with i.v. drugs and 77 (40.7%) with s.c. ones. No relapses were recorded in either group (hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized, p = ns), as well as which, COVID-19 infections were not demonstrated in patients in contact with people with suspected symptoms or directly experiencing them. The total HADS score obtained by the sum of all items was also almost identical between groups (37.1 +/- 2.8 vs. 37.2 +/- 2.8; p = 0.98). In patients treated with i.v. drugs receiving a televisit (n = 17), the rate of satisfaction with telemedicine (58.8%) was significantly lower compared with those treated with s.c. drugs (94.8%; p < 0.0005). Our results suggest that hospitalisation during the COVID-19 outbreak does not increase the risk of COVID-19 infection as well as the risk of IBD relapse; moreover, the similar levels of anxiety in both groups could confirm that there is no need to convert patients from i.v. to s.c. therapy.

34205487	Inflammatory Mechanisms in COVID-19 and Atherosclerosis: Current Pharmaceutical Perspectives. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with excess mortality worldwide. The cardiovascular system is the second most common target of SARS-CoV-2, which leads to severe complications, including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism, as well as other major thrombotic events because of direct endothelial injury and an excessive systemic inflammatory response. This review focuses on the similarities and the differences of inflammatory pathways involved in COVID-19 and atherosclerosis. Anti-inflammatory agents and immunomodulators have recently been assessed, which may constitute rational treatments for the reduction of cardiovascular events in both COVID-19 and atherosclerotic heart disease.

34201926	Coronaviruses in Bats: A Review for the Americas. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is the focus of attention as it has caused more than three million human deaths globally. This and other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, have been suggested to be related to coronaviruses that are hosted in bats. This work shows, through a bibliographic review, the frequency of detection of coronavirus in bats species of the Americas. The presence of coronavirus in bats has been examined in 25 investigations in 11 countries of the Americas between 2007 and 2020. Coronaviruses have been explored in 9371 individuals from 160 species of bats, and 187 coronavirus sequences have been deposited in GenBank distributed in 43 species of bats. While 91% of the coronaviruses sequences identified infect a single species of bat, the remainder show a change of host, dominating the intragenera change. So far, only Mex-CoV-6 is related to MERS-CoV, a coronavirus pathogenic for humans, so further coronavirus research effort in yet unexplored bat species is warranted.	Mechanism;Diagnosis;Transmission
34132627	Developing a Scale Measuring Patient Expectations and Service Quality of Hospitals in India during COVID-19. This paper develops a scale that measures the perceived service quality of hospitals during a pandemic. To develop the scale, data from 206 respondents from India, was subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The newly developed scale was named PAND-SERVQUAL, which includes factors namely, assistance, facility & layout, trust, empathy, promptness, and knowledge. The resulting scale is likely to be useful for researchers exploring service quality research and health care quality as well. Findings will facilitate understanding patient's expectations regarding the service quality of hospitals during a pandemic.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/00185868.2021.1939827 .

34209552	Peripheral Artery Disease and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: The Forgotten Diseases in COVID-19 Pandemic. Results from an Observational Study on Real-World Management. Background and Objectives: It is well established that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) as well abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) have an increased cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Despite this higher risk, PAD and AAA patients are often suboptimality treated. This study assessed the CV profile of PAD and AAA patients, quantifying the survival benefits of target-based risk-factors modification even in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: PAD and AAA patients admitted for any reason to the Vascular Unit from January 2019 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Biochemical and CV profiles as well as ongoing medical therapies were recorded. Benefits of CV risk-factors control were estimated using the SMART-REACH model. A follow-up visit during the year 2020 was scheduled. Results: A total of 669 patients were included. Of these, 190 showed AAA and 479 PAD at any stage. Only 54% of PAD and 41% of AAA patients were on lipid-lowering drugs with non-optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels for most of them. A better control of all modifiable CV risk-factors based on the current guidelines would offer an absolute risk reduction of the mean 10-year CV risk by 9% in PAD and 14% in AAA. Unfortunately, the follow-up visit was lost because of COVID-19 limitations. Conclusions: Lipid profiles of PAD and AAA patients were far from guideline-based targets, and medical management was suboptimal. In our center, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted on the strict surveillance required in these very high-risk patients. The achievement of guideline-based therapeutic targets would definitively confer additional significant benefits in reducing the CV risk in these patients.	Prevention;Treatment
34368407	Potential drug leads for SARS-CoV2 from phytochemicals of Aerva lanata: a Machine Learning approach. COVID-19 outbreak is the recently reported worldwide pandemic threat. As part of our interventions with machine learning and molecular simulation approaches, we report the inhibitory effect of thirty compounds reported from the sacred plant Aerva lanata. The predicted activity of the screened ligands are comparable with the one of the present medication, hydroxy chloroquine (HCQ), on the main protease (PDB:6YB7) of SARS-CoV-2. Our studies pointed out the effectiveness of the plant with twenty seven compounds having potential activity against the main protease compared to the reference HCQ. The robustness of some of the phytochemicals such as ervoside, which is only present in Aerva lanata computed to have very high anticoronavirus activity. The results are indicative of potential natural antivirus source, which subsidizes in thwarting the invasion of coronavirus into the human body. Many phytochemicals which are computed to be effective towards SARS-CoV-2 in this study are used as drugs for various other diseases. Perhaps these compounds could be attractive for the management of COVID-19, but clinical trials must be performed in order to validate this observation.	Mechanism;Treatment
34225188	Increased incidence of post-operative respiratory failure in patients with pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE: While studies have reported increased post-operative pulmonary complications with SARS-CoV-2 infection, many are limited by use of historical controls or focus on less severe respiratory complications. We characterized the association between pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 infection and post-operative respiratory failure (PORF). DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a single center retrospective cohort study in New York City between March 14-June 14, 2020. PATIENTS: Exclusion criteria were age < 18-years, obstetric procedures, absence of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and pre-operative respiratory failure. A total of 778 patients met criteria, of which 87 had SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome, PORF, included inability to extubate for >/=24 h or unplanned re-intubation within 5 days. Multiple exposures were measured including SARS-CoV-2 infection 4 weeks before or 5 days after surgery. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for pre-operative hypoxemia, oxygen use, and pneumonia as well as tachycardia, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Surgical Mortality Probability Model (S-MPM) index, and peri-operative blood transfusion. MAIN RESULTS: SARS-CoV patients had higher CCI (P = 0.007) and S-MPM scores (P = 0.02). The incidence of PORF was 16% versus 7% in uninfected comparators (P = 0.001). Amongst infected individuals, 39% exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 and PORF was more common in these patients compared to asymptomatic individuals (26% vs. 9%, P = 0.04). Adjusted analysis revealed increased odds of PORF with infection (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2-6.2). This persisted even when adjusting for probable mediators such as pre-operative hypoxemia. Infected patients also demonstrated increased adjusted odds of 30-day mortality (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.4-9.1). CONCLUSIONS: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 4 weeks before or 5 days after surgery is associated with increased odds of 5-day PORF and 30-day mortality. This supports delaying elective surgery, but questions remain regarding the applicability of this recommendation for asymptomatic patients needing urgent or semi-urgent procedures such as oncologic surgery.

34221930	Current and New Drugs for COVID-19 Treatment and Its Effects on the Liver. Corona virus disease (COVID)-19 is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (commonly referred to as SARS-CoV-2). In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Though the target organ for the virus is primarily the lungs, with the recent understanding of the pathobiology of this disease and the immune dysregulation associated with it, it is now clear that COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems. Several drugs and therapies have been tried or repurposed to combat the wrath posed by this disease. On October 22, 2020, the USA Food and Drug Administration approved remdesivir for use in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older). Several of the drugs being tried against COVID-19 have hepatotoxicity as their potential side effect. This review aims to provide the latest insights on various drugs being used in the treatment of COVID-19 and their effects on the liver.	Treatment
34228096	Risk of missing colorectal cancer with a COVID-adapted diagnostic pathway using quantitative faecal immunochemical testing. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has brought an unprecedented challenge to healthcare services. The authors' COVID-adapted pathway for suspected bowel cancer combines two quantitative faecal immunochemical tests (qFITs) with a standard CT scan with oral preparation (CT mini-prep). The aim of this study was to estimate the degree of risk mitigation and residual risk of undiagnosed colorectal cancer. METHOD: Decision-tree models were developed using a combination of data from the COVID-adapted pathway (April-May 2020), a local audit of qFIT for symptomatic patients performed since 2018, relevant data (prevalence of colorectal cancer and sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tools) obtained from literature and a local cancer data set, and expert opinion for any missing data. The considered diagnostic scenarios included: single qFIT; two qFITs; single qFIT and CT mini-prep; two qFITs and CT mini-prep (enriched pathway). These were compared to the standard diagnostic pathway (colonoscopy or CT virtual colonoscopy (CTVC)). RESULTS: The COVID-adapted pathway included 422 patients, whereas the audit of qFIT included more than 5000 patients. The risk of missing a colorectal cancer, if present, was estimated as high as 20.2 per cent with use of a single qFIT as a triage test. Using both a second qFIT and a CT mini-prep as add-on tests reduced the risk of missed cancer to 6.49 per cent. The trade-off was an increased rate of colonoscopy or CTVC, from 287 for a single qFIT to 418 for the double qFIT and CT mini-prep combination, per 1000 patients. CONCLUSION: Triage using qFIT alone could lead to a high rate of missed cancers. This may be reduced using CT mini-prep as an add-on test for triage to colonoscopy or CTVC.	Diagnosis;Prevention
34333726	Twelve Months with COVID-19: What Gastroenterologists Need to Know. Corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) is the latest global pandemic. COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and, apart from respiratory symptoms, patients often present with gastrointestinal symptoms and liver involvement. Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS), in this review, we report a practical up-to-date reference for the physician in their clinical practice with patients affected by chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases (inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, chronic liver disease) at the time of COVID-19. First, we summarised data on the origin and pathogenetic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. Then, we performed a literature search up to December 2020 examining clinical manifestations of GI involvement. Next, we illustrated and summarised the most recent guidelines on how to adhere to GI procedures (endoscopy, liver biopsy, faecal transplantation), maintaining social distance and how to deal with immunosuppressive treatment. Finally, we focussed on some special conditions such as faecal-oral transmission and gut microbiota. The rapid accumulation of information relating to this condition makes it particularly essential to revise the literature to take account of the most recent publications for medical consultation and patient care.

34220199	Structure and Function of Major SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Proteins. SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, has a genomic organization consisting of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), 4 structural proteins, and 9 accessory proteins. Relative of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, has genomic organization, which is very similar. In this article, the function and structure of the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are described in great detail. The nsps are expressed as a single or two polyproteins, which are then cleaved into individual proteins using two proteases of the virus, a chymotrypsin-like protease and a papain-like protease. The released proteins serve as centers of virus replication and transcription. Some of these nsps modulate the host's translation and immune systems, while others help the virus evade the host immune system. Some of the nsps help form replication-transcription complex at double-membrane vesicles. Others, including one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and one exonuclease, help in the polymerization of newly synthesized RNA of the virus and help minimize the mutation rate by proofreading. After synthesis of the viral RNA, it gets capped. The capping consists of adding GMP and a methylation mark, called cap 0 and additionally adding a methyl group to the terminal ribose called cap1. Capping is accomplished with the help of a helicase, which also helps remove a phosphate, two methyltransferases, and a scaffolding factor. Among the structural proteins, S protein forms the receptor of the virus, which latches on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor of the host and N protein binds and protects the genomic RNA of the virus. The accessory proteins found in these viruses are small proteins with immune modulatory roles. Besides functions of these proteins, solved X-ray and cryogenic electron microscopy structures related to the function of the proteins along with comparisons to other coronavirus homologs have been described in the article. Finally, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 residues of the proteome during the 2020 pandemic has been described. Some proteins are mutated more often than other proteins, but the significance of these mutation rates is not fully understood.	Mechanism
34290872	Unprovoked serotonin syndrome-like presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection: A small case series. Clinicians and researchers have reported an array of neurological abnormalities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and while serotonin excess has been observed we are unaware of reports of central nervous system serotonin toxicity in COVID-19. We present two cases that resemble serotonin syndrome in COVID-19, but without identifiable inciting medications. A 54-year-old with multiple sclerosis and diabetes mellitus presented with altered mental status. His altered sensorium was attributed to diabetic ketoacidosis, but his condition quickly deteriorated with fever to 105 degrees Fahrenheit, rigidity in all extremities, inducible clonus, and hyperreflexia. He was intubated and was treated for possible meningitis and seizure. Neurologic workup was negative for acute pathology. Despite acetaminophen, his core temperature remained elevated to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. He was treated with external cooling and cyproheptadine and within 48 h, his fever, rigidity, hyperreflexia, and clonus resolved. He was extubated and discharged home on day 14. A 72-year-old with hyperlipidemia was admitted with tremors, 4 days after testing positive for COVID-19. His symptoms rapidly worsened, and he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on day 3 in extremis, febrile to 104.4 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 180 beats per minute, and apparent whole body myoclonus. He was intubated and developed fever refractory to acetaminophen requiring external cooling. Extensive neurologic workup was negative. He received cyproheptadine and slowly improved. He was extubated and discharged to rehab on day 11. These cases represent a unique presentation in COVID-19 that must be considered and requires a high index of suspicion.	Case Report
34215120	Catalytic hairpin DNA assembly-based chemiluminescent assay for the detection of short SARS-CoV-2 target cDNA. Colorimetric sensors are recognized as a promising means for target molecule detection as they provide rapid, cost-effective, and facile sensing visible to the naked eye. Challenges remain though in terms of their detection sensitivity and specificity for short-length target genes. Herein, we demonstrate the successful combination of the catalytic hairpin DNA assembly (CHA) approach with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-mimicking techniques for a simple, sensitive, and sequence-specific colorimetric assay to detect short SARS-CoV-2 target cDNA. In the developed CHA-based chemiluminescent assay, a low concentration of target cDNA is continuously recycled to amplify dimeric DNA probes from two biotinylated hairpin DNA until the hairpin DNA is completely consumed. The dimeric DNA probes are effectively immobilized in a neutravidin-coated microplate well and then capture neutravidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase via biotin-neutravidin interactions, resulting in a sensitive and selective colorless-to-blue color change. The developed sensing system exhibits a high sensitivity with a detection limit of ~1 nM for target cDNA as well as the ability to precisely distinguish a single-base mismatched mutant gene within 2 h. As the proposed system does not require complex protocols or expensive equipment to amplify target cDNA, it has the potential to be utilized as a powerful tool to improve the detection sensitivity of target genes for clinical diagnostics with colorimetric detection.

34202098	"How Do Enveloped Viruses Exploit the Secretory Proprotein Convertases to Regulate Infectivity and Spread? Inhibition of the binding of enveloped viruses surface glycoproteins to host cell receptor(s) is a major target of vaccines and constitutes an efficient strategy to block viral entry and infection of various host cells and tissues. Cellular entry usually requires the fusion of the viral envelope with host plasma membranes. Such entry mechanism is often preceded by ""priming"" and/or ""activation"" steps requiring limited proteolysis of the viral surface glycoprotein to expose a fusogenic domain for efficient membrane juxtapositions. The 9-membered family of Proprotein Convertases related to Subtilisin/Kexin (PCSK) serine proteases (PC1, PC2, Furin, PC4, PC5, PACE4, PC7, SKI-1/S1P, and PCSK9) participate in post-translational cleavages and/or regulation of multiple secretory proteins. The type-I membrane-bound Furin and SKI-1/S1P are the major convertases responsible for the processing of surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses. Stefan Kunz has considerably contributed to define the role of SKI-1/S1P in the activation of arenaviruses causing hemorrhagic fever. Furin was recently implicated in the activation of the spike S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and Furin-inhibitors are being tested as antivirals in COVID-19. Other members of the PCSK-family are also implicated in some viral infections, such as PCSK9 in Dengue. Herein, we summarize the various functions of the PCSKs and present arguments whereby their inhibition could represent a powerful arsenal to limit viral infections causing the present and future pandemics."

34224078	SARS-CoV-2 seroepidemiological study in healthcare workers and discordant results using seven different diagnostic methods. The aim of the study was to access the SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in healthcare workers (HCWs) of a tertiary pediatric hospital after the first wave of the pandemic and to compare the results among seven commercially available antibody detection assays, including chemiluminescence (CMIA), electroluminescence (ECLIA), Epsilonnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and rapid immunochromatography (RIC). SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection was performed in serum samples of 1216 HCWs, using a reference CMIA assay and 8/1216 (0.66%) were detected positive. Positive serum samples were further tested with other assays; however, only one sample was positive by all tests. The rest 7 cases were negative with ECLIA and ELISA and gave discordant results with RIC test. Six months later, new serum samples of seropositive HCWs were analyzed with the same 7 tests, with inconsistent results again. Identification of reliable SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests is important to determine the actual number of past infections, the duration of antibodies, and guide public health decisions.	Diagnosis
34226884	Physician Satisfaction With Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mayo Clinic Florida Experience. Objective: To evaluate physician perceptions and attitudes toward telemedicine use at a tertiary care academic institution in northeast Florida during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Patients and Methods: An anonymous 38-question cross-sectional survey was developed using Qualtrics survey software (Qualtrics) and e-mailed to all staff physicians from all specialty disciplines at Mayo Clinic in Florida. The survey was open from August 17, 2020, through September 1, 2020. Collected data included general demographic characteristics and employment information, attitude and experience with telemedicine use before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, perception of patients' experience, and the effect of telemedicine on burnout. Results: The survey was distributed to 529 eligible physicians at our institution, with 103 physicians responding (20%). The distribution of specialties was 22% primary care specialties, 41% other internal medicine subspecialties, and 18% surgical specialties. Collectively, 63% found comparable quality of care when provided virtually (vs in-person) whereas 80% perceived telemedicine as cost-effective. A total of 76% of physicians felt that telemedicine increased flexibility and control over patient care activities, with 36% reporting improved work-life balance and 30% reporting improved burnout symptoms. Overall, 42% preferred using telemedicine over in-person visits when possible. Conclusion: Physicians generally had positive attitudes regarding the adoption of telemedicine and perceived that the quality of health care delivery as generally comparable to in-person care. Future studies are needed to explore attitudes regarding telemedicine after the pandemic and how this virtual technology may be further used to improve physicians' professional and personal well-being.

34229034	Safety and structural integrity of N95/PFF2 respirators decontamination. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, an emerging respiratory pathogen. The work environment represents a high-risk factor for health professionals. Given the scarcity of protective personal equipment due to global demand, decontamination and reuse studies should be carried out. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of a method of decontamination of N95/PFF2 respirators, especially regarding structural integrity. METHODS: N95/PFF2 respirators were subjected to hydrogen peroxide decontamination and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Seven respirators of the same brand and lot were used, one being a control and the other six subjected to decontamination process. As for the sealing, a qualitative test was applied, in order to identify the changes in the structure that could damage the sealing of respirators. RESULTS: Indicated that the fiber morphology in all layers was not affected by the six decontamination cycles. Also, the thermal stability in the different layers was very similar. Fit testing showed that the respiradors submitted to all cycles of decontamination were approved. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, it is possible to conclude that the hydrogen peroxide decontamination method is effective, since it does not alter the physical properties of the respirators.	Prevention
34205306	Predictors of COVID-19-Related Perceived Improvements in Dietary Health: Results from a US Cross-Sectional Study. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in substantial lifestyle changes. No US study has identified predictors of perceived dietary healthfulness changes during the pandemic period. This study included analyses of lifestyle and dietary healthfulness changes using 958 survey responses from US primary household food purchasers. Information was collected related to demographics, COVID-19-related household changes, and health-related habits before and during the pandemic. Binary logistic regression identified predictors of perceived increase in dietary healthfulness during the pandemic period. Overall, 59.8%, 16.4%, and 23.4% of participants reported that their eating habits likely changed, may have changed, and likely did not change, respectively. Of the participants whose dietary habits likely or may have changed, 64.1%, 16.8%, and 19% reported healthier, neither healthier nor less healthy, and less healthy eating habits, respectively. COVID-19-related income loss, more meals consumed with household members in front of the television, an increase in food advertisement exposure, increased perceived stress, and better perceived current health were significant predictors of a perceived increase in dietary healthfulness. Overall, dietary habits were perceived to become healthier during the pandemic. The predictors of perceived improvement in dietary healthfulness were surprising and indicate the need for further study of these factors in crisis and noncrisis situations.	Prevention
34199900	Using Bus Ticketing Big Data to Investigate the Behaviors of the Population Flow of Chinese Suburban Residents in the Post-COVID-19 Phase. Large-scale population movements can turn local diseases into widespread epidemics. Grasping the characteristic of the population flow in the context of the COVID-19 is of great significance for providing information to epidemiology and formulating scientific and reasonable prevention and control policies. Especially in the post-COVID-19 phase, it is essential to maintain the achievement of the fight against the epidemic. Previous research focuses on flight and railway passenger travel behavior and patterns, but China also has numerous suburban residents with a not-high economic level; investigating their travel behaviors is significant for national stability. However, estimating the impacts of the COVID-19 for suburban residents' travel behaviors remains challenging because of lacking apposite data. Here we submit bus ticketing data including approximately 26,000,000 records from April 2020-August 2020 for 2705 stations. Our results indicate that Suburban residents in Chinese Southern regions are more likely to travel by bus, and travel frequency is higher. Associated with the economic level, we find that residents in the economically developed region more likely to travel or carry out various social activities. Considering from the perspective of the traveling crowd, we find that men and young people are easier to travel by bus; however, they are exactly the main workforce. The indication of our findings is that suburban residents' travel behavior is affected profoundly by economy and consistent with the inherent behavior patterns before the COVID-19 outbreak. We use typical regions as verification and it is indeed the case.	Prevention
34218402	Pharmacists' involvement in COVID-19 vaccination across Europe: a situational analysis of current practice and policy. One year since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid response measures have been implemented internationally to mitigate the spread of the virus. Following rapid and successful pre-clinical and human trials, several vaccines have been authorised for use across Europe through the European Medicines Agency and national regulatory authorities. Clinical trials have shown promising results including important reductions in disease severity, hospitalisation and mortality. In order to maximise the public health benefit of available vaccines, there is a pressing need to vaccinate a large proportion of the population. Internationally, this has prompted coordination of existing services at enormous scale, and development and implementation of novel vaccination strategies to ensure maximum inoculation over the shortest possible timeframe. Pharmacists are being promoted as healthcare professionals that enhance roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination programmes. This paper aims to summarise current policy and practice in relation to pharmacists' involvement in COVID-19 vaccination in 13 countries across Europe.	Prevention
34291525	"Genetic counseling, virtual visits, and equity in the era of COVID-19 and beyond. Overnight, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth rapidly transitioned from limited application to widespread implementation. The field of genetic counseling was well positioned to make this transition to virtual care since there is generally less of a need for patients to be seen in-person for physical exams or urgent care. Going forward, virtual visits will presumably become a mainstay in the provision of genetic services and it is anticipated that clinics will adopt ""hybrid"" models with both in-person and virtual visit options. This commentary highlights the successes and challenges in the rapid implementation of virtual visits, focusing on who has benefited versus who has been challenged or left behind. We also discuss genetic testing considerations, including the additional steps required for patients and clinicians when testing is ordered outside of the clinical setting, which can result in delays or a lack of testing altogether. Future research considerations are presented to address the needs among the most vulnerable and help ensure equitable access and benefit."	Prevention
34352474	COVID-19, the first pandemic in the post-genomic era. The scale of the international efforts to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes is unprecedented. Early availability of genomes allowed rapid characterisation of the virus, thus kickstarting many highly successful vaccine development programmes. Worldwide genomic resources have provided a good understanding of the pandemic, supported close monitoring of the emergence of viral genomic diversity and pinpointed those sites to prioritise for functional characterisation. Continued genomic surveillance of global viral populations will be crucial to inform the timing of vaccine updates so as to pre-empt the spread of immune escape lineages. While genome sequencing has provided us with an exceptionally powerful tool to monitor the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, there is room for further improvements in particular in the form of less heterogeneous global surveillance and tools to rapidly identify concerning viral lineages.

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) has been reported after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we systematically included worldwide reported cases on this association. We included 30 case reports (pediatric and adults) and explored epidemiological and clinical evidence. We described time to diagnosis, clinical, imaging, and laboratory features, response to treatment regimens, and differences regarding severity. Also, an original case report was presented. Neurologists must be alert to the occurrence of multifocal neurological symptoms with or without encephalopathy in patients recovered from COVID-19. Timely MRI studies should be performed to establish the diagnosis and to consider early corticosteroid-based treatment.	Case Report
34284101	"COVID-19 and the Future of Clinical Epidemiology. Clinical epidemiology, the ""basic science for clinical medicine""(1), has changed substantially over the last fifty years, moving its focus from clinician driven research and clinical settings to large cohorts and trials, NIH funding, and practice guidelines. The COVID-19 pandemic created major challenges for clinicians who needed to make urgent decisions about the management a new disease and for researchers who needed to understand the clinical syndrome and the questions of greatest importance to the pandemic response. Addressing these challenges reunited clinicians and researchers in collaborative efforts to inform decisions about disease risk, prevention, prognosis and treatment, at least in part because of the shared sense of the need to ration scarce resources, the rapid evolution of understanding of the clinical syndrome, the recognition of widespread uncertainty, and the emphasis on the common good over individual credit. Only time will tell whether the experience during COVID-19 will revive the original practice of clinical epidemiology as ""the application by a physician who provides direct patient care, of epidemiologic and biometric methods to the study of diagnostic and therapeutic process in order to effect an improvement in health.""(2)."

34284634	Improving pandemic mitigation policies across communities through coupled dynamics of risk perception and infection. Capturing the coupled dynamics between individual behavioural decisions that affect disease transmission and the epidemiology of outbreaks is critical to pandemic mitigation strategy. We develop a multiplex network approach to model how adherence to health-protective behaviours that impact COVID-19 spread are shaped by perceived risks and resulting community norms. We focus on three synergistic dynamics governing individual behavioural choices: (i) social construction of concern, (ii) awareness of disease incidence, and (iii) reassurance by lack of disease. We show why policies enacted early or broadly can cause communities to become reassured and therefore unwilling to maintain or adopt actions. Public health policies for which success relies on collective action should therefore exploit the behaviourally receptive phase; the period between the generation of sufficient concern to foster adoption of novel actions and the relaxation of adherence driven by reassurance fostered by avoidance of negative outcomes over time.

34226889	Repurposing proteases: An in-silico analysis of the binding potential of extracellular fungal proteases with selected viral proteins. Proteases have long been the target of many drugs, but their potential as therapeutic agents is a well-known, but under-explored area. Due to the heightened threat from new and emerging infectious agents, it is worthwhile to tap into the vast microbial protease resource to identify potential therapeutics. By docking proteases of the fungus Penicillium janthinellum NCIM 1366 with the proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the enzymes that have the potential to bind with, and thereby degrade viral proteins were identified. In-silico docking analysis revealed that both fungal and commercially available proteases belonging to the A1A, M20A, S10, S8A and T1A families were able to bind the viral spike, envelope, ORF-7a and Nsp2 proteins (binding energy < -50 kJ/mol), thereby opening up the possibility of developing additional therapeutic applications for these enzymes.

34359931	Cytokine Storm Syndrome in SARS-CoV-2 Infections: A Functional Role of Mast Cells. Cytokine storm syndrome is a cascade of escalated immune responses disposing the immune system to exhaustion, which might ultimately result in organ failure and fatal respiratory distress. Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 can result in uncontrolled production of cytokines and eventually the development of cytokine storm syndrome. Mast cells may react to viruses in collaboration with other cells and lung autopsy findings from patients that died from the coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 (COVID-19) showed accumulation of mast cells in the lungs that was thought to be the cause of pulmonary edema, inflammation, and thrombosis. In this review, we present evidence that a cytokine response by mast cells may initiate inappropriate antiviral immune responses and cause the development of cytokine storm syndrome. We also explore the potential of mast cell activators as adjuvants for COVID-19 vaccines and discuss the medications that target the functions of mast cells and could be of value in the treatment of COVID-19. Recognition of the cytokine storm is crucial for proper treatment of patients and preventing the release of mast cell mediators, as impeding the impacts imposed by these mediators could reduce the severity of COVID-19.

34341671	COVID-19 post-mortem findings: how the departed can teach us. We present an asthmatic 39 year old female frontline healthcare worker in contact with COVID-19 patients, who suffered from respiratory problems for a few days, after which she was found dead by her spouse. Post-mortem (PM) examination showed lung consolidation and histological evidence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), in form of hyaline membrane disease, as well as atypical cells, thrombi and fibrin plugs inside pulmonary capillaries. Swab sample testing for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed the infection status. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus which first emerged in Wuhan, China, and PM is contributing immensely to uncovering the pathophysiological mechanism of this disease. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and can lead to a fatal pneumonia characterised histologically by DAD (the most consistent PM finding). This is due to invasion by the virus of type II pneumocytes, which leads to the death of both type I and II pneumocytes and increased capillary permeability. This compromises gas exchange which can lead eventually to cardiorespiratory failure and death.	Case Report
34288966	"Coronary artery calcification on low-dose chest CT is an early predictor of severe progression of COVID-19-A multi-center, multi-vendor study. PURPOSE: Cardiovascular comorbidity anticipates severe progression of COVID-19 and becomes evident by coronary artery calcification (CAC) on low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT). The purpose of this study was to predict a patient's obligation of intensive care treatment by evaluating the coronary calcium burden on the initial diagnostic LDCT. METHODS: Eighty-nine consecutive patients with parallel LDCT and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were included from three centers. The primary endpoint was admission to ICU, tracheal intubation, or death in the 22-day follow-up period. CAC burden was represented by the Agatston score. Multivariate logistic regression was modeled for prediction of the primary endpoint by the independent variables ""Agatston score > 0"", as well as the CT lung involvement score, patient sex, age, clinical predictors of severe COVID-19 progression (history of hypertension, diabetes, prior cardiovascular event, active smoking, or hyperlipidemia), and laboratory parameters (creatinine, C-reactive protein, leucocyte, as well as thrombocyte counts, relative lymphocyte count, d-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase levels). RESULTS: After excluding multicollinearity, ""Agatston score >0"" was an independent regressor within multivariate analysis for prediction of the primary endpoint (p<0.01). Further independent regressors were creatinine (p = 0.02) and leucocyte count (p = 0.04). The Agatston score was significantly higher for COVID-19 cases which completed the primary endpoint (64.2 [interquartile range 1.7-409.4] vs. 0 [interquartile range 0-0]). CONCLUSION: CAC scoring on LDCT might help to predict future obligation of intensive care treatment at the day of patient admission to the hospital."	Diagnosis;Treatment
34290390	Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in 45,965 adults from the general population of the United Kingdom. We report that in a cohort of 45,965 adults, who were receiving either the ChAdOx1 or the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, in those who had no prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, seroconversion rates and quantitative antibody levels after a single dose were lower in older individuals, especially in those aged >60 years. Two vaccine doses achieved high responses across all ages. Antibody levels increased more slowly and to lower levels with a single dose of ChAdOx1 compared with a single dose of BNT162b2, but waned following a single dose of BNT162b2 in older individuals. In descriptive latent class models, we identified four responder subgroups, including a 'low responder' group that more commonly consisted of people aged >75 years, males and individuals with long-term health conditions. Given our findings, we propose that available vaccines should be prioritized for those not previously infected and that second doses should be prioritized for individuals aged >60 years. Further data are needed to better understand the extent to which quantitative antibody responses are associated with vaccine-mediated protection.	Treatment
34377609	A Rare Case of Herpes Zoster in an Adult Patient Recovered From Symptomatic Reinfection of COVID-19. In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, various dermatological conditions have been observed. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus must be ruled out before considering vesicular exanthems linked to COVID-19. The immunological status of the host has an impact on the natural history of herpes zoster (HZ). Age is a major risk factor for most of the cases of HZ. Reactivation of VZV can be triggered by iatrogenic immunosuppression or disease-related immunocompromised state or age-related immunosenescence. Rarely, dermatological symptoms have been reported in recovered COVID-19 patients. We hereby present a rare case of HZ in a recovered patient from symptomatic reinfection of COVID-19.	Case Report

34200766	Estimates and Determinants of SARS-Cov-2 Seroprevalence and Infection Fatality Ratio Using Latent Class Analysis: The Population-Based Tirschenreuth Study in the Hardest-Hit German County in Spring 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality ratios (IFR) remain controversially discussed with implications for political measures. The German county of Tirschenreuth suffered a severe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in spring 2020, with particularly high case fatality ratio (CFR). To estimate seroprevalence, underreported infections, and IFR for the Tirschenreuth population aged >/=14 years in June/July 2020, we conducted a population-based study including home visits for the elderly, and analyzed 4203 participants for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies via three antibody tests. Latent class analysis yielded 8.6% standardized county-wide seroprevalence, a factor of underreported infections of 5.0, and 2.5% overall IFR. Seroprevalence was two-fold higher among medical workers and one third among current smokers with similar proportions of registered infections. While seroprevalence did not show an age-trend, the factor of underreported infections was 12.2 in the young versus 1.7 for >/=85-year-old. Age-specific IFRs were <0.5% below 60 years of age, 1.0% for age 60-69, and 13.2% for age 70+. Senior care homes accounted for 45% of COVID-19-related deaths, reflected by an IFR of 7.5% among individuals aged 70+ and an overall IFR of 1.4% when excluding senior care home residents from our computation. Our data underscore senior care home infections as key determinant of IFR additionally to age, insufficient targeted testing in the young, and the need for further investigations on behavioral or molecular causes of the fewer infections among current smokers.

34281792	Assessment of potential risk factors for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) among health care workers. BACKGROUND: Understanding COVID-19 infection among health workers and the risk factors for adverse outcomes is important not only for characterizing virus transmission patterns and risk factors for infection, but also for preventing the future infection of health workers and other patients and reducing secondary COVID-19 transmission within health care settings. Our aim was to identify risk factors for infection among health care workers to limit adverse events in health care facilities. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 336 HCWs from COVID-19 treatment hospitals took part in the study with varying COVID-19 exposure risk depending on job function and working site. All participants were asked about risk factors for COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Among our participants, 42.6% were medical doctors, 28.6% nurses and 7.4% assistant nurses and 21.4% were others. Forty four percent of participants had work experience 5-10 years. More than half of participants received training in Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) (56.8%) about COVID 19; 91% have hand hygiene facilities and 69% admitted availability of PPE. More than half of participants admitted that they always follow IPC measures. Two thirds of participants (66.7%) had close contact with a patient since admission; 42.3% were present in aerosolizing procedures for patients. Forty two percent of participants had respiratory symptom; the most common was sore throat representing (32.4%). The highest frequency of respiratory symptoms was among of nurses and assistant nurses 51%. Frequency of respiratory symptoms was higher among those who contacted the patient directly or for prolonged period compared to those who do not admitted these contacts. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for COVID-19 represented by those who were smokers, nurses and assistant nurses were more liable to catch COVID-19 than doctors as they contacted the patient directly for prolonged period or his/her body fluids, materials or surfaces around him.

34339730	Abnormality in the NK cell population is prolonged in severe COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: Our understanding of adaptive immune responses in COVID-19 patients is rapidly evolving, but information on the innate immune responses by natural killer (NK) cells is still insufficient. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the phenotypic and functional status of NK cells and their changes during the course of mild and severe COVID-19. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and flow cytometric analysis of NK cells from patients with mild and severe COVID-19 at multiple time points in the course of the disease using cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). RESULTS: In RNA-seq analysis, the NK cells exhibited distinctive features compared to healthy donors, with significant enrichment of pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. Intriguingly, we found that the unconventional CD56(dim)CD16(neg) (uCD56(dim)) NK cell population expanded in cryopreserved PBMCs from COVID-19 patients regardless of disease severity, accompanied by decreased NK cell cytotoxicity. The NK cell population was rapidly normalized alongside the disappearance of uCD56(dim) NK cells and the recovery of NK cell cytotoxicity in mild COVID-19 patients, but this occurred slowly in severe COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The current longitudinal study provides a deep understanding of the NK cell biology in COVID-19.	Mechanism
34292183	Implications of Frailty in COVID-19. As the global coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to cause higher mortality and hospitalization rates among older adults, strategies such as frailty screening have been suggested for resource allocation and clinical management. Frailty is a physiologic condition characterized by a decreased reserve to stressors and is associated with disability, hospitalization, and death. Measuring frailty can be a useful tool to determine the risk and prognosis of COVID-19 patients in the acute setting, and to provide higher quality of care for vulnerable individuals in the outpatient setting. A literature review was conducted to examine current research regarding frailty and COVID-19. Frailty can inform holistic care of COVID-19 patients, and further investigation is needed to elucidate how measuring frailty should guide treatment and prevention of COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34348613	Applications of 2D and 3D-Dynamic Representations of DNA/RNA Sequences for a description of genome sequences of viruses. The aim of the studies is to show that graphical bioinformatics methods are good tools for the description of genome sequences of viruses. A new approach to the identification of unknown virus strains is proposed. METHODS: Biological sequences have been represented graphically through 2D and 3D-Dynamic Representations of DNA/RNA Sequences - theoretical methods for the graphical representation of the sequences developed by us earlier. In these approaches, some ideas of the classical dynamics have been introduced to bioinformatics. The sequences are represented by sets of material points in 2D or 3D spaces. The distribution of the points in space is characteristic of the sequence. The numerical parameters (descriptors) characterizing the sequences correspond to the quantities typical for classical dynamics. RESULTS: Some applications of the theoretical methods have been reviewed briefly. 2D-dynamic graphs representing the complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are shown. CONCLUSION: It is proved that the 3D-Dynamic Representation of DNA/RNA Sequences, coupled with the random forest algorithm, classifies successfully the subtypes of influenza A virus strains.

34213713	Could urinary kidney injury molecule-1 be a good marker in subclinical acute kidney injury in mild to moderate COVID-19 infection? PURPOSE: To evaluate urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (uKIM-1), which is a proximal tubule injury biomarker in subclinical acute kidney injury (AKI) that may occur in COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The study included proteinuric (n = 30) and non-proteinuric (n = 30) patients diagnosed with mild/moderate COVID-19 infection between March and September 2020 and healthy individuals as a control group (n = 20). The uKIM-1, serum creatinine, cystatin C, spot urine protein, creatinine, and albumin levels of the patients were evaluated again after an average of 21 days. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) uKIM-1 level at the time of presentation was 246 (141-347) pg/mL in the proteinuric group, 83 (29-217) pg/mL in the non-proteinuric group, and 55 (21-123) pg/mL in the control group and significantly high in the proteinuric group than the others (p < 0.001). Creatinine and cystatin C were significantly higher in the proteinuric group than in the group without proteinuria, but none of the patients met the KDIGO-AKI criteria. uKIM-1 had a positive correlation with PCR, non-albumin proteinuria, creatinine, cystatin C, CRP, fibrinogen, LDH, and ferritin, and a negative correlation with eGFR and albumin (p < 0.05). In the multivariate regression analysis, non-albumin proteinuria (p = 0.048) and BUN (p = 0.034) were identified as independent factors predicting a high uKIM-1 level. After 21 +/- 4 days, proteinuria regressed to normal levels in 20 (67%) patients in the proteinuric group. In addition, the uKIM-1 level, albuminuria, non-albumin proteinuria, and CRP significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support that the kidney is one of the target organs of the COVID-19 and it may cause proximal tubule injury even in patients that do not present with AKI or critical/severe COVID-19 infection.

34207756	A Multidisciplinary Approach to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). Since December 2019, humanity has faced an important global threat. Many studies have been published on the origin, structure, and mechanism of action of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the treatment of its disease. The priority of scientists all over the world has been to direct their time to research this subject. In this review, we highlight chemical studies and therapeutic approaches to overcome COVID-19 with seven different sections. These sections are the structure and mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, immunotherapy and vaccine, computer-aided drug design, repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19, synthesis of new molecular structures against COVID-19, food safety/security and functional food components, and potential natural products against COVID-19. In this work, we aimed to screen all the newly synthesized compounds, repurposing chemicals covering antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiparasitic, anticancer, antipsychotic, and antihistamine compounds against COVID-19. We also highlight computer-aided approaches to develop an anti-COVID-19 molecule. We explain that some phytochemicals and dietary supplements have been identified as antiviral bioproducts, which have almost been successfully tested against COVID-19. In addition, we present immunotherapy types, targets, immunotherapy and inflammation/mutations of the virus, immune response, and vaccine issues.	Mechanism;Treatment
34369037	Behaviors and Experiences of Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey: A Mixed Methods Study. AIM: To present behaviors and experiences of nurses in Turkey during the current coronavirus pandemic. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic leads to difficulties for most healthcare workers, especially for nurses who mostly accompany patients and are on the front line. METHODS: In the study, a parallel mixed pattern converging quantitative and qualitative research methods was used. RESULTS: The model revealed that 41 years old or older, diabetic, female, single professionals, working in the pandemic department took more personal measures. Five main themes appeared regarding the experiences of the nurses during the pandemic period: (1) Psychological and mental strain; (2) Personal protective equipment; (3) Organizational, physical, and social strains; (4) Change in professional values; (5) Turning the crisis into an opportunity. CONCLUSIONS: Personal measures are associated with the risk status. There is a need to protect nurses with significant measures by providing psycho-social support, meeting their basic needs, and preventing all complications likely to occur due to increasing workload. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: More efforts should be made to ensure good work, fair treatment, no tolerance for discrimination, and equal compensation conditions.	Prevention

Telemedicine rapidly and unexpectedly became the primary vehicle for ambulatory management. As newborn screen (NBS) referrals require varying levels of acuity, whether telemedicine could be used as a safe and effective medium to return these results were unknown. We sent an online survey to metabolism providers internationally to investigate triage differences of abnormal NBS results during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey compared personal practice for the periods of March-June 2019 and March-June 2020. Responses were received from 44 providers practicing in 8 countries. Nearly all (93%) practiced in areas of widespread SARS-COV-2 community transmission during spring 2020. There was a significant expansion of telemedicine use for NBS referrals at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (OR: 12, 95% CI: 3.66-39.3, p < 0.0001). Telehealth primarily replaced in-person ambulatory metabolism visits. The increased frequency of virtual care was similar across NBS analytes. Providers found telehealth for NBS referral equally efficacious to in-person care. Institutional patient surveys showed no difference in satisfaction with provider communication, provider empathy, or appointment logistics. Our survey was limited by unprecedented disruption in healthcare delivery, necessitating further validation of telegenetics for NBS in the post-pandemic era. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate that telemedicine is potentially a viable and practical tool for triaging abnormal NBS results.	Prevention
34352105	Misalignment between COVID-19 hotspots and clinical trial sites. Hundreds of interventional clinical trials have been launched in the United States to identify effective treatment strategies for combating the COVID-19 pandemic. However, to date, only a small fraction of these trials has completed enrollment, delaying the scientific investigation of COVID-19 and its treatment options. This study presents novel metrics to examine the geographic alignment between COVID-19 hotspots and interventional clinical trial sites and evaluate trial access over time during the evolving pandemic. Using temporal COVID-19 case data from USAFacts.org and trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov, US counties were categorized based on their numbers of cases and trials. Our analysis suggests that alignment and access have worsened as the pandemic shifted over time. We recommend strategies and metrics to evaluate the alignment between cases and trials. Future studies are warranted to investigate the impact of the misalignment of cases and clinical trial sites on clinical trial recruitment.	Prevention
34218413	Arterial and venous thrombosis in coronavirus 2019 disease (Covid-19): relationship with mortality. BACKGROUND: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may experience venous thrombosis while data regarding arterial thrombosis are sparse. METHODS: Prospective multicenter study in 5 hospitals including 373 patients with Covid-19-related pneumonia. Demographic data, laboratory findings including coagulation tests and comorbidities were reported. During the follow-up any arterial or venous thrombotic events and death were registered. RESULTS: Among 373 patients, 75 (20%) had a thrombotic event and 75 (20%) died. Thrombotic events included 41 venous thromboembolism and 34 arterial thrombosis. Age, cardiovascular disease, intensive care unit treatment, white blood cells, D-dimer, albumin and troponin blood levels were associated with thrombotic events. In a multivariable regression logistic model, intensive care unit treatment (Odds Ratio [OR]: 6.0; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.8-12.6; p < 0.001); coronary artery disease (OR: 2.4; 95% CI 1.4-5.0; p = 0.022); and albumin levels (OR: 0.49; 95% CI 0.28-0.87; p = 0.014) were associated with ischemic events. Age, sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, heart failure, coronary heart disease, intensive care unit treatment, in-hospital thrombotic events, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, troponin, and albumin levels were associated with mortality. A multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that in-hospital thrombotic events (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.72; 95% CI 1.59-4.65; p < 0.001), age (HR: 1.035; 95% CI 1.014-1.057; p = 0.001), and albumin (HR: 0.447; 95% CI 0.277-0.723; p = 0.001) predicted morality. CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 patients experience an equipollent rate of venous and arterial thrombotic events, that are associated with poor survival. Early identification and appropriate treatment of Covid-19 patients at risk of thrombosis may improve prognosis.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34284812	Severe reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in a nursing home resident: a case report. BACKGROUND: The topic of natural immunity related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 remains controversial. Although evidence suggests postinfection immunity can be achieved, there have been reported cases of reinfection with similar or milder symptoms. Information on severe disease manifestation during reinfection is not known. We present a case of reinfection with a more severe presentation as compared with the initial infection. CASE REPORT: We describe a white male patient from a nursing home who was reinfected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with severe disease manifesting as dyspnea, fevers, and encephalopathy with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation, elevated inflammatory markers, and lung infiltrates on imaging, after initially testing positive with mild symptoms 2 months prior to presentation. Notably, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies were detected, which indicated this was a coronavirus disease 2019 reinfection. After treatment with remdesivir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma, he was subsequently extubated and discharged home after 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: It is not clear whether an initial infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and recovery provides prolonged immunity beyond 2 months. Furthermore, even if antibodies are present, it does not guarantee an attenuated course during reinfection. Therefore, vaccination plays an important role in prevention. Long-term cohort studies will be needed to study the factors behind reinfection.	Case Report
34222654	Impact of COVID-19 on Pharmaceutical Care Services and the Role of Community Pharmacists: A Multi-Center Cross-Sectional Study in Ethiopia. Objectives: The current study aimed at assessing the impact of COVID-19 on pharmaceutical care services and the role of community pharmacists. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1st to June 7, 2020, on community pharmacies in Bahir Dar and Gondar cities, Ethiopia. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were conducted. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered to declare statistical significance at a 95% Confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 101 community pharmacies were approached (one pharmacist per pharmacy), and 80 of them had completed the survey. From the total pharmacies, 78.8% of them had encountered a shortage of pharmaceutical products. Chi-square test revealed that there was a significant difference (P = 0.036) in the shortage of personal protection equipment between Gondar and Bahir Dar cities. Face mask 55 (77.4%) followed by hand glove 15 (21.1%) were the most commonly reported personal protective equipment's in short supply. Conclusion: Strategies should be in place to improve the availability and affordability of various essential pharmaceuticals to mitigate the spread of the disease and prevent other complications.

34203880	"Dexamethasone in the Treatment of COVID-19: Primus Inter Pares? Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread globally, becoming a huge public health challenge. Even though the vast majority of patients are asymptomatic, some patients present with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and death. It has been shown in several studies that the severity and clinical outcomes are related to dysregulated antiviral immunity and enhanced and persistent systemic inflammation. Corticosteroids have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, as they are reported to elicit benefits by reducing lung inflammation and inflammation-induced lung injury. Dexamethasone has gained a major role in the therapeutic algorithm of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen or on mechanical ventilation. Its wide anti-inflammatory action seems to form the basis for its beneficial action, taming the overwhelming ""cytokine storm"". Amid a plethora of scientific research on therapeutic options for COVID-19, there are still unanswered questions about the right timing, right dosing, and right duration of the corticosteroid treatment. The aim of this review article was to summarize the data on the dexamethasone treatment in COVID-19 and outline the clinical considerations of corticosteroid therapy in these patients."	Treatment
34218279	The Covid-19 pandemic and its concomitant benefits: improved hygiene habits. In an editorial, the editor has explored how state response to the pandemic has collateral damages not only in the public health in general but also in economy and education. Ironically, it also shows that the adjustments and adaptations in peoples' behavior have resulted in improved habits in personal hygiene and self-care. Not all is bad though as people have (re)learned the basic value of handwashing and preventive measures to avoid any diseases and spread of germs. In the long run, this is going to be beneficial to prevent any repeat of the pandemic of this magnitude.	Prevention
34217220	Pre-existing cardiovascular disease rather than cardiovascular risk factors drives mortality in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The relative association between cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, established CV disease (CVD), and susceptibility to CV complications or mortality in COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of consecutive adults hospitalised for severe COVID-19 between 1st March and 30th June 2020. Pre-existing CVD, CV risk factors and associations with mortality and CV complications were ascertained. RESULTS: Among 1721 patients (median age 71 years, 57% male), 349 (20.3%) had pre-existing CVD (CVD), 888 (51.6%) had CV risk factors without CVD (RF-CVD), 484 (28.1%) had neither. Patients with CVD were older with a higher burden of non-CV comorbidities. During follow-up, 438 (25.5%) patients died: 37% with CVD, 25.7% with RF-CVD and 16.5% with neither. CVD was independently associated with in-hospital mortality among patients < 70 years of age (adjusted HR 2.43 [95% CI 1.16-5.07]), but not in those >/= 70 years (aHR 1.14 [95% CI 0.77-1.69]). RF-CVD were not independently associated with mortality in either age group (< 70 y aHR 1.21 [95% CI 0.72-2.01], >/= 70 y aHR 1.07 [95% CI 0.76-1.52]). Most CV complications occurred in patients with CVD (66%) versus RF-CVD (17%) or neither (11%; p < 0.001). 213 [12.4%] patients developed venous thromboembolism (VTE). CVD was not an independent predictor of VTE. CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, pre-existing established CVD appears to be a more important contributor to mortality than CV risk factors in the absence of CVD. CVD-related hazard may be mediated, in part, by new CV complications. Optimal care and vigilance for destabilised CVD are essential in this patient group. Trial registration n/a.	Diagnosis;Treatment

34291074	Nutritional Impact and Its Potential Consequences on COVID-19 Severity. Background: During late 2019 a viral disease due to a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China, which rapidly developed into an exploding pandemic and poses a severe threat to human health all over the world. Until now (May 2021), there are insufficient treatment options for the management of this global disease and shortage of vaccines. Important aspects that help to defeat coronavirus infection seems to be having a healthy, strong, and resilient immune system. Nutrition and metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes play a crucial role on the community health situation in general and especially during this new pandemic. There seems to be an enormous impact of lifestyle, metabolic disorders, and immune status on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and recovery. For this reason, it is important to consider the impact of lifestyle and the consumption of well-defined healthy diets during the pandemic. Aims: In this review, we summarise recent findings on the effect of nutrition on COVID-19 susceptibility and disease severity and treatment. Understanding how specific dietary features might help to improve the public health strategies to reduce the rate and severity of COVID-19.	Treatment
34226876	Safety practices for in-office laryngology procedures during clinical reintroduction amidst COVID-19. Objective: Describe safety practices for performing in-office laryngology procedures during clinical re-introduction amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: An anonymous survey in Qualtrics was created to evaluate demographics, preprocedure testing, practice settings, anesthesia, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use for five procedure categories (non-mucosal-traversing injections, mucosal-traversing injections, endoscopy without suction, endoscopy with suction/mucosal intervention via working channel, and laser via working channel). The survey was emailed to the Fall Voice Community on Doc Matter and to members of the American Broncho-Esophagological Association (ABEA) from May to June 2020. Results: Eighty-two respondents were analyzed (response rate: 10%). Respondents represented diverse locations, including international. Most reported academic (71%) or private practices (16%), laryngology fellowship training (76%), and a significant practice devotion to laryngology and broncho-esophagology. During the early re-introduction, most continued to perform all procedure categories. The office was preferred to the OR setting for most, though 36% preferred the OR for laser procedures. There was a preference for preprocedural SARS-Cov2 testing for procedures involving a working channel (>67%), and these procedures had the highest proportion of respondents discontinuing the procedure due to COVID-19. Various types of topical anesthesia were reported, including nebulizer treatments. The most common forms of personal protective equipment utilized were gloves (>95%) and N95 masks (>67%). Powered-air purifying respirators and general surgical masks were used infrequently. Conclusions: During the early re-introduction, respondents reported generally continuing to perform office laryngology procedures, while greater mucosal manipulation affected decisions to stop procedures due to COVID-19, perform preprocedural SARS-Cov2 testing, and alter topical anesthesia. Gloves and N95 masks were the predominate PPE. Level of Evidence: N/A.	Prevention
34347869	"Online Media Attention Devoted to Flour and Flour-Related Food Safety in 2017 - 2020. In light of extended stay-at-home periods during the COVID-19 pandemic, recent societal trends have revealed an increased use of online media to remain connected. Simultaneously, interests in at-home cooking and baking, particularly of 'comfort foods' have increased. Since flour is a crucial component in many of these products, we analyze how the U.S. public, in social and online media space, references ""flour"" and its use. We also quantify the share of media mentions about flour that are devoted to flour-related food safety risks and/or risk mitigation. It was found that the volume of mentions about flour and its use fluctuate seasonally, often increasing ahead of the winter holiday season (November-December time period). Further, the volume of interest rapidly increased in March 2020 when stay-at-home orders were issued. The share of media devoted to flour-related food safety risks or associated illness were extremely small but generally corresponded with flour recall announcements or other public risk communications. Overall, the interest in flour and its use remains seasonal and predictably related to societal trends, such as increased baking at home during the holidays or 2020 stay-at-home orders. However, awareness of flour-related food safety risks seems largely absent based on online media data collection and analysis, except in immediate reactions to flour recalls. This study suggests that more flour safety education program may be desired to support consumers' informed decision-making."	Prevention
34287905	Correlations Between Olfactory Psychophysical Scores and SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load in COVID-19 Patients. OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between the severity and duration of olfactory dysfunctions (OD), assessed with psychophysical tests, and the viral load on the rhino-pharyngeal swab determined with a direct method, in patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Patients underwent psychophysical olfactory assessment with Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center test and determination of the normalized viral load on nasopharyngeal swab within 10 days of the clinical onset of COVID-19. RESULTS: Sixty COVID-19 patients were included in this study. On psychophysical testing, 12 patients (20% of the cohort) presented with anosmia, 11 (18.3%) severe hyposmia, 13 (18.3%) moderate hyposmia, and 10 (16.7%) mild hyposmia with an overall prevalence of OD of 76.7%. The overall median olfactory score was 50 (interquartile range [IQR] 30-72.5) with no significant differences between clinical severity subgroups. The median normalized viral load detected in the series was 2.56E+06 viral copies/10(6) copies of human beta-2microglobulin mRNA present in the sample (IQR 3.17E+04-1.58E+07) without any significant correlations with COVID-19 severity. The correlation between viral load and olfactory scores at baseline (R(2) = 0.0007; P = .844) and 60-day follow-up (R(2) = 0.0077; P = .519) was weak and not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of OD does not seem to be useful in identifying subjects at risk for being super-spreaders or who is at risk of developing long-term OD. Similarly, the pathogenesis of OD is probably related to individual factors rather than to viral load and activity. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 2021.	Diagnosis
34221756	Safety Precautions for Self-Performed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Tests: A Case of a Swallowed Swab. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens collected by swabbing are the pillars of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostics. Commercially available rapid antigen tests and self-sampling polymerase chain reaction services have made specimen collection available anytime and anywhere in nonmedical settings. In this study, we report the case of a 45-year-old man who accidentally ingested a swab during self-performed SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen testing. Imaging studies revealed an elongated foreign body in the stomach. Urgent gastroscopy confirmed the presence of the swabbing applicator in the gastric lumen, which was retrieved using a loop without any complications. Millions of SARS-CoV-2 tests are performed daily, of which an increasing proportion are performed by laypeople. Foreign bodies account for a particular set of complications, which can be avoided by cautious sampling and using the correct technique. Radiopaque labeling of instruments would be useful. Otherwise, rare serious events can occur that may require immediate medical interventions.	Case Report
34209659	Potential In Vitro Inhibition of Selected Plant Extracts against SARS-CoV-2 Chymotripsin-Like Protease (3CL(Pro)) Activity. Antiviral treatments inhibiting Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication may represent a strategy complementary to vaccination to fight the ongoing Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Molecules or extracts inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 chymotripsin-like protease (3CL(Pro)) could contribute to reducing or suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Using a targeted approach, we identified 17 plant products that are included in current and traditional cuisines as promising inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(Pro) activity. Methanolic extracts were evaluated in vitro for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(Pro) activity using a quenched fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. Extracts from turmeric (Curcuma longa) rhizomes, mustard (Brassica nigra) seeds, and wall rocket (Diplotaxis erucoides subsp. erucoides) at 500 microg mL(-1) displayed significant inhibition of the 3CL(Pro) activity, resulting in residual protease activities of 0.0%, 9.4%, and 14.9%, respectively. Using different extract concentrations, an IC50 value of 15.74 microg mL(-1) was calculated for turmeric extract. Commercial curcumin inhibited the 3CL(Pro) activity, but did not fully account for the inhibitory effect of turmeric rhizomes extracts, suggesting that other components of the turmeric extract must also play a main role in inhibiting the 3CL(Pro) activity. Sinigrin, a major glucosinolate present in mustard seeds and wall rocket, did not have relevant 3CL(Pro) inhibitory activity; however, its hydrolysis product allyl isothiocyanate had an IC50 value of 41.43 microg mL(-1). The current study identifies plant extracts and molecules that can be of interest in the search for treatments against COVID-19, acting as a basis for future chemical, in vivo, and clinical trials.

34210653	Impact of the pandemic on surgical activity in colorectal cancer in Spain. Results of a national survey. INTRODUCTION: The pandemic has had an impact on colorectal cancer surgery in hospitals. In 2020, up to 75% of colorectal cancer patients are estimated to require surgery. No objective data on the impact of the pandemic on the management of surgical waiting lists is available. We conducted a survey in colorectal surgery units to assess the impact on colorectal cancer surgery waiting lists. METHOD: All personnel in charge of colorectal surgery units nationwide received a survey (from February to April, 2020) with eight questions divided into three sections-cessation date of colorectal cancer surgeries, number of patients waiting for treatment, and use of neoadjuvant therapy to postpone surgery. RESULTS: Sixty-seven units participated in the study, with 79.1% of units ceasing some type of activity (32.8% total and 46.3% partial cessation) and 20.9% continuing all surgical activity. In addition, 65% of units used or prolonged neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer patients and 40% of units performed at least five emergency colorectal cancer surgeries. It was estimated that at least one month of intense surgical activity will be required to catch up. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, patients from units with a long waiting list must be redistributed, at least within the country. In the future, in the event of a second wave of the pandemic, an effective program to manage each unit's resources should be developed to prevent total collapse.	Prevention
34292136	Isolated and anxious: A qualitative exploration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals living with spinal cord injury in the UK. Objective: People living with spinal cord injury (SCI) are often immunocompromised, and at increased risk of respiratory infection. Given the restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, those with SCI may be at increased risk of health deterioration, though how this is experienced is poorly understood. This study explored the experiences of people living with SCI during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design: Participants completed an online survey consisting of demographic questions, and open-ended qualitative questions pertaining to their experiences during the pandemic. Thematic analysis was utilized for the analytical approach.Setting: Community-based sample in the UK.Participants: Participants were recruited via social media outlets of UK-based SCI-specific support charities, and snowball sampling (N = 42, F = 34, M = 8).Results: Key themes included: (1) lost access to health services and support, capturing concerns surrounding barriers to healthcare and rehabilitation, which intensified secondary consequences of SCI such as spasm and pain; (2) health anxiety, which was perpetuated by perceived heightened vulnerabilities to respiratory complications; (3) social isolation, with significantly reduced social contact, even with care providers, compounding health experiences.Conclusion: People living with SCI during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced a variety of personal physical, psychological, and social challenges, each of which could disrupt daily functioning and quality of life. Increased utilization of telehealth is recommended to support continued engagement in rehabilitation, and foster connection and community amongst others with SCI and health professionals.	Prevention
34227728	'They're getting a taste of our world': A qualitative study of people with multiple sclerosis' experiences of accessing health care during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Australian Capital Territory. BACKGROUND: People with multiple sclerosis (MS), who are often immunocompromised, require complex care and engage with a variety of health-care providers to manage their health. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate people with MS' experiences of accessing health care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. DESIGN: A qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Eight adults with a clinical diagnosis of MS participated in telephone or video call interviews between June and July 2020. RESULTS: Participants were aware that having MS made them more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19. In some cases, usual care was postponed or not sought. Some circumstances warranted the risk of a face-to-face consultation. Benefits of telehealth consultations included improved access, convenience and being contact-free. In comparison with video consultations, those via telephone were considered less personal and limited capacity to read body language, and for physical examination. Most participants hoped to incorporate telehealth into their future health-care routines. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Personal risk assessment and trust in health-care professionals are determinants of the mode through which people with MS accessed health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth has been a valuable tool to mitigate COVID-19 transmission through enabling contact-free consultations. People with MS may find specific value in video consultations, which enable visualization of physical function. There is a need for training and support for all clinicians to conduct remote consultations. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This study was conducted by a team comprised of four people with MS, a neurologist and four health services researchers.	Prevention
34202591	Pattern of Visits in a Metropolitan Emergency Department in Lombardia (Italy): January 2019-December 2020. During the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a general decrease in the presentations to emergency departments (ED) was reported. However, we suspect that there was a lower number but an unchanged pattern of ED visits for urgent conditions in 2020 compared to 2019. This retrospective study assessed the change in the number of presentations in the ED of a tertiary level university hospital in Milano (Lombardia, Italy). Compared to 2019, a significant drop in ED presentations occurred (-46.4%), and we recorded a -15.7% difference in the proportion of patients admitted with white codes. The pattern of hourly presentations to the ED was unchanged, with overcrowding during the working daytime. COVID-19 changed ED flows, likely causing an overall reduction in the number of deferrable conditions. However, the pattern associated with urgent conditions did not change abruptly in 2020.

34281489	Leucoefdin a potential inhibitor against SARS CoV-2 M(pro). Leucoefdin an important constituent of various fruits such as banana, raspberry, etc. was explored to target M(Pro) protease of SARS Co-V 2. Ligand was found to bind at active site of M(Pro) with large negative binding energies in molecular docking and simulation study. The docking results showed that Leucoefdin interacted with the M(Pro) by forming hydrogen bonds, at Leu 141, His163, His 164, and Glu 166. Other non-bonded interactions were seen at Met49, Pro52, Tyr54, Phe140, Leu141, Cys145 and Met165. Results of Leucoefdin was in coherence with the recently reported M(Pro) protease-inhibitor complex. It even displayed better binding energies (kcal/mol) in HTVS (-6.28), SP (-7.28), XP (-9.29) and MMGBSA (-44.71) as compared to the reference ligand [HTVS (-4.87), SP (-6.79), XP (-5.75) and MMGBSA (-47.76)]. Leucoefdin-M(Pro) complex on molecular dynamic simulation showed initial fluctuations in RMSD plot for a certain period and attained equilibrium which remained stable during entire simulation for 150 ns. RMSF of protein showed less secondary structure fluctuations and a greater number of H-bond formation with Leucoefdin during 150 ns simulation. Post simulation MMGBSA analysis showed binding energy of -45.98 Kcal/mol. These findings indicated the potential of Leucoefdin as lead compound in R&D for drug discovery and development against SARS CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.	Mechanism;Treatment
34289178	Growth assessment of children during the COVID-19 pandemic-Can we rely on parental measurements? AIM: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the rapid development of remote medical services. During lockdown periods, children's growth data were obtained from parents' home assessments. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of home height and weight measurements and analyse their utility in clinical decision-making. METHODS: A retrospective, single-centre observational study. Children aged 3-18 years were measured for weight and height at home using guidance provided to parents on proper measurements techniques before subsequent professional re-evaluation at our endocrine institution clinic. The two sets of measurements were compared and analysed according to various clinical parameters. RESULTS: Height measurements at home and in the clinic were comparable (diff = 0.1 +/- 1.3cm, p = 0.42) amongst the 107 children (mean age 10.2 +/- 3.7, 56.1% males) participating in the study, except in overweight and obese children where they were significantly higher in the clinic (diff = 0.86 +/- 1.48cm, p = 0.018). Weight and BMI were significantly higher in the clinic (diff = 0.45 +/- 0.8kg and diff = 0.3 +/- 0.6kg/m(2) , p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Height measurements of children by their parents were accurate except in obese and overweight children, whereas weight measurements tended to be lower than in the clinic. With proper guidance, parents' home measurements of height and weight are accurate and suitable for clinical decision-making.	Prevention
34213362	High excess deaths in Sweden during the first wave of COVID-19: Policy deficiencies or 'dry tinder'? AIMS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Sweden registered a high level of excess deaths. Non-pharmaceutical interventions adopted by Sweden have been milder compared to those implemented in Denmark. Moreover, Sweden might have started the pandemic with a large proportion of vulnerable elderly with a high mortality risk. This study aimed to clarify whether excess mortality in Sweden can be explained by a large stock of 'dry tinder' instead of being attributed to faulty lockdown policies. METHODS: We analysed weekly death counts in Sweden and Denmark from July 2007 to June 2020. We used a novel method for short-term mortality forecasting to estimate expected and excess deaths during the first COVID-19 wave in Sweden and Denmark. RESULTS: In the first part of the epiyear 2019-2020, deaths were low in both Sweden and Denmark. In the absence of COVID-19, a relatively low level of death would be expected for the later part of the epiyear. The registered deaths were, however, way above the upper bound of the prediction interval in Sweden and within the range in Denmark. CONCLUSIONS: 'Dry tinder' can only account for a modest fraction of excess Swedish mortality. The risk of death during the first COVID-19 wave rose significantly for Swedish women aged >85 but only slightly for Danish women aged >85. The risk discrepancy seems more likely to result from differences between Sweden and Denmark in how care and housing for the elderly are organised, coupled with a less successful Swedish strategy of shielding the elderly.

34206727	Case Study of Two Post Vaccination SARS-CoV-2 Infections with P1 Variants in CoronaVac Vaccinees in Brazil. The rapid development of efficacious and safe vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been instrumental in mitigating the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Moreover, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants raised concerns on the efficacy of these vaccines. Herein, we report two cases of breakthrough infections with the P1 variant in patients vaccinated with CoronaVac, which is one of the two vaccines authorized for emergency use in the Brazilian immunization program. Our observations suggest that the vaccine reduced the severity of the disease and highlight the potential risk of illness following vaccination and subsequent infection with the P1 variant as well as for continued efforts to prevent and diagnose infection in vaccinated persons.

Background: Anosmia and hyposmia have many etiologies, including trauma, chronic sinusitis, neoplasms, and respiratory viral infections such as rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to systematically review the literature on the diagnostic evaluation of anosmia/hyposmia. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for articles published since January 1990 using terms combined with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). We included articles evaluating diagnostic modalities for anosmia, written in the English language, used original data, and had two or more patients. Results: A total of 2065 unique titles were returned upon the initial search. Of these, 226 abstracts were examined, yielding 27 full-text articles meeting inclusion criteria (Level of evidence ranging from 1 to 4; most level 2). The studies included a total of 13,577 patients. The most utilized diagnostic tools were orthonasal smell tests (such as the Sniffin' Sticks and the UPSIT, along with validated abridged smell tests). Though various imaging modalities (including MRI and CT) were frequently mentioned in the workup of olfactory dysfunction, routine imaging was not used to primarily diagnose smell loss. Conclusion: The literature includes several studies on validity and reliability for various smell tests in diagnosing anosmia. Along with a thorough history and physical, validated orthonasal smell tests should be part of the workup of the patient with suspected olfactory dysfunction. The most widely studied modality was MRI, but criteria for the timing and sequence of imaging modalities was heterogenous.	Diagnosis
34220185	Integration of human factors/ergonomics in healthcare systems: A giant leap in safety as a key strategy during Covid-19. In this article, we present a model for integrating Human Factors/Ergonomics (HFE) into healthcare systems to make them more robust and resilient. We believe that to increase the impact of HFE during and after the Covid-19 pandemic this integration should be carried out simultaneously at all levels (micro, meso, and macro) of the healthcare system. This new model recognizes the interrelationship between HFE and other system characteristics such as capacity, coverage, robustness, integrity, and resilience. We hope that the model will serve as a reference for a giant leap to design and improve the safety and effectiveness of healthcare services from a holistic (systems) perspective.	Prevention
34133825	Myopericarditis in a previously healthy adolescent male following COVID-19 vaccination: A case report. We report the case of a previously healthy 16-year-old male who developed myopericarditis following the second dose of his Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, with no other identified triggers. Adolescents and young adults experiencing chest pain after COVD-19 vaccination should seek emergent medical care, and emergency providers should have a low threshold to consider and evaluate for myopericarditis. More data are needed to better understand the potential association between COVID-19 vaccines and myopericarditis. If a true causal link is identified, the risk must also be viewed in context with the millions of patients who have been safely vaccinated and the known morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection. As we see widespread vaccine rollout, it is important that all potential adverse reactions are reported as we continue to monitor for more rare but potentially serious side effects not identified in vaccination trials.

34349563	Delayed Breast Cancer Detection in an Asian Country (Taiwan) with Low COVID-19 Incidence. Purpose: To assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic delayed breast cancer diagnosis in Taiwan, an Asian country with a low COVID-19 incidence. Methods: The monthly volume of breast biopsies and breast cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic (during January 21 and July 31, 2020) was compared to the same period in 2019 (pre-COVID-19). Results: Taiwan recorded a lower COVID-19 incidence rate (20.2 cases per million population) than other Asian countries. The screen-detected lesions accounted for 55% and 36% of 2019 and 2020 total biopsied lesions, respectively. Total breast biopsy, mammography-guided, and ultrasound-guided biopsies decreased by 17%, 23%, and 14%, respectively, from pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19. Monthly differences were significant in total biopsy (p=0.03), mammography-guided biopsy (p=0.04), and a benign pathology result after breast biopsy (p<0.01). Nearly 46% decline was noted in the biopsy results of non-invasive breast cancer in 2020. The number of total breast cancers and early breast cancers (stages 0 and 1) decreased by 10% and 38%, respectively, during pandemic. Individuals with early breast cancer accounted for 71% and 49% of the total diagnosed breast cancer in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion: The pandemic significantly delayed early breast cancer detection in Taiwan despite low COVID-19 incidence. Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04750018.	Prevention
34287009	Amplicon and Metagenomic Analysis of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus and the Microbiome in Patients with Severe MERS. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic infection that emerged in the Middle East in 2012. Symptoms range from mild to severe and include both respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses. The virus is mainly present in camel populations with occasional zoonotic spill over into humans. The severity of infection in humans is influenced by numerous factors, and similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underlying health complications can play a major role. Currently, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are coincident in the Middle East and thus a rapid way of sequencing MERS-CoV to derive genotype information for molecular epidemiology is needed. Additionally, complicating factors in MERS-CoV infections are coinfections that require clinical management. The ability to rapidly characterize these infections would be advantageous. To rapidly sequence MERS-CoV, an amplicon-based approach was developed and coupled to Oxford Nanopore long read length sequencing. This and a metagenomic approach were evaluated with clinical samples from patients with MERS. The data illustrated that whole-genome or near-whole-genome information on MERS-CoV could be rapidly obtained. This approach provided data on both consensus genomes and the presence of minor variants, including deletion mutants. The metagenomic analysis provided information of the background microbiome. The advantage of this approach is that insertions and deletions can be identified, which are the major drivers of genotype change in coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in late 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The virus is a serious threat to people not only in the Middle East but also in the world and has been detected in over 27 countries. MERS-CoV is spreading in the Middle East and neighboring countries, and approximately 35% of reported patients with this virus have died. This is the most severe coronavirus infection so far described. Saudi Arabia is a destination for many millions of people in the world who visit for religious purposes (Umrah and Hajj), and so it is a very vulnerable area, which imposes unique challenges for effective control of this epidemic. The significance of our study is that clinical samples from patients with MERS were used for rapid in-depth sequencing and metagenomic analysis using long read length sequencing.	Mechanism
34210567	The COVID-19 pandemic and opioid use disorder: Expanding treatment with buprenorphine, and combining safety precautions with telehealth. BACKGROUND: This study investigated the efficacy and safety of providing medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and individualized telehealth in Kentucky, a state severely impacted simultaneously by the opioid epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The investigation analyzed pre- and post-COVID-19 characteristics in 191 opioid use disorder (OUD) buprenorphine outpatients who completed an 18-question survey in late 2020 related to COVID testing, OUD relapses, obstacles to maintaining abstinence, and treatment resources. RESULTS: The study revealed no statistically significant changes in drug use before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic despite monthly volume increases. Results further demonstrated statistically significant barriers to treatment, including loss of housing and transportation, food insecurity, and onset of depression. No patients required hospitalization or succumbed to OUD or COVID-19. Potentially effective resource utilization findings included clinic transportation and 24/7 crisis intervention. Respondents rated telehealth as helpful when used in an individualized hybrid model matching patient's need to available resources based on COVID-19 safety guidelines. CONCLUSION: This report yields key clinical insights into providing outpatient MOUD care during the COVID-19 pandemic, validating in-person care as both safe and effective. Patients' experiences proved helpful in identifying and quantifying obstacles to abstinence in conjunction with facilitating continued patient access to essential clinical resources. Notably, telehealth can supplement rather than replace in-person treatment.	Prevention
34292414	Emergency teleradiological activity is an epidemiological estimator and predictor of the covid-19 pandemic in mainland France. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for real-time monitoring of diseases evolution to rapidly adapt restrictive measures. This prospective multicentric study aimed at investigating radiological markers of COVID-19-related emergency activity as global estimators of pandemic evolution in France. We incorporated two sources of data from March to November 2020: an open-source epidemiological dataset, collecting daily hospitalisations, intensive care unit admissions, hospital deaths and discharges, and a teleradiology dataset corresponding to the weekly number of CT-scans performed in 65 emergency centres and interpreted remotely. CT-scans specifically requested for COVID-19 suspicion were monitored. Teleradiological and epidemiological time series were aligned. Their relationships were estimated through a cross-correlation function, and their extremes and breakpoints were compared. Dynamic linear models were trained to forecast the weekly hospitalisations based on teleradiological activity predictors. RESULTS: A total of 100,018 CT-scans were included over 36 weeks, and 19,133 (19%) performed within the COVID-19 workflow. Concomitantly, 227,677 hospitalisations were reported. Teleradiological and epidemiological time series were almost perfectly superimposed (cross-correlation coefficients at lag 0: 0.90-0.92). Maximal number of COVID-19 CT-scans was reached the week of 2020-03-23 (1 086 CT-scans), 1 week before the highest hospitalisations (23,542 patients). The best valid forecasting model combined the number of COVID-19 CT-scans and the number of hospitalisations during the prior two weeks and provided the lowest mean absolute percentage (5.09%, testing period: 2020-11-02 to 2020-11-29). CONCLUSION: Monitoring COVID-19 CT-scan activity in emergencies accurately and instantly predicts hospitalisations and helps adjust medical resources, paving the way for complementary public health indicators.

34333308	Compliance with hand sanitizer quality during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Assessing the impurities in an ethanol plant. Using alcohol-based disinfectants is an effective method for preventing the spread of COVID-19. However, non-traditional manufacturers of alcohol-based disinfectants, such as ethanol plants, need to undergo additional treatment to curb their impurities to limits set by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) to produce alcohol-based disinfectants. To transform them to disinfectant-grade alcohol, 17 process streams in a dry-mill ethanol plant were analyzed to determine the quality parameters for acetaldehyde, acetal, propanol, methanol, and water, including chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, and nutrients. Results suggest that the process stream generated by the distillation column requires further treatment because the acetaldehyde and acetal concentrations are significantly higher than the impurity limit set by the FDA. The addition of a second distillation column could be a potential method for addressing impurities and it will have minimal influence on hazardous air pollutant generation and water use.	Prevention
34338591	Evolving ribonucleocapsid assembly/packaging signals in the genomes of the human and animal coronaviruses: targeting, transmission and evolution. A world-wide COVID-19 pandemic intensified strongly the studies of molecular mechanisms related to the coronaviruses. The origin of coronaviruses and the risks of human-to-human, animal-to-human and human-to-animal transmission of coronaviral infections can be understood only on a broader evolutionary level by detailed comparative studies. In this paper, we studied ribonucleocapsid assembly-packaging signals (RNAPS) in the genomes of all seven known pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 and compared them with RNAPS in the genomes of the related animal coronaviruses including SARS-Bat-CoV, MERS-Camel-CoV, MHV, Bat-CoV MOP1, TGEV and one of camel alphacoronaviruses. RNAPS in the genomes of coronaviruses were evolved due to weakly specific interactions between genomic RNA and N proteins in helical nucleocapsids. Combining transitional genome mapping and Jaccard correlation coefficients allows us to perform the analysis directly in terms of underlying motifs distributed over the genome. In all coronaviruses, RNAPS were distributed quasi-periodically over the genome with the period about 54 nt biased to 57 nt and to 51 nt for the genomes longer and shorter than that of SARS-CoV, respectively. The comparison with the experimentally verified packaging signals for MERS-CoV, MHV and TGEV proved that the distribution of particular motifs is strongly correlated with the packaging signals. We also found that many motifs were highly conserved in both characters and positioning on the genomes throughout the lineages that make them promising therapeutic targets. The mechanisms of encapsidation can affect the recombination and co-infection as well.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.	Mechanism;Transmission
34224675	BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine and correlates of humoral immune responses and dynamics: a prospective, single-centre, longitudinal cohort study in health-care workers. BACKGROUND: Concurrent with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine roll-out in Israel initiated on Dec 19, 2020, we assessed the early antibody responses and antibody kinetics after each vaccine dose in health-care workers of different ages and sexes, and with different comorbidities. METHODS: We did a prospective, single-centre, longitudinal cohort study at the Sheba Medical Centre (Tel-Hashomer, Israel). Eligible participants were health-care workers at the centre who had a negative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay before receiving the first dose of the intramuscular vaccine, and at least one serological antibody test after the first dose of the vaccine. Health-care workers with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test before vaccination, a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology test before vaccination, or infection with COVID-19 after vaccination were excluded from the study. Participants were followed up weekly for 5 weeks after the first vaccine dose; a second dose was given at week 3. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and at each weekly follow-up, and antibodies were tested at 1-2 weeks after the first vaccine dose, at week 3 with the administration of the second vaccine dose, and at weeks 4-5 (ie, 1-2 weeks after the second vaccine dose). Participants with comorbidities were approached to participate in an enriched comorbidities subgroup, and at least two neutralising assays were done during the 5 weeks of follow-up in those individuals. IgG assays were done for the entire study population, whereas IgM, IgA, and neutralising antibody assays were done only in the enriched comorbidities subgroup. Concentrations of IgG greater than 0.62 sample-to-cutoff (s/co) ratio and of IgA greater than 1.1 s/co, and titres of neutralising antibodies greater than 10 were considered positive. Scatter plot and correlation analyses, logistic and linear regression analyses, and linear mixed models were used to investigate the longitudinal antibody responses. FINDINGS: Between Dec 19, 2020, and Jan 30, 2021, we obtained 4026 serum samples from 2607 eligible, vaccinated participants. 342 individuals were included in the enriched comorbidities subgroup. The first vaccine dose elicited positive IgG and neutralising antibody responses at week 3 in 707 (88.0%) of 803 individuals, and 264 (71.0%) of 372 individuals, respectively, which were rapidly increased at week 4 (ie, 1 week after the second vaccine dose) in 1011 (98.4%) of 1027 and 357 (96.5%) of 370 individuals, respectively. Over 4 weeks of follow-up after vaccination, a high correlation (r=0.92) was detected between IgG against the receptor-binding domain and neutralising antibody titres. First-dose induced IgG response was significantly lower in individuals aged 66 years and older (ratio of means 0.25, 95% CI 0.19-0.31) and immunosuppressed individuals (0.21, 0.14-0.31) compared with individuals aged 18.00-45.99 years and individuals with no immunosuppression, respectively. This disparity was partly abrogated following the second dose. Overall, endpoint regression analysis showed that lower antibody concentrations were consistently associated with male sex (ratio of means 0.84, 95% CI 0.80-0.89), older age (ie, >/=66 years; 0.64, 0.58-0.71), immunosuppression (0.44, 0.33-0.58), and other specific comorbidities: diabetes (0.88, 0.79-0.98), hypertension (0.90, 0.82-0.98), heart disease (0.86, 0.75-1.00), and autoimmune diseases (0.82, 0.73-0.92). INTERPRETATION: BNT162b2 vaccine induces a robust and rapid antibody response. The significant correlation between receptor-binding domain IgG antibodies and neutralisation titres suggests that IgG antibodies might serve as a correlate of neutralisation. The second vaccine dose is particularly important for older and immunosuppressed individuals, highlighting the need for timely second vaccinations and potentially a revaluation of the long gap between doses in some countries. Antibody responses were reduced in susceptible populations and therefore they might be more prone to breakthrough infections. FUNDING: Sheba Medical Center, Israel Ministry of Health.

34283141	A Vision-Based Social Distancing and Critical Density Detection System for COVID-19. Social distancing (SD) is an effective measure to prevent the spread of the infectious Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, a lack of spatial awareness may cause unintentional violations of this new measure. Against this backdrop, we propose an active surveillance system to slow the spread of COVID-19 by warning individuals in a region-of-interest. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce a vision-based real-time system that can detect SD violations and send non-intrusive audio-visual cues using state-of-the-art deep-learning models. Second, we define a novel critical social density value and show that the chance of SD violation occurrence can be held near zero if the pedestrian density is kept under this value. The proposed system is also ethically fair: it does not record data nor target individuals, and no human supervisor is present during the operation. The proposed system was evaluated across real-world datasets.	Prevention
34222055	Association between cardiometabolic risk factors and COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and mortality: a review. The novel coronavirus, which began spreading from China Wuhan and gradually spreaded to most countries, led to the announcement by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, as a new pandemic. The most important point presented by the World Health Organization about this disease is to better understand the risk factors that exacerbate the course of the disease and worsen its prognosis. Due to the high majority of cardio metabolic risk factors like obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia among the population over 60 years old and higher, these cardio metabolic risk factors along with the age of these people could worsen the prognosis of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and its mortality. In this study, we aimed to review the articles from the beginning of the pandemic on the impression of cardio metabolic risk factors on COVID-19 and the effectiveness of COVID-19 on how to manage these diseases. All the factors studied in this article, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and obesity exacerbate the course of Covid-19 disease by different mechanisms, and the inflammatory process caused by coronavirus can also create a vicious cycle in controlling these diseases for patients.

34292620	Clinicopathologic Findings in COVID-19-Associated Ischemic Enterocolitis. AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a predominantly respiratory tract infection, but some patients manifest severe systemic symptoms/coagulation abnormalities. We evaluated the impact of severe COVID-19 infection on the gastrointestinal tract. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined clinicopathologic findings in 28 resected ischemic bowels from 22 patients with severe COVID-19. Most patients required intubation preoperatively and presented with acute decompensation shortly before surgery. D-dimer levels were markedly elevated in all measured cases (mean: 5394 ng/mL). Histologically, 25 cases (19 patients) showed evidence of acute ischemia with necrosis. In this group, the most characteristic finding was the presence of small vessel fibrin thrombi (24/25 cases, 96%), which were numerous in 64% of cases. Compared to a control cohort of 35 non-COVID-19-related acute ischemic bowels, patients with COVID-19 were significantly more likely to show isolated small intestine involvement (32% vs. 6%, p<0.001), small vessel fibrin thrombi (100% vs. 43%, p<0.001), submucosal vessels with fibrinous degeneration and perivascular neutrophils (90% vs. 54%, p<0.001), fibrin strands within submucosal vessels (58% vs. 20%, p=0.007), and histologic evidence of pneumatosis (74% vs. 34%, p=0.010). Three cases in this cohort had histopathologic findings normally seen in the setting of chronic ischemia, notably prominent fibroblastic proliferation affecting the outer layer of the muscularis propria. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we describe the histopathologic findings in COVID-19-associated ischemic bowel and postulate a relationship to the hypercoagulable state seen in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Additional experience with these cases may further elucidate specific features or mechanisms of COVID-19-associated ischemic enterocolitis.	Diagnosis
34352727	Evaluation of anti-cancer and anti-covid-19 properties of cationic pentapeptide Glu-Gln-Arg-Pro-Arg, from rice bran protein and its d-isomer analogs through molecular docking simulations. Bioactive peptides derived from food proteins are becoming increasingly popular due to the growing awareness of their health-promoting properties. The structure and mechanism of anti-cancer action of pentapeptide Glu-Gln-Arg-Pro-Arg (EQRPR) derived from a rice bran protein are not known. Theoretical and experimental methods were employed to fill this gap. The conformation analysis of the EQRPR pentapeptide was performed first and the obtained lowest energy conformer was optimized. The experimental structural data obtained by FTIR and CD spectroscopies agree well with the theoretical results. d-isomer introduced one-by-one to each position and all D-isomers of the peptide were also examined for its possible anti-proteolytic and activity enhancement properties. The molecular docking revealed avid binding of the pentapeptide to the integrins alpha5beta1 and alphaIIbbeta3, with Kd values of 90 nM and 180 nM, respectively. Moreover, the EQRPR and its D-isomers showed strong binding affinities to apo- and holo-forms of M(pro), spike glycoprotein, ACE2, and dACE2. The predicted results indicate that the pentapeptide may significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the peptide has the potential to be the leading molecule in the drug discovery process as having multifunctional with diverse biological activities.	Mechanism;Treatment
34198858	Evidencing the Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Imposed Lockdown Measures on Fitness Status in Adolescents: A Preliminary Report. It was established that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in decreased physical activity levels, potentially leading to reduced physical fitness. The aim of this research was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on fitness indices in adolescents. We observed high school adolescents (33% girls; aged 15-17 years) divided into two cohorts. The first cohort (control; n = 48) included adolescents who were in school during the 2018/2019 year, while the second cohort (lockdown; n = 66) was observed during the school year 2019/2020 when COVID-19 lockdown measures were imposed. Variables included body height, body mass, BMI, sit-ups, and the 600 m dash. Both cohorts were tested at the beginning and at the end of the observed school years. A factorial analysis of variance for repeated measurements evidenced an improvement in sit-ups and the 600 m dash in the control, and a decrease of the same capacities in the lockdown cohort. In the lockdown cohort, a decrease in muscular fitness was more evident in boys than in girls. No differential changes between cohorts were evidenced in anthropometrics. Results suggest that the COVID-19 lockdown negatively influenced muscular fitness status in adolescents, especially in boys.	Prevention
34335019	Forecasting Multi-Wave Epidemics Through Bayesian Inference. We present a simple, near-real-time Bayesian method to infer and forecast a multiwave outbreak, and demonstrate it on the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach uses timely epidemiological data that has been widely available for COVID-19. It provides short-term forecasts of the outbreak's evolution, which can then be used for medical resource planning. The method postulates one- and multiwave infection models, which are convolved with the incubation-period distribution to yield competing disease models. The disease models' parameters are estimated via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and information-theoretic criteria are used to select between them for use in forecasting. The method is demonstrated on two- and three-wave COVID-19 outbreaks in California, New Mexico and Florida, as observed during Summer-Winter 2020. We find that the method is robust to noise, provides useful forecasts (along with uncertainty bounds) and that it reliably detected when the initial single-wave COVID-19 outbreaks transformed into successive surges as containment efforts in these states failed by the end of Spring 2020.

34284839	COVID-19 age-dependent immunology and clinical outcomes: implications for vaccines. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Understanding the evolution of the virus, and immune-pathogenic processes are critical for designing future therapeutic interventions. In this review, we collate information on the structure, genome, viral life cycle, and adult and pediatric host immune responses in response to SARS-CoV-2. The immunological responses are a prototype of the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis to explain the socio-geographic differences impacting the severity and mortality rates in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The DOHaD hypothesis identifies the relevance of trained innate immunity, age groups, and geography for effective vaccinations. As COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out, it may be pertinent to assess population-based immunological responses to understand the effectiveness and safety across different populations and age groups.

34220703	Covid-19 and Growth Hormone/Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1: Study in Critically and Non-Critically Ill Patients. Objective: We aimed to measure insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and growth hormone (GH) in critically and non-critically ill patients with Covid-19 and assess them vis-a-vis clinical and laboratory parameters and prognostic tools. Subjects and Methods: We included patients who were admitted to the wards or the ICU of the largest Covid-19 referral hospital in Greece; patients with non-Covid-19 pneumonia served as controls. Apart from the routine laboratory work-up for Covid-19 we measured GH and IGF1 (and calculated normalized IGF-1 values as standard deviation scores; SDS), after blood sampling upon admission to the wards or the ICU. Results: We studied 209 critically and non-critically ill patients with Covid-19 and 39 control patients. Patients with Covid-19 who were ICU non-survivors were older and presented with a worse hematological/biochemical profile (including white blood cell count, troponin, glucose, aminotransferases and lactate dehydrogenase) compared to ICU survivors or Covid-19 survivors in the wards. Overall, IGF-1 SDS was higher in Covid-19 survivors compared to non-survivors (-0.96 +/- 1.89 vs -2.05 +/- 2.48, respectively, p=0.030). No significant differences were noted in GH between the groups. Nevertheless, in critically ill patients with Covid-19, the prognostic value of IGF-1 (raw data), IGF-1 (SDS) and GH for survival/non-survival was on a par with that of APACHE II and SOFA (with a marginal difference between GH and SOFA). Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings suggest that there might be an association between low IGF1 (and possibly GH) and poor outcome in patients with Covid-19.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34212566	Compassionate mesenchymal stem cell treatment in a severe COVID-19 patient: a case report. COVID-19 presentations range from cold-like symptoms to severe symptoms with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We report on a severe COVID-19 patient who was mechanically ventilated and who developed ARDS and bacterial infection. Because of rapid clinical deterioration and the exhaustion of other treatment options, the family and attending physicians requested a compassionate use of adult allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in addition to commonly used immunosuppressive, antiviral, and supportive therapy. The clinical course is discussed thoroughly, with a special emphasis on the safety and effect of MSC therapy. Compassionate MSC treatment, given in three rounds, affected ARDS regression. The patient was discharged from the intensive care unit after 31 days and from hospital after 49 days in a good general condition. MSC treatment was not associated with any side effects and was well tolerated in a three-week period; therefore, it should be studied in larger trials and considered for compassionate use.

34204846	Enhance Portable Radiograph for Fast and High Accurate COVID-19 Monitoring. This work aimed to assist physicians by improving their speed and diagnostic accuracy when interpreting portable CXRs as well as monitoring the treatment process to see whether a patient is improving or deteriorating with treatment. These objectives are in especially high demand in the setting of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With the recent progress in the development of artificial intelligence (AI), we introduce new deep learning frameworks to align and enhance the quality of portable CXRs to be more consistent, and to more closely match higher quality conventional CXRs. These enhanced portable CXRs can then help the doctors provide faster and more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. The contributions of this work are four-fold. Firstly, a new database collection of subject-pair radiographs is introduced. For each subject, we collected a pair of samples from both portable and conventional machines. Secondly, a new deep learning approach is presented to align the subject-pairs dataset to obtain a pixel-pairs dataset. Thirdly, a new PairFlow approach is presented, an end-to-end invertible transfer deep learning method, to enhance the degraded quality of portable CXRs. Finally, the performance of the proposed system is evaluated by UAMS doctors in terms of both image quality and topological properties. This work was undertaken in collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) to enhance portable/mobile COVID-19 CXRs, to improve the speed and accuracy of portable CXR images and aid in urgent COVID-19 diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.

34209586	NLRP3 and Infections: beta-Amyloid in Inflammasome beyond Neurodegeneration. Amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced abnormal neuroinflammation is recognized as a major pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which results in memory impairment. Research exploring low-grade systemic inflammation and its impact on the development and progression of neurodegenerative disease has increased. A particular research focus has been whether systemic inflammation arises only as a secondary effect of disease, or it is also a cause of pathology. The inflammasomes, and more specifically the NLRP3 inflammasome, are crucial components of the innate immune system and are usually activated in response to infection or tissue damage. Although inflammasome activation plays critical roles against various pathogens in host defense, overactivation of inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including acute central nervous system (CNS) injuries and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. This review summarizes the current literature on the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of AD, and its involvement in infections, particularly SARS-CoV-2. NLRP3 might represent the crossroad between the hypothesized neurodegeneration and the primary COVID-19 infection.	Mechanism;Treatment
34289752	Supervised Molecular Dynamics (SuMD) Insights into the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor PF-07321332. The chemical structure of PF-07321332, the first orally available Covid-19 clinical candidate, has recently been revealed by Pfizer. No information has been provided about the interaction pattern between PF-07321332 and its biomolecular counterpart, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)). In the present work, we exploited Supervised Molecular Dynamics (SuMD) simulations to elucidate the key features that characterise the interaction between this drug candidate and the protease, emphasising similarities and differences with other structurally related inhibitors such as Boceprevir and PF-07304814. The structural insights provided by SuMD will hopefully be able to inspire the rational discovery of other potent and selective protease inhibitors.	Mechanism;Treatment
34375715	A tetrameric ACE2 protein broadly neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 spike variants of concern with elevated potency. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was previously engineered into a high affinity tetravalent format (ACE2-Fc-TD) that is a potential decoy protein in SARS-CoV-2 infection.We report that this protein shows greatly enhanced binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern B.1.1.7 (alpha variant, originally isolated in the United Kingdom) and B.1.351 (beta variant, originally isolated in South Africa) with picomolar compared with nanomolar Kd values. In addition, ACE2-Fc-TD displays greater neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype viruses compared to a dimeric ACE2-Fc, with enhanced activity on variant B.1.351. This tetrameric decoy protein would be a valuable addition to SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic approaches, especially where vaccination cannot be used but also should there be any future coronavirus pandemics.

34213760	Subtotal colectomy for refractory ulcerative colitis with COVID-19 infection; a first case report in Japan. We report a 60-year-old male who was transferred to our hospital for the operation because of refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). He was diagnosed to be infected with COVID-19 for SARS-CoV-2 PCR test positive at the time of transfer. We determined emergency operation because his general condition was poor such as malnutrition and ADL decline due to exacerbation of UC and air embolization by central venous catheter removal. He underwent subtotal colectomy with a sigmoid mucous fistula and ileostomy. He was well postoperatively. This is a first case report in Japan who underwent an operation for UC with COVID-19 infection.	Case Report
33566839	Adaptive social contact rates induce complex dynamics during epidemics. Epidemics may pose a significant dilemma for governments and individuals. The personal or public health consequences of inaction may be catastrophic; but the economic consequences of drastic response may likewise be catastrophic. In the face of these trade-offs, governments and individuals must therefore strike a balance between the economic and personal health costs of reducing social contacts and the public health costs of neglecting to do so. As risk of infection increases, potentially infectious contact between people is deliberately reduced either individually or by decree. This must be balanced against the social and economic costs of having fewer people in contact, and therefore active in the labor force or enrolled in school. Although the importance of adaptive social contact on epidemic outcomes has become increasingly recognized, the most important properties of coupled human-natural epidemic systems are still not well understood. We develop a theoretical model for adaptive, optimal control of the effective social contact rate using traditional epidemic modeling tools and a utility function with delayed information. This utility function trades off the population-wide contact rate with the expected cost and risk of increasing infections. Our analytical and computational analysis of this simple discrete-time deterministic strategic model reveals the existence of an endemic equilibrium, oscillatory dynamics around this equilibrium under some parametric conditions, and complex dynamic regimes that shift under small parameter perturbations. These results support the supposition that infectious disease dynamics under adaptive behavior change may have an indifference point, may produce oscillatory dynamics without other forcing, and constitute complex adaptive systems with associated dynamics. Implications for any epidemic in which adaptive behavior influences infectious disease dynamics include an expectation of fluctuations, for a considerable time, around a quasi-equilibrium that balances public health and economic priorities, that shows multiple peaks and surges in some scenarios, and that implies a high degree of uncertainty in mathematical projections.

34281995	Telemammography for breast cancer screening: a cost-effective approach in Argentina. OBJECTIVES: Argentina is a low and middle-income country (LMIC) with a highly fragmented healthcare system that conflicts with access to healthcare stated by the country's Universal Health Coverage plan. A tele-mammography network could improve access to breast cancer screening decreasing its mortality. This research aims to conduct an economic evaluation of the implementation of a tele-mammography program to improve access to healthcare. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed to explore the incremental benefit of annual tele-mammography screening for at-risk Argentinian women over 40 years old. A Markov model was developed to simulate annual mammography or tele-mammography screening in two hypothetical population-based cohorts of asymptomatic women. Parameter uncertainty was evaluated through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Model structure uncertainty was also explored to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: It was estimated that 31 out of 100 new cases of breast cancer would be detected by mammography and 39/100 by tele-mammography. The model returned an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound26 051/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) which is lower than the WHO-recommended threshold of pound26 288/QALY for Argentina. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed the ICER is most sensitive to the uptake and sensitivity of the screening tests. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed tele-mammography is cost-effective in 59% of simulations. DISCUSSION: Tele-mammography should be considered for adoption as it could improve access to expertise in underserved areas where adherence to screening protocols is poor. Disaggregated data by province is needed for a better- informed policy decision. Telemedicine could also be beneficial in ensuring the continuity of care when health systems are under stress like in the current COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: There is a 59% chance that tele-mammography is cost-effective compared to mammography for at-risk Argentinian women over 40- years old, and should be adopted to improve access to healthcare in underserved areas of the country.

34289965	Head home: implementation during COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that between 20% and 50% of paediatric head injuries attending our emergency department (ED) could be safely discharged soon after triage, without the need for medical review, using a 'Head Injury Discharge At Triage' tool (HIDAT). We sought to implement this into clinical practice. METHODS: Paediatric ED triage staff underwent competency-based assessments for HIDAT with all head injury presentations 1 May to 31 October 2020 included in analysis. We determined which patients were discharged using the tool, which underwent CT of the brain and whether there was a clinically important traumatic brain injury or representation to the ED. RESULTS: Of the 1429 patients screened; 610 (43%) screened negative with 250 (18%) discharged by nursing staff. Of the entire cohort, 32 CTs were performed for head injury concerns (6 abnormal) with 1 CT performed in the HIDAT negative group (normal). Of those discharged using HIDAT, four reattended, two with vomiting (no imaging or admission) and two with minor scalp wound infections. Two patients who screened negative declined discharge under the policy with later medical discharge (no imaging or admission). Paediatric ED attendances were 29% lower than in 2018. CONCLUSION: We have successfully implemented HIDAT into local clinical practice. The number discharged (18%) is lower than originally described; this is likely multifactorial. The relationship between COVID-19 and paediatric ED attendances is unclear but decreased attendances suggest those for whom the tool was originally designed are not attending ED and may be accessing other medical/non-medical resources.

34216306	Predictors of survival in older adults hospitalized with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate clinical characteristics associated with mortality and predictors of survival in older adults hospitalized with COVID-19 with a focus on neurological comorbidities and presenting neurological manifestations. METHODS: We compared clinical characteristics in an age- and gender-matched sample of 75 deceased and 75 recovered patients (MAge = 78) hospitalized with COVID-19 and developed a logistic regression to predict likelihood of survival. RESULTS: Deceased patients were more like to have dementia, altered mental status (AMS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, mechanical ventilation, and balance difficulties; higher heart rate, respiratory rate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and absolute neutrophils; lower oxygen saturation and absolute lymphocytes; and shorter length of hospitalization. Logistic regression based on three mortality predictors (ARDS, AMS, and length of hospitalization) correctly predicted 87% of the outcome (89% sensitivity at 85% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: Dementia and AMS were strong predictors of death in older adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Our findings add to the rapidly growing neurology of COVID-19 literature and underscore the importance of early recognition and the incorporation of a mental status examination into the medical assessment of COVID-19.

34377601	Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on Ocular Surface Pathology and Treatment Practices: a Review. Purpose of Review: The ocular surface is a potential site of ocular involvement by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a review of the literature to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 disease manifestations on the ocular surface as well as to elucidate emerging treatment patterns and practice changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent Findings: The ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are likely limited to a mild and transient conjunctivitis. Other manifestations have not been validated in larger cohorts. Ocular surface tissue should be considered potentially infectious due to the presence of host receptors on surface tissues. The availability of donor tissue in lower-middle income countries has been greatly impacted by the pandemic and would benefit from further investigation into transmissibility through donor tissue. Summary: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the ocular surface has yet to be confirmed. The most common ocular manifestation is a mild conjunctivitis. Ocular surface surgeons face specific challenges in the use of donor tissues and aerosolizing procedures and have adapted practice patterns accordingly.	Diagnosis;Prevention;Transmission
34201505	The Fight against COVID-19 on the Multi-Protease Front and Surroundings: Could an Early Therapeutic Approach with Repositioning Drugs Prevent the Disease Severity? The interaction between the membrane spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of the human epithelial host cell is the first step of infection, which has a critical role for viral pathogenesis of the current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Following the binding between S1 subunit and ACE2 receptor, different serine proteases, including TMPRSS2 and furin, trigger and participate in the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. On the basis of the high virulence and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, other receptors have been found involved for viral binding and invasiveness of host cells. This review comprehensively discusses the mechanisms underlying the binding of SARS-CoV2 to ACE2 and putative alternative receptors, and the role of potential co-receptors and proteases in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the short therapeutic time window within which to act to avoid the devastating evolution of the disease, we focused on potential therapeutic treatments-selected mainly among repurposing drugs-able to counteract the invasive front of proteases and mild inflammatory conditions, in order to prevent severe infection. Using existing approved drugs has the advantage of rapidly proceeding to clinical trials, low cost and, consequently, immediate and worldwide availability.	Mechanism;Treatment
34213751	Learning from Crisis: a Multicentre Study of Oncology Telemedicine Clinics Introduced During COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated adaptation of cancer patient care. Oncology patients who contract COVID-19 have poor outcomes. Telemedicine clinics (teleclinics) have been introduced for cancer patients to reduce the risk of horizontal transmission at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and The Royal Free Hospital in London. Teleclinics have become routine in many specialities; however, inclusion in oncology care was not standard prior to the pandemic. A mixed-methods survey was designed and delivered to cancer patients (n = 106) at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and The Royal Free Hospital who had transitioned to teleclinics in March 2020. The survey explored patients' perceptions of this format. In total, 96 (90.5%) patients consented to take part, across a range of tumour types. Overall, respondents reacted favourably to the format of the teleclinics, with 90.6% of respondents (87/96) stating they would utilise teleclinics beyond the pandemic. Additionally, a survey was distributed to clinicians delivering these teleclinics (n = 16) to explore previous training in, perceptions of, and lessons learned from the introduction of telemedicine. Results suggest patients are accepting of teleclinic use for most clinical purposes. Teleclinic implementation affords benefits to cancer patient care both during and after COVID-19, but there is an urgent need for telemedicine education in oncology specialty training.	Prevention
34206357	Development and Validation of a Method for Quantification of Favipiravir as COVID-19 Management in Spiked Human Plasma. In the current work, a simple, economical, accurate, and precise HPLC method with UV detection was developed to quantify Favipiravir (FVIR) in spiked human plasma using acyclovir (ACVR) as an internal standard in the COVID-19 pandemic time. Both FVIR and ACVR were well separated and resolved on the C18 column using the mobile phase blend of methanol:acetonitrile:20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3.1) in an isocratic mode flow rate of 1 mL/min with a proportion of 30:10:60 %, v/v/v. The detector wavelength was set at 242 nm. Maximum recovery of FVIR and ACVR from plasma was obtained with dichloromethane (DCM) as extracting solvent. The calibration curve was found to be linear in the range of 3.1-60.0 microg/mL with regression coefficient (r(2)) = 0.9976. However, with acceptable r(2), the calibration data's heteroscedasticity was observed, which was further reduced using weighted linear regression with weighting factor 1/x. Finally, the method was validated concerning sensitivity, accuracy (Inter and Intraday's % RE and RSD were 0.28, 0.65 and 1.00, 0.12 respectively), precision, recovery (89.99%, 89.09%, and 90.81% for LQC, MQC, and HQC, respectively), stability (% RSD for 30-day were 3.04 and 1.71 for LQC and HQC, respectively at -20 degrees C), and carry-over US-FDA guidance for Bioanalytical Method Validation for researchers in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Furthermore, there was no significant difference for selectivity when evaluated at LLOQ concentration of 3 microg/mL of FVIR and relative to the blank.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34202217	Active Aging Governance and Challenges at the Local Level. International and national guidelines have been promoting active aging while creating the necessary means for decision-makers and other relevant actors to work together (governance mechanisms) to implement local and active aging policies. This is especially important in the present COVID-19 pandemic context, posing greater challenges on older people who tend to be self-isolated. How are local actors conceptualizing active aging? What are their priorities related to a healthy life for older people? Which governance mechanisms are used to implement such policies? These are some of the questions addressed in this paper, targeting Portugal, a southern European country. A mixed-methods sequential explanatory design combining a survey conducted at a national level and interviews with key actors in the NUTS III Aveiro Region was employed to identify and understand the underpinning governance mechanisms. Findings confirm the 'passive organization type' in which European politico-territorial studies tend to place Portugal, as there are gaps in the way policies are formulated, implemented and evaluated, as well as a lack of coordination. Results of this study have important impacts on the way local governments and other stakeholders will prepare themselves in the post-pandemic period to design and implement policies addressing active aging.

34198838	Acute Myocardial Infarction Due to Microvascular Obstruction in a Young Woman Who Recently Recovered from COVID-19 Infection. Although cardiovascular complications are common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, those with milder cases who recovered at home are less studied. Here, we report the case of a young woman who recently recovered from COVID-19 at home. A week after recovery, she was admitted to our institution with acute chest pain, signs of ischemia on the electrocardiogram and elevated cardiac troponins. Coronary angiography showed normal epicardial coronary arteries, but the cardiac magnetic resonance showed transmural late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the mid-ventricular level of the lateral wall. The findings were strongly suggestive of a minor transmural myocardial infarction. This case report highlights the role of multimodality imaging in detecting cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients as well as the fact that mild COVID-19 cases who recovered at home are also exposed to thromboembolic events during the convalescent period.

34220286	Mask R-CNN-based building extraction from VHR satellite data in operational humanitarian action: An example related to Covid-19 response in Khartoum, Sudan. Within the constraints of operational work supporting humanitarian organizations in their response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we conducted building extraction for Khartoum, Sudan. We extracted approximately 1.2 million dwellings and buildings, using a Mask R-CNN deep learning approach from a Pleiades very high-resolution satellite image with 0.5 m pixel resolution. Starting from an untrained network, we digitized a few hundred samples and iteratively increased the number of samples by validating initial classification results and adding them to the sample collection. We were able to strike a balance between the need for timely information and the accuracy of the result by combining the output from three different models, each aiming at distinctive types of buildings, in a post-processing workflow. We obtained a recall of 0.78, precision of 0.77 and F 1 score of 0.78, and were able to deliver first results in only 10 days after the initial request. The procedure shows the great potential of convolutional neural network frameworks in combination with GIS routines for dwelling extraction even in an operational setting.	Prevention
34293137	Placental expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection: are placental defenses mediated by fetal sex? BACKGROUND: Sex differences in vulnerability to and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described in non-pregnant populations. ACE2 and TMPRSS2, host molecules required for viral entry, are regulated by sex steroids and expressed in the placenta. We sought to investigate whether placental ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression vary by fetal sex and in the presence of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Placental ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were quantified in 68 pregnant individuals (38 SARS-CoV-2 positive, 30 SARS-CoV-2 negative) delivering at Mass General Brigham from April to June 2020. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 status was determined by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. Placental SARS-CoV-2 viral load was quantified. RTqPCR was performed to quantify expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 relative to the reference gene YWHAZ. Western blots were performed on placental homogenates to quantify protein levels. The impact of fetal sex and SARS-CoV-2 exposure on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 virus was undetectable in all placentas. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection impacted TMPRSS2 placental gene and protein expression in a sexually dimorphic fashion (2-way ANOVA interaction p-value: 0.002). We observed no impact of fetal sex or maternal SARS-CoV-2 status on placental ACE2 gene or protein expression. Placental TMPRSS2 expression was significantly correlated with ACE2 expression in males (Spearman's rho=0.54, p=0.02) but not females (rho=0.23, p=0.34) exposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Sex differences in placental TMPRSS2 but not ACE2 were observed in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings may have implications for offspring vulnerability to placental infection.	Mechanism;Treatment
34207394	Evaluation of Side Effects Associated with COVID-19 Vaccines in Saudi Arabia. BACKGROUND: Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca are recently introduced vaccines to combat COVID-19 pandemic. During clinical trials, mild to moderate side effects have been associated with these vaccines. Thus, we aimed to evaluate short-term post-vaccination side effects. METHODS: Cross-sectional, retrospective study using an online questionnaire was conducted among COVID-19 vaccines recipients in Saudi Arabia. General and demographic data were collected, and vaccine-associated side effects after receiving at least one dose of each vaccine were evaluated. RESULTS: Our final sample consisted of 515 participants with a median age of 26 years. Most of the study participants were female (57%). Nearly 13% of the study subjects have reported previous infections with SARS-CoV-2. Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines have been received by 75% and 25% of the study participants, respectively. Side effects associated with COVID-19 vaccines have been reported by 60% of the study subjects, and most of them reported fatigue (90%), pain at the site of the injections (85%). CONCLUSION: Side effects that are reported post Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines among our study participants are not different from those that were reported in the clinical trials, indicating safe profiles for both vaccines. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the current vaccines in protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfections.	Treatment
34288409	COVID-19 vaccines: what do we know so far? When the novel coronavirus was described in late 2019, it could not have been imagined that within a year, more than 100 vaccine candidates would be in preclinical development and several would be in clinical trials and even approved for use. The scale of the COVID-19 outbreak pushed the scientific community, working in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, public health bodies, policymakers, funders and governments, to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 at record-breaking speed. As well as driving major amendments to the usual timeframe for bringing a vaccine to fruition, the pandemic has accelerated the development of next-generation technologies for vaccinology, giving rise to two frontrunner RNA vaccines. Although none of the critical safety and efficacy steps have been skipped within the compressed schedules, and the technologies underpinning the novel vaccines have been refined by scientists over many years, a significant proportion of the global population is sceptical of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines and wary of potential risks. In this interview-based article, we give an overview of how the vaccines were developed and how they work to generate a robust immune response against COVID-19, as well as addressing common questions relating to safety and efficacy.

34291225	Natriuretic Peptide Levels and Clinical Outcomes Among Patients Hospitalized With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection. OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence of cardiovascular morbidity associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019). Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide is a biomarker of myocardial stress, associated with various respiratory and cardiac outcomes. We hypothesized that pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level would be associated with mortality and clinical outcomes in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients. DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis using adjusted logistic and linear regression to assess the association of admission pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (analyzed by both cutoff > 125 pg/mL and log transformed pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) with clinical outcomes. We additionally treated body mass index, a confounder of both pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels and coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes, as an ordinal variable. SETTING: We reviewed hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who had a pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level measured within 48 hours of admission between March 1, and August 31, 2020, from a multihospital U.S. health system. PATIENTS: Adult patients (>/= 18 yr old; n = 1232) with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to the health system. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and troponin I level, higher pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level was significantly associated with death and secondary outcomes of new heart failure, length of stay, ICU duration, and need for ventilation among hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients. This significance persisted after adjustment for body mass index as an ordinal variable. The adjusted hazard ratio of death for log transformed pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.23-1.97; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Further investigation is warranted on the utility of pro-B-type natriuretic peptide for clinical prognostication in coronavirus disease 2019 as well as implications of abnormal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in the underlying pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019-related myocardial injury.

34290789	Risk of Covid-19 infection during endoscopy: Efficacy of personal protective equipment (PPE) in protecting health professionals. Objectives: To correlate compliance to personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols and risk of exposure to SARS-COV-2 infection in endoscopy staff. Methods: We included 85 endoscopic procedures performed at Lahore General Hospital from May to July 2020. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) were implemented for patient selection, risk stratification and personal protective equipment (PPE) use for endoscopy staff. Patient and endoscopy staff were followed for Covid-19 infection. PPE scores for staff and Covid-19 positivity on follow-up were correlated using student's t test. Results: Following 85 procedures included, 2 (2.3%) patients became Covid-19 positive. PPE score was <9 in 5 (5.8%) procedures for endoscopist and Covid-19 developed in 2 (2.3%) of them, PPE score was <9 during 19 (22.3%) procedures in 1(st) assistant and 9 (10.5%) developed infection and for 2(nd) assistant PPE score was <9 in 19(22.3%) endoscopies and 5 (5.9%) tested positive for covid-19. Infectivity of endoscopy staff was 6.2%. Association between PPE score and risk of Covid-19 was not significant. (p value 0.51 for endoscopist, 0.10 for 1(st) assistant and 0.09 for 2(nd) assistant). Conclusion: Compliance of SOPs for infection control reduces risk of acquiring Covid-19 infection during endoscopy. Proper use of PPE is effective for safety of endoscopy staff.	Prevention
34220684	Early Effects of Passive Leg-Raising Test, Fluid Challenge, and Norepinephrine on Cerebral Autoregulation and Oxygenation in COVID-19 Critically Ill Patients. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are at high risk of neurological complications consequent to several factors including persistent hypotension. There is a paucity of data on the effects of therapeutic interventions designed to optimize systemic hemodynamics on cerebral autoregulation (CA) in this group of patients. Methods: Single-center, observational prospective study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy, from October 1 to December 15, 2020. Mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, who had at least one episode of hypotension and received a passive leg raising (PLR) test, were included. They were then treated with fluid challenge (FC) and/or norepinephrine (NE), according to patients' clinical conditions, at different moments. The primary outcome was to assess the early effects of PLR test and of FC and NE [when clinically indicated to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP)] on CA (CA index) measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD). Secondary outcomes were to evaluate the effects of PLR test, FC, and NE on systemic hemodynamic variables, cerebral oxygenation (rSo2), and non-invasive intracranial pressure (nICP). Results: Twenty-three patients were included and underwent PLR test. Of these, 22 patients received FC and 14 were treated with NE. The median age was 62 years (interquartile range = 57-68.5 years), and 78% were male. PLR test led to a low CA index [58% (44-76.3%)]. FC and NE administration resulted in a CA index of 90.8% (74.2-100%) and 100% (100-100%), respectively. After PLR test, nICP based on pulsatility index and nICP based on flow velocity diastolic formula was increased [18.6 (17.7-19.6) vs. 19.3 (18.2-19.8) mm Hg, p = 0.009, and 12.9 (8.5-18) vs. 15 (10.5-19.7) mm Hg, p = 0.001, respectively]. PLR test, FC, and NE resulted in a significant increase in MAP and rSo2. Conclusions: In mechanically ventilated severe COVID-19 patients, PLR test adversely affects CA. An individualized strategy aimed at assessing both the hemodynamic and cerebral needs is warranted in patients at high risk of neurological complications.	Treatment
34222306	Effects of the Mediterranean Lifestyle During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Spain: Preliminary Study. We aim to assess the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean style-diet before and after the period of confinement due to COVID-19 in a sample of 51 older patients who were part of a clinical trial of the Instituto de Investigacion sanitaria y Biomedica de Alicante (ISABIAL, CEIM). Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: experimental vs. a control group. A pre-test survey assessment was conducted before confinement, while a post-test survey was conducted after the confinement period. Adherence to Mediterranean Diet and nutritional status were evaluated through self-reported questionnaires. Individuals who initiated the Mediterranean Diet intervention program before confinement increased 3.5% their level of adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and maintained their nutritional status after the confinement. In the case of BMI, there no were statistically significant differences between groups before and after confinement. These results suggest that adherence to the Mediterranean Diet may play an important role in the establishment of appropriate dietary guidelines in confinement situations such as the COVID-19.

34227711	Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: A single-center experience. BACKGROUND: This case series aims to evaluate the presenting symptoms, laboratory data, systemic findings, and response to early treatment in patients who were followed up with the diagnosis of multisystemic inflammatory syndrome associated with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The presentation, laboratory findings, and responses to treatment of patients hospitalized and diagnosed with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients were included in the study. The median age was 90 (1.5-204) months and 62.5% of the patients were male; 59.4% of the cases were non-specific disease, 31.2% typical (complete) Kawasaki, and 9.4% had phenotypic characteristics of atypical (incomplete) Kawasaki. Most of the patients were found to have low albumin and elevated C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, and d-dimer, and all patients had elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and procalcitonin. Lymphopenia was detected in 25 patients (78.1%) and serum ferritin levels were elevated in 25 patients (78.1%). Eleven (34.4%) patients responded well only to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. Twenty patients (62.5%) received intravenous immunoglobulin and steroid therapy (second-line therapy). Only one patient (3.1%) received third-line therapy (intravenous immunoglobulin + steroid +anakinra + plasmapheresis). None of the patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients had mild clinical symptoms and responded well to intravenous immunoglobulin and / or steroid therapies as first- and second-line therapies. Only one of our patients was clinically stabilized after third-line treatment because he did not respond to intravenous immunoglobulin and steroid therapy. We think that all of our patients diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children recovered because we had recommended quickly medical intervention. Treatment should therefore be started immediately in patients diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. If there is no response after 24 h to the initial treatment, the next treatment protocol should be started.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34289966	Diagnostic yield of bacteriological tests and predictors of severe outcome in adult patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department. BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend maximal efforts to obtain blood and sputum cultures in patients with COVID-19, as bacterial coinfection is associated with worse outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield of bacteriological tests, including blood and sputum cultures, and the association of multiple biomarkers and the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) with clinical and microbiological outcomes in patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This is a substudy of a large observational cohort study (PredictED study). The PredictED included adult patients from whom a blood culture was drawn at the ED of Haga Teaching Hospital, The Netherlands. For this substudy, all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in March and April 2020 were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of bacterial coinfection. We used logistic regression analysis for associations of procalcitonin, C reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lymphocyte count and PSI score with a severe disease course, defined as intensive care unit admission and/or 30-day mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) quantified the discriminatory performance. RESULTS: We included 142 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. On presentation, the median duration of symptoms was 8 days. 41 (29%) patients had a severe disease course and 24 (17%) died within 30 days. The incidence of bacterial coinfection was 2/142 (1.4%). None of the blood cultures showed pathogen growth while 6.3% was contaminated. The AUCs for predicting severe disease were 0.76 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.84), 0.70 (0.61 to 0.79), 0.62 (0.51 to 0.74), 0.62 (0.51 to 0.72) and 0.72 (0.63 to 0.81) for procalcitonin, CRP, ferritin, lymphocyte count and PSI score, respectively. CONCLUSION: Blood cultures appear to have limited value while procalcitonin and the PSI appear to be promising tools in helping physicians identify patients at risk for severe disease course in COVID-19 at presentation to the ED.

34342734	The Care of the Leukemic Patients in Times of SARS-CoV-2. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), has significantly derailed cancer care. Patients with leukemia are more likely to have severe infection and increased rates of mortality. There is paucity of information on how to modify care of leukemia patients in view of the COVID-19 risks and imposed restrictions. We review the available literature on the impact of COVID-19 on different types of leukemia patients and suggest general as well as disease-specific recommendations on care based on available evidence. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 infection impacts leukemia subtypes in variable ways and the standard treatments for leukemia have similarly, varying effects on the course of COVID-19 infection. Useful treatment strategies include deferring treatment when possible, use of less intensive regimens, outpatient targeted oral agents requiring minimal monitoring, and prioritization of curative or life-prolonging strategies. Reducing health care encounters, rational transfusion standards, just resource allocation, and pre-emptive advance care planning will serve the interests of leukemia patients. Ad hoc modifications based on expert opinions and extrapolations of previous well-designed studies are the way forward to navigate the crisis. This should be supplanted with more rigorous prospective evidence.	Prevention
34333121	DimachkieSpectrum of Acute Neuropathy Associated with Covid-19: Clinical and electrophysiological study of 13 patients from a single center. OBJECTIVES: To analyze clinical and nerve conduction patterns in patients with acute neuropathy, preceded by or concomitantly having Covid-19 disease (Acute Neuropathy Associated with Covid-19 or ANAC 19). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical details, laboratory evaluation and electrophysiological parameters in patients with ANAC 19was done. This data was compared with non Covid GBS described in literature and also with patients of acute neuropathy without Covid 19 who had presented to our center during the period of study. RESULTS: Records of thirteen patients with ANAC 19were reviewed. Most patients clinically had paraparesis, and electrophysiologically showed demyelinating neuropathy. Peroneal and Sural nerves were the most frequently abnormal motor and sensory nerves respectively. A proportion of patients showed a peroneal velocity sparing pattern. Higher incidence of paraparesis and encephalopathy differentiated ANAC 19from non Covid GBS. CONCLUSIONS: ANAC 19has a comparable electrophysiological profile to non Covid GBS. However, it has a distinct clinical presentation.	Diagnosis
34209725	Efficacy of Telemedicine and Telemonitoring in At-Home Monitoring of Patients with COVID-19. AIM: this work aims to assess if telemedicine and telemonitoring are clinically useful and safe for at-home monitoring of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Galicia (Northwestern Spain) between 26 December 2020 and 15 February 2021. The structured, proactive monitoring via telemonitoring (TELEA) of patients considered to be high-risk in the Lugo, A Marina, and Monforte Healthcare Area (ASLAM) was evaluated compared to other models in the remaining healthcare areas of Galicia. RESULTS: Of the 47,053 COVID-19 patients, 4384 (9.3%) were in ASLAM. Of them, 1187 (27.1%) were monitored via TELEA, and the rest (3197 in ASLAM and 42,669 in the rest of Galicia) were monitored via other methods. Patients monitored in ASLAM via TELEA were older, consulted in the emergency department less frequently (p = 0.05), were hospitalized less frequently (p < 0.01), had shorter hospital stays (p < 0.0001), and had a lower mortality rate in their first hospitalization (p = 0.03). No at-home life-threatening emergencies were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: these data suggest that, for COVID-19 patients, a care model involving proactive at-home monitoring with telemedicine and telemonitoring is associated with reduced pressure on hospital services and a lower mortality rate.

34133162	Interactive Interface for Graph-Based Analyses of Dynamic H-Bond Networks: Application to Spike Protein S. Dynamic hydrogen-bond networks are key determinants of protein conformational dynamics. In the case of macromolecular protein complexes, which can have a large number of hydrogen bonds giving rise to extensive hydrogen-bond networks, efficient algorithms are required to analyze interactions that could be important for the dynamics and biological function of the complex. We present here a highly efficient, standalone interface designed for analyses of dynamical hydrogen-bond networks of biomolecules and macromolecular complexes. To facilitate a comprehensive description of protein dynamics, the interface includes analyses of hydrophobic interactions. We illustrate the usefulness and workflow of the interface by dissecting the dynamics of the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 protein S in its closed conformation. We find that protein S contains numerous local clusters of dynamic hydrogen bonds and identify hydrogen bonds that are sampled persistently. The receptor binding domain of the spike protein hosts only a handful of persistent hydrogen-bond clusters, suggesting structural plasticity. Our data analysis interface is released here for open use.	Mechanism
34201285	"Modelling Voluntary General Population Vaccination Strategies during COVID-19 Outbreak: Influence of Disease Prevalence. A novel statistical model based on a two-layer, contact and information, graph is suggested in order to study the influence of disease prevalence on voluntary general population vaccination during the COVID-19 outbreak. Details about the structure and number of susceptible, infectious, and recovered/vaccinated individuals from the contact layer are simultaneously transferred to the information layer. The ever-growing wealth of information that is becoming available about the COVID virus was modelled at each individual level by a simplified proxy predictor of the amount of disease spread. Each informed individual, a node in a heterogeneous graph, makes a decision about vaccination ""motivated"" by their benefit. The obtained results showed that disease information type, global or local, has a significant impact on an individual vaccination decision. A number of different scenarios were investigated. The scenarios showed that in the case of the stronger impact of globally broadcasted disease information, individuals tend to vaccinate in larger numbers at the same time when the infection has already spread within the population. If individuals make vaccination decisions based on locally available information, the vaccination rate is uniformly spread during infection outbreak duration. Prioritising elderly population vaccination leads to an increased number of infected cases and a higher reduction in mortality. The developed model accuracy allows the precise targeting of vaccination order depending on the individuals' number of social contacts. Precisely targeted vaccination, combined with pre-existing immunity, and public health measures can limit the infection to isolated hotspots inside the population, as well as significantly delay and lower the infection peak."

34333650	The emergence and transmission of COVID-19 in European countries, 2019-2020: a comprehensive review of timelines, cases and containment. When it emerged in late 2019, COVID-19 was carried via travelers to Germany, France and Italy, where freedom of movement accelerated its transmission throughout Europe. However, effective non-pharmaceutical interventions introduced by European governments led to containment of the rapid increase in cases within European nations. Electronic searches were performed to obtain the number of confirmed cases, incident rates and non-pharmaceutical government measures for each European country. The spread and impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions throughout Europe were assessed and visualized. Specifically, heatmaps were used to represent the number of confirmed cases and incident rates for each of the countries over time. In addition, maps were created showing the number of confirmed cases and incident rates in Europe on three different dates (15 March, 15 April and 15 May 2020), which allowed us to assess the geographic and temporal patterns of the disease.

34370408	A variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: AMSAN. Introduction - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection that has rapidly become a global pandemic and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed with great success. In this article, we would like to present a patient who developed Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), which is a serious complication after receiving the inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac). Case report - A 76-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with nine days of progressive limb weakness. Two weeks prior to admission, he received the second dose of CoronaVac vaccine. Motor examination revealed decreased extremity strength with 3/5 in the lower extremities versus 4/5 in the upper extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in all four extremities. Nerve conduction studies showed predominantly reduced amplitude in both motor and sensory nerves, consistent with AMSAN (acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy). Conclusion - Clinicians should be aware of the neuro-logical complications or other side effects associated with COVID-19 vaccination so that early treatment can be an option.	Case Report
34133724	United States Medicolegal Progress and Innovation in Telemedicine in the Age of COVID-19: A Primer for Neurosurgeons. Telemedicine has received increased attention in recent years as a potential solution to expand clinical capability and patient access to care in many fields, including neurosurgery. Although patient and physician attitudes are rapidly shifting toward greater telemedicine use in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains uncertainty about telemedicine's regulatory future. Despite growing evidence of telemedicine's utility, there remain a number of significant medicolegal barriers to its mass adoption and wider implementation. Herein, we examine recent progress in state and federal regulations in the United States governing telemedicine's implementation in quality of care, finance and billing, privacy and confidentiality, risk and liability, and geography and interstate licensure, with special attention to how these concern teleneurosurgical practice. We also review contemporary topics germane to the future of teleneurosurgery, including the continued expansion of reciprocity in interstate licensure, expanded coverage for homecare services for chronic conditions, expansion of Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimbursements, and protections of store-and-forward technologies. Additionally, we discuss recent successes in teleneurosurgery, stroke care, and rehabilitation as models for teleneurosurgical best practices. As telemedicine technology continues to mature and its expanse grows, neurosurgeons' familiarity with its benefits, limitations, and controversies will best allow for its successful adoption in our field to maximize patient care and outcomes.

34208959	Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers in Uganda: A Cross-Sectional Survey. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of COVID-19. However, data on HCWs' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 are limited. Between September and November 2020, we conducted a questionnaire-based COVID-19 KAP survey among HCWs at three hospitals in Uganda. We used Bloom's cut-off of >/=80% to determine sufficient knowledge, good attitude, and good practice, and multivariate Poisson regression with robust variance for statistical analysis. Of 717 HCWs invited to participate, 657 (91.6%) agreed and were enrolled. The mean age (standard deviation) of enrollees was 33.2 (10.2) years; most were clinical HCWs (64.7%) and had advanced secondary school/other higher-level education (57.8%). Overall, 83.9% had sufficient knowledge, 78.4% had a positive attitude, and 37.0% had good practices toward COVID-19. Factors associated with KAP were: Knowledge: being a clinical HCW (aRR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.02-1.23) and previous participation in health research (aRR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.04-1.17); Attitude: age > 35 years (aRR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79-0.98); Practice: being a clinical HCW (aRR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.41-2.59). HCWs in Uganda have good knowledge and positive attitude but poor practices towards COVID-19. Differences in COVID-19 KAP between clinical and non-clinical HCWs could affect uptake of COVID-19 interventions including vaccination.	Prevention
34226855	The COVID-19 pandemic: Stay Home policy and exposure to risks of infection among Nigerians. The global threat which continues to accompany SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global response which adopts lockdown and stays home policy as means of curtailing its spread. This study investigates compliance with the Stay Home policy and exposure to COVID-19 in Nigeria. A survey was conducted from April 4 to May 8, 2020 using a cross-sectional mixed-methods approach to elicit responses from 879 participants across six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Descriptive, chi (2), and multiple regression tests were used to analyze survey data using SPSS, whereas NVivo v12 was used for thematic analysis of qualitative data. States with complete lockdown had 72.4% of respondents complying fully with the policy compared with 44.2% of respondents in zones with the partial lockdown. Market places, classified as high-risk zones, were the most visited (n = 505; 71.0%). Though compliance was influenced by the nature of lockdown enforced (chi (2) = 70.385, df = 2; p < 0.05), being a female, a widow, and unemployed were associated with increased compliance. Exposure to COVID-19 was associated with being married, unemployed, and having no income. Fear, anxiety, and misperception play major roles in compliance. The authors conclude that compliance is not uniform and a more nuanced and targeted approach is required as the government continues to respond to the COVID-19 global pandemic.	Prevention
34200380	Methodology for Addressing Infectious Aerosol Persistence in Real-Time Using Sensor Network. Human exposure to infectious aerosols results in the transmission of diseases such as influenza, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. Most dental procedures generate a significant number of aerosolized particles, increasing transmission risk in dental settings. Since the generation of aerosols in dentistry is unavoidable, many clinics have started using intervention strategies such as area-filtration units and extraoral evacuation equipment, especially under the relatively recent constraints of the pandemic. However, the effectiveness of these devices in dental operatories has not been studied. Therefore, the ability of dental personnel to efficiently position and operate such instruments is also limited. To address these challenges, we utilized a real-time sensor network for assessment of aerosol dynamics during dental restoration and cleaning producers with and without intervention. The strategies tested during the procedures were (i) local area High-Efficiency Particle Air (HEPA) filters and (ii) Extra-Oral Suction Device (EOSD). The study was conducted at the University of Washington School of Dentistry using a network of 13 fixed sensors positioned within the operatory and one wearable sensor worn by the dental operator. The sensor network provides time and space-resolved particulate matter (PM) data. Three-dimensional (3D) visualization informed aerosol persistence in the operatory. It was found that area filters did not improve the overall aerosol concentration in dental offices in a significant way. A decrease in PM concentration by an average of 16% was observed when EOSD equipment was used during the procedures. The combination of real-time sensors and 3D visualization can provide dental personnel and facility managers with actionable feedback to effectively assess aerosol transmission in medical settings and develop evidence-based intervention strategies.

34205975	Multifaced Roles of HDL in Sepsis and SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Renal Implications. High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are a class of blood particles, principally involved in mediating reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissue to liver. Omics approaches have identified crucial mediators in the HDL proteomic and lipidomic profile, which are involved in distinct pleiotropic functions. Besides their role as cholesterol transporter, HDLs display anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-thrombotic, and anti-infection properties. Experimental and clinical studies have unveiled significant changes in both HDL serum amount and composition that lead to dysregulated host immune response and endothelial dysfunction in the course of sepsis. Most SARS-Coronavirus-2-infected patients admitted to the intensive care unit showed common features of sepsis disease, such as the overwhelmed systemic inflammatory response and the alterations in serum lipid profile. Despite relevant advances, episodes of mild to moderate acute kidney injury (AKI), occurring during systemic inflammatory diseases, are associated with long-term complications, and high risk of mortality. The multi-faceted relationship of kidney dysfunction with dyslipidemia and inflammation encourages to deepen the clarification of the mechanisms connecting these elements. This review analyzes the multifaced roles of HDL in inflammatory diseases, the renal involvement in lipid metabolism, and the novel potential HDL-based therapies.	Mechanism;Treatment
34282223	Association between heavy metals, high-sensitivity C-reaction protein and 10-year risk of cardiovascular diseases among adult Korean population. The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in Korea tends to be increasing. It has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing evidence shows heavy metals are associated with increased CVD risk. We aimed to determine the association between the serum heavy metal levels and 10-year risk of CVDs and to predict risks of CVDs based on marginal effects. Heavy metals were measured by a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and direct mercury analyzer. The results show a significant relationship between the increase in cadmium, lead, mercury, hs-CRP levels and the 10-year risk of CVD after adjustment for serum cotinine, age group, sex, body mass index, a family history of CVDs, diabetes or hyperlipidemia, high-risk drinking, physical activity, and diabetes. A doubling of serum cadmium, lead, mercury, and hs-CRP was associated with the increase in the 10-year risk of CVD by 0.14%, 0.10%, 0.11% and 0.22%, respectively. Therefore, a special concern should be given to the harmful impacts of heavy metals on the 10-year risk of CVD. It is important to develop a prevention strategy targeting the high-risk population to slow down this progression to risk factors related to heavy metals and reduce prevalence. Remarkedly, hs-CRP is the most validated and widely used inflammatory marker, and could be a potential clinical value in predicting and monitoring CVDs.	Prevention
34199283	Ruthenium Complexes in the Fight against Pathogenic Microorganisms. An Extensive Review. The widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in the emergence of drug-resistant populations of microorganisms. Clearly, one can see the need to develop new, more effective, antimicrobial agents that go beyond the explored 'chemical space'. In this regard, their unique modes of action (e.g., reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, redox activation, ligand exchange, depletion of substrates involved in vital cellular processes) render metal complexes as promising drug candidates. Several Ru (II/III) complexes have been included in, or are currently undergoing, clinical trials as anticancer agents. Based on the in-depth knowledge of their chemical properties and biological behavior, the interest in developing new ruthenium compounds as antibiotic, antifungal, antiparasitic, or antiviral drugs has risen. This review will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Ru (II/III) frameworks as antimicrobial agents. Some aspects regarding the relationship between their chemical structure and mechanism of action, cellular localization, and/or metabolism of the ruthenium complexes in bacterial and eukaryotic cells are discussed as well. Regarding the antiviral activity, in light of current events related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ru (II/III) compounds used against SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., BOLD-100) are also reviewed herein.

34364072	A case of secondary sclerosing cholangitis due to COVID-19. COVID-19 was first recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in December 2019 and declared a global pandemic in March 2020. Although COVID-19 primarily results in pulmonary symptoms, it is becoming apparent that it can lead to multisystemic manifestations. Liver damage with elevated AST and ALT is seen in patients with COVID-19. Although the etiology of liver damage is still debated, biliary damage is rarely seen. This case demonstrates a potential complication of COVID-19 in a previously healthy patient. The patient contracted COVID-19 in March 2020 and endured a complicated course including intubation, multiple readmissions, and chronic abdominal pain. He is now awaiting a liver transplant. Our case portrays biliary damage as an additional possible complication of COVID-19 and the importance of imaging in its diagnosis.	Case Report
34205262	The Role of Th17 Response in COVID-19. COVID-19 is an acute infectious disease of the respiratory system caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2). Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections occurs through droplets and contaminated objects. A rapid and well-coordinated immune system response is the first line of defense in a viral infection. However, a disturbed and over-activated immune response may be counterproductive, causing damage to the body. Severely ill patients hospitalised with COVID-19 exhibit increased levels of many cytokines, including Interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Increasing evidence suggests that Th17 cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, not only by activating cytokine cascade but also by inducing Th2 responses, inhibiting Th1 differentiation and suppressing Treg cells. This review focuses on a Th17 pathway in the course of the immune response in COVID-19, and explores plausible targets for therapeutic intervention.	Mechanism;Treatment
34209271	Eating Habits during the COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy: The Nutritional and Lifestyle Side Effects of the Pandemic. To limit the spread of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a nationwide lockdown started in Italy in March 2020. In this unpredictable situation, a cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire was carried out by the Observatory on Food Surplus, Recovery and Waste of CREA Food and Nutrition Centre. The aim of this work was to evaluate how Italian habits changed during this period, the determinants of changes, and the effect on food waste prevention. In a sample of 2678 respondents, 62% showed low Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (AMD). During lockdown many of participants improved the quality of their diet, increasing their consumption of fruit (24.4%), vegetables (28.5%), legumes (22.1%), nuts (12%), and fish or shellfish (14%). Unfavorable changes were observed with the excessive consumption of sweets or pastries (36.9%) and comfort foods (22.7%), and a lack of physical activity (37.2%). The main novelty of this study was the examination of dietary changes identified by a cluster analysis. Respondents with generally high AMD improved their eating habits, while the habits of the respondents with generally low AMD remained unchanged. In addition, nearly 80% of respondents were sensitive to food waste. The study provides a useful contribution to the debate on nutritional recommendations in case of further lockdown.	Prevention
34226885	Implementation of warfarin to direct oral anticoagulant conversion initiative in pharmacist-run anticoagulation clinics during COVID-19 pandemic. Due to community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), social distancing and stay-at-home orders were implemented statewide in an effort to limit the spread of disease. This posed unique challenges for patients on medications requiring close and continued monitoring by clinic staff, such as anticoagulation clinics. Thus, innovative measures were implemented at Cleveland Clinic Health System (CCHS) to maintain the health and care of ambulatory patients. An initiative to evaluate patients for warfarin to direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) conversion was used in the pharmacist-run anticoagulation clinics. This article describes how patients were screened for eligibility, the education to pharmacists, the utilization of student learners in the process, and the workflow for provider notification of conversion.

34377775	"Changes in Patient Satisfaction Scores During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a rapid and widespread application of telemedicine services in the outpatient setting. Prior to COVID-19, patient satisfaction was measured with Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Clinician & Group Survey (CG-CAHPS) and was then measured with the Press Ganey telemedicine survey. Both surveys ask about a patient's likelihood to recommend a particular medical practice, which is a useful, but imperfect, surrogate for overall satisfaction. The purpose of this analysis was to identify any changes in patient satisfaction scores with the implementation of telemedicine services. A retrospective analysis of our institution's experience during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the months immediately prior to the pandemic was conducted. The percent of patients with a ""Top box"" response to survey questions regarding their likelihood to recommend a medical practice were compared. A total of 14 430 CG-CAHPS results collected in November 2019 through February 2020 were compared to 22 009 telemedicine survey results collected between March and May 2020. In general, most medical specialties incorporated telemedicine but suffered a decrease in their patient's likelihood to recommend a medical practice during the first few months of the pandemic. However, the magnitude of this decrease was variable by medical specialty. Physical medicine and rehabilitation and pain medicine had relatively poor scores prior to the pandemic which did not statistically change. Oncology was the sole medical specialty that continued to have unchanged high patient satisfaction scores. These data provide insights for the refinement of telemedicine."	Prevention
34339626	Post-viral effects of COVID-19 in the olfactory system and their implications. BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which any upper respiratory virus, including SARS-CoV-2, impairs chemosensory function are not known. COVID-19 is frequently associated with olfactory dysfunction after viral infection, which provides a research opportunity to evaluate the natural course of this neurological finding. Clinical trials and prospective and histological studies of new-onset post-viral olfactory dysfunction have been limited by small sample sizes and a paucity of advanced neuroimaging data and neuropathological samples. Although data from neuropathological specimens are now available, neuroimaging of the olfactory system during the acute phase of infection is still rare due to infection control concerns and critical illness and represents a substantial gap in knowledge. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: The active replication of SARS-CoV-2 within the brain parenchyma (ie, in neurons and glia) has not been proven. Nevertheless, post-viral olfactory dysfunction can be viewed as a focal neurological deficit in patients with COVID-19. Evidence is also sparse for a direct causal relation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and abnormal brain findings at autopsy, and for trans-synaptic spread of the virus from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb. Taken together, clinical, radiological, histological, ultrastructural, and molecular data implicate inflammation, with or without infection, in either the olfactory epithelium, the olfactory bulb, or both. This inflammation leads to persistent olfactory deficits in a subset of people who have recovered from COVID-19. Neuroimaging has revealed localised inflammation in intracranial olfactory structures. To date, histopathological, ultrastructural, and molecular evidence does not suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is an obligate neuropathogen. WHERE NEXT?: The prevalence of CNS and olfactory bulb pathosis in patients with COVID-19 is not known. We postulate that, in people who have recovered from COVID-19, a chronic, recrudescent, or permanent olfactory deficit could be prognostic for an increased likelihood of neurological sequelae or neurodegenerative disorders in the long term. An inflammatory stimulus from the nasal olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulbs and connected brain regions might accelerate pathological processes and symptomatic progression of neurodegenerative disease. Persistent olfactory impairment with or without perceptual distortions (ie, parosmias or phantosmias) after SARS-CoV-2 infection could, therefore, serve as a marker to identify people with an increased long-term risk of neurological disease.

34362872	Phylogenomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from third wave clusters in Malaysia reveals dominant local lineage B.1.524 and persistent spike mutation A701V. The emergence of a third wave of COVID-19 infection in Malaysia since September 2020 has led to imminent changes in public health prevention and control measures. As high as 96.2% of registered COVID-19 cases and 88.5% of confirmed deaths in Malaysia occurred during this third wave of infection. A phylogenomic study on 258 SARS-CoV-2 full genomes from February 2020-February 2021 has led to the discovery of a novel Malaysian lineage B.1.524. This lineage contains another spike mutation A701V that co-exists with the D614G spike mutation that was predominant in most of the third-wave clusters. The study provides vital genomic insights on the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 variants in Malaysia in conjunction with the presence of a dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage during the third wave of COVID-19 infection.

34220496	The Impact of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System on Inflammation, Coagulation, and Atherothrombotic Complications, and to Aggravated COVID-19. Atherosclerosis is considered a disease caused by a chronic inflammation, associated with endothelial dysfunction, and several mediators of inflammation are up-regulated in subjects with atherosclerotic disease. Healthy, intact endothelium exhibits an antithrombotic, protective surface between the vascular lumen and vascular smooth muscle cells in the vessel wall. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between anti- and prooxidants, with a subsequent increase of reactive oxygen species, leading to tissue damage. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is of vital importance in the pathobiology of vascular disease. Convincing data indicate that angiotensin II accelerates hypertension and augments the production of reactive oxygen species. This leads to the generation of a proinflammatory phenotype in human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells by the up-regulation of adhesion molecules, chemokines and cytokines. In addition, angiotensin II also seems to increase thrombin generation, possibly via a direct impact on tissue factor. However, the mechanism of cross-talk between inflammation and haemostasis can also contribute to prothrombotic states in inflammatory environments. Thus, blocking of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might be an approach to reduce both inflammatory and thrombotic complications in high-risk patients. During COVID-19, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may be activated. The levels of angiotensin II could contribute to the ongoing inflammation, which might result in a cytokine storm, a complication that significantly impairs prognosis. At the outbreak of COVID-19 concerns were raised about the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker drugs in patients with COVID-19 and hypertension or other cardiovascular comorbidities. However, the present evidence is in favor of continuing to use of these drugs. Based on experimental evidence, blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might even exert a potentially protective influence in the setting of COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34203185	Significant Decrease in Annual Cancer Diagnoses in Spain during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Real-Data Study. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a profound change in health organizations at both the primary and hospital care levels. This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the annual rate of new cancer diagnosis in two university-affiliated hospitals. This study includes all the patients with a pathological diagnosis of cancer attended in two hospitals in Malaga (Spain) during the first year of pandemic. This study population was compared with the patients diagnosed during the previous year 2019. To analyze whether the possible differences in the annual rate of diagnoses were due to the pandemic or to other causes, the patients diagnosed during 2018 and 2017 were also compared. There were 2340 new cancer diagnosis compared to 2825 patients in 2019 which represented a decrease of -17.2% (p = 0.0001). Differences in the number of cancer patients diagnosed between 2018 and 2019 (2840 new cases; 0.5% increase) or 2017 and 2019 (2909 new cases; 3% increase) were not statistically significant. The highest number of patients lost from diagnosis in 2020 was in breast cancer (-26.1%), colorectal neoplasms (-16.9%), and head and neck tumors (-19.8%). The study of incidence rates throughout the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic shows that the diagnosis of new cancer patients has been significantly impaired. Health systems must take the necessary measures to restore pre-pandemic diagnostic procedures and to recover lost patients who have not been diagnosed.	Prevention
34213801	Does chronic inflammation cause acute inflammation to spiral into hyper-inflammation in a manner modulated by diet and the gut microbiome, in severe Covid-19? We propose that hyper-inflammation (HYPi) is a ''runaway'' consequence of acute inflammation (ACUi) that arises more easily (and also abates less easily) in those who host a pre-existing chronic inflammation (CHRi), because (i) most factors involved in generating an ACUi to limit viral proliferation are already present when there is an underlying CHRi, and also because (ii) anti-inflammatory (AI) mechanisms for the abatement of ACUi (following containment of viral proliferation) are suppressed and desensitized where there is an underlying CHRi, with this causing the ACUi to spiral into a HYPi. Stress, pollution, diet, and gut microbiomes (alterable in weeks through dietary changes) have an intimate and bidirectional cause-effect relationship with CHRi. We propose that avoidance of CHRi-promoting foods and adoption of CHRi-suppressing foods could reduce susceptibility to HYPi, in Covid-19 and in other viral diseases, such as influenza, which are characterized by episodic and unpredictable HYPi.

34289923	Counting Pandemic Statistics Remotely Using Webcams. OBJECTIVE: Lack of mask use during large public events might spread COVID-19. It is possible now to measure this and similar public health information using publicly available webcams. We demonstrate a rapid assessment approach for measuring mask usage at a public event. METHOD: We monitored crowds at public areas in Sturgis, SD using a live, high-definition, town-sponsored video stream to analyze the prevalence of mask wearing. We developed a rapid coding procedure for mask wearing and analyzed brief (5 to 25 min) video segments to assess mask-wearing compliance in outdoor public areas. We calculated compliance estimates and compared reliability among the human coders. RESULTS: We were able to observe and quantify public behavior on the public streets. This approach rapidly estimated public health information (e.g., 512 people observed over 25 minutes with 2.3% mask usage) available on the same day. Coders produced reliable estimates across a sample of videos for counting masked users and mask-wearing proportion. Our video data is stored in Databrary.org. CONCLUSIONS: This approach has implications for disaster responses and public health. The approach is easy to use, can provide same day results, and can provide public health stakeholders with key information on public behavior.	Prevention
34342366	Comparability of six different immunoassays measuring SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with neutralising antibody levels in convalescent plasma: from utility to prediction. BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy for COVID-19 provides virus neutralising antibodies that may ameliorate the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The effectiveness of CP likely depends on its antiviral neutralising potency and is determined using in vitro neutralising antibody assays. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated abilities of three immunoassays for anti-spike antibodies (EUROimmun, Ortho, Roche), a pseudotype-based neutralisation assay and two assays that quantify ACE2 binding of spike protein (GenScript and haemagglutination-based HAT assay) to predict neutralising antibody titres in 113 convalescent plasma donations. Assay outputs were analysed through linear regression and calculation of sensitivities and specificities by ROC analysis. RESULTS: Median values of plasma samples containing neutralising antibodies produced conversion factors for assay unitage of x6.5 (pseudotype), x19 (GenScript), x3.4 (HAT assay), x0.08 (EUROimmun), x1.64 (Roche) and x0.10 (Ortho). All selected assays were sufficient in identifying the high titre donations based on ROC analysis; area over curve ranged from 91.7% for HAT and GenScript assay to 95.6% for pseudotype assay. However, their ability to predict the actual neutralising antibody levels varied substantially as shown by linear regression correlation values (from 0.27 for Ortho to 0.61 for pseudotype assay). DISCUSSION: Combined, the study data demonstrates that all selected assays were effective in identifying donations with high neutralising antibody levels and are potentially suitable as surrogate assays for donation selection for convalescent plasma therapy.

34283832	Spatially resolved simulations of the spread of COVID-19 in three European countries. We explore the spatial and temporal spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus under containment measures in three European countries based on fits to data of the early outbreak. Using data from Spain and Italy, we estimate an age dependent infection fatality ratio for SARS-CoV-2, as well as risks of hospitalization and intensive care admission. We use them in a model that simulates the dynamics of the virus using an age structured, spatially detailed agent based approach, that explicitly incorporates governmental interventions and changes in mobility and contact patterns occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak in each country. Our simulations reproduce several of the features of its spatio-temporal spread in the three countries studied. They show that containment measures combined with high density are responsible for the containment of cases within densely populated areas, and that spread to less densely populated areas occurred during the late stages of the first wave. The capability to reproduce observed features of the spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 makes this model a potential candidate for forecasting the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in other settings, and we recommend its application in low and lower-middle income countries which remain understudied.

34220705	Could Exogenous Insulin Ameliorate the Metabolic Dysfunction Induced by Glucocorticoids and COVID-19? The finding that high-dose dexamethasone improves survival in those requiring critical care due to COVID-19 will mean much greater usage of glucocorticoids in the subsequent waves of coronavirus infection. Furthermore, the consistent finding of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 in individuals with obesity, hypertension and diabetes has focussed attention on the metabolic dysfunction that may arise with critical illness. The SARS coronavirus itself may promote relative insulin deficiency, ketogenesis and hyperglycaemia in susceptible individuals. In conjunction with prolonged critical care, these components will promote a catabolic state. Insulin infusion is the mainstay of therapy for treatment of hyperglycaemia in acute illness but what is the effect of insulin on the admixture of glucocorticoids and COVID-19? This article reviews the evidence for the effect of insulin on clinical outcomes and intermediary metabolism in critical illness.	Treatment
34203647	Progression and Trends in Virus from Influenza A to COVID-19: An Overview of Recent Studies. Influenza is a highly known contagious viral infection that has been responsible for the death of many people in history with pandemics. These pandemics have been occurring every 10 to 30 years in the last century. The most recent global pandemic prior to COVID-19 was the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. A decade ago, the H1N1 virus caused 12,500 deaths in just 19 months globally. Now, again, the world has been challenged with another pandemic. Since December 2019, the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection was detected in Wuhan. This infection has risen rapidly throughout the world; even the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a worldwide emergency to ensure human health and public safety. This review article aims to discuss important issues relating to COVID-19, including clinical, epidemiological, and pathological features of COVID-19 and recent progress in diagnosis and treatment approaches for the COVID-19 infection. We also highlight key similarities and differences between COVID-19 and influenza A to ensure the theoretical and practical details of COVID-19.	Diagnosis;Mechanism;Treatment
34292110	Communicable Illness Mitigation Strategies for Traveling Elite Sporting Organizations. CONTEXT: Transmission of communicable diseases observed in sporting organizations is often preventable. Early detection, isolation, and treatment can significantly diminish time lost. Until recently, there has been a paucity of standardized guidelines outlining feasible, preventable measures to protect both athletes and staff from contagious illnesses. Therefore, the purpose of this narrative was to highlight optimal prevention practices for transmission mitigation, with a particular focus on hygiene activity and travel considerations in professional sporting organizations. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and peer-reviewed journals. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 5. RESULTS: Communicable illness prevention strategies begin at the level of sufficient personal hygiene practices. Common area surface cleaning recommendations, including shared equipment sanitization between usage as well as designated equipment use to specific athletes, should be considered to minimize cross-contamination, in particular, for liked-position players. Intelligent design for shared areas can include redistributing the layout of communal spaces, most feasibly, spreading locker designation a minimum distance of 6 ft from one another. Travel considerations can include placing most susceptible passengers closest to window seating, boarding last and exiting first. Team physicians should have knowledge of essential personnel medical histories in an effort to risk stratify staff members and players in the setting of communicable disease. CONCLUSION: Providing a framework for illness management and prevention is important when considering the effects on player health, missed time, performance, and overall cost. Containment of commonly observed communicable illnesses can be optimized with sufficient personal hygiene practices, common area surface cleaning recommendations, intelligent design for shared areas, travel and hotel considerations, as well as appropriate screening tools and isolation techniques.

34217435	Telehealth in Multidisciplinary Target Delineation for Radiotherapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic. A Review and a Case. Like all other medical specialties, radiotherapy has been deeply influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had severe influence on the entire patient trajectory in oncology, from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up. Many examples of how to deal with patient and staff safety, shortness of staff and other resources and the quest to continue high-quality, evidence-based treatment have been presented. The use of telemedicine and telehealth is frequently presented as a part of the solution to overcome these challenges. Some of the available presented solutions will only apply in an acute, local setting, whereas others might inspire the community to improve quality and cost-effectiveness of radiotherapy as well as knowledge sharing in the future. Some of the unresolved issues in many of the available technical solutions are related to data security and public regulation, for example, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in the EU and HIPAA compliance (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the USA. Using a solution that involves a supplier's server in a non-EU country is problematic within the EU. In this paper we shortly review the influence of COVID-19 on radiotherapy. We describe some of the possible solutions for telehealth in target delineation - a crucial part of high-quality radiotherapy, which often requires multidisciplinary effort, hands-on corporation, and high-quality multimodal imaging. Hereafter, our own technical solution will be presented as a case.	Prevention
34206211	Rhamnolipids Nano-Micelles as a Potential Hand Sanitizer. COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2, which continues to cause global health and economic problems since emerging in China in late 2019. Until now, there are no standard antiviral treatments. Thus, several strategies were adopted to minimize virus transmission, such as social distancing, face covering protection and hand hygiene. Rhamnolipids are glycolipids produced formally by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and as biosurfactants, they were shown to have broad antimicrobial activity. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of rhamnolipids against selected multidrug resistant bacteria and SARS-CoV-2. Rhamnolipids were produced by growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain LeS3 in a new medium formulated from chicken carcass soup. The isolated rhamnolipids were characterized for their molecular composition, formulated into nano-micelles, and the antibacterial activity of the nano-micelles was demonstrated in vitro against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive drug resistant bacteria. In silico studies docking rhamnolipids to structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 was also performed. We demonstrated the efficient and specific interaction of rhamnolipids with the active sites of these proteins. Additionally, the computational studies suggested that rhamnolipids have membrane permeability activity. Thus, the obtained results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be another target of rhamnolipids and could find utility in the fight against COVID-19, a future perspective to be considered.

34223137	Antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infection in patients with suspected and proven COVID-19: results from an antibiotic point prevalence survey in Scottish hospitals. Background: Bacterial co-infection is infrequently observed with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection outside of critical care, however, antibiotics are commonly prescribed. Objectives: To examine factors associated with antibiotic prescribing for suspected respiratory tract infection (RTI) and evaluate the nature and dynamics of prescribing in hospitalized patients with suspected and proven COVID-19 infection. Methods: An antibiotic point prevalence survey in hospitalized adult patients was conducted in designated COVID-19 clinical areas (including critical care) in 15 Scottish hospitals. Antibiotics prescribed for RTI and factors associated with prescribing were investigated. Results: Of 820 surveyed patients, 272 (prevalence 33.3%) received antibiotics for suspected RTI on the survey day and 58.8% were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Antibiotics were empirical in 91.9% and amoxicillin (24.6%), doxycycline (20.5%) and co-amoxiclav (15%) were most frequently prescribed. Oral antibiotics were prescribed in 54.5% and duration was recorded in 76.7% on wards for a median of 5 days. IV to oral switch occurred after a median of 2 days. Prescribing for RTI was independently and positively associated with COPD/chronic lung disease, purulent/bloody sputum, abnormal chest X-ray, and CRP >/= 100 mg/L. Probable and definite hospital-acquired COVID-19 and diabetes were associated with a lower odds of receiving an antibiotic for RTI. Conclusions: Antibiotic prescribing for suspected RTI was commonly observed and predominantly empirical in suspected or proven COVID-19. Initiatives to reinforce stewardship principles including clinical review, effective use of microbiological diagnostics and better understanding of the role of biomarkers are central to further limit unnecessary antibiotic therapy in COVID-19.

34204934	Characteristics and Survival of Intensive Care Unit Patients with Coronavirus Disease in Osaka, Japan: A Retrospective Observational Study. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) have not been adequately evaluated in Japan. We analyzed the registry data of 205 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU between February and November 2020, in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association between epidemiological factors and mortality among ICU patients. Of the 205 ICU patients, 161 (78.5%) were men and 149 (72.7%) were older than 60 years. A total of 117 patients (57.1%) had comorbidities. The most common symptoms at diagnosis were mild (n = 131, 63.9%). A total of 187 patients (91.2%) received mechanical ventilation, and 32 patients (15.6%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Patients were followed up for a median of 25 days after ICU admission. A total of 147 patients (71.7%) were alive at discharge, and 58 patients (28.3%) died. The hazard ratio for mortality among patients aged >80 years was 6.02 (95% confidence interval: 2.10-17.25) in the multivariable model, which was higher than that among those aged </=59 years. These results are useful for recognizing the clinical course of this infection in ICU patients.	Diagnosis;Treatment
34205119	Social Distancing, Lockdown and the Wide Use of Mask; A Magic Solution or a Double-Edged Sword for Respiratory Viruses Epidemiology? The use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing, lockdowns and the massive use of masks, have not only largely prevented the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but also of other respiratory viruses such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This decrease has been so high that, in most countries, the influenza and RSV epidemic has not occurred. Far from being a beneficial fact, this can be problematic, since the absence of circulation of certain pathogens can lead to a decrease in herd immunity against them. This can promote the rise of more serious, longer-lasting epidemics that start sooner. To alleviate the collateral effects that may occur due to the decrease in circulation of viruses such as influenza, it is necessary to increase the production of influenza vaccines, carry out mass vaccination campaigns and focus on vaccinating the main drivers of this virus, children.

34375702	Occupational COVID-19 Exposures and Secondary Cases among Healthcare Personnel. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare personnel (HCP) have been at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, both from patients and co-workers. This paper summarizes occupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2 and secondary cases among HCP at a large health system. Key findings indicate that transmission of COVID-19 to HCP is low, especially with close adherence to PPE guidelines, but lapses in infection prevention practices, including dining together and omitting eye protection during patient care, especially at times when COVID-19 is circulating widely in the community increase the risk of exposure and subsequent transmission to HCP.

34204014	Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers Withdrawal Is Associated with Higher Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19. Our main aim was to describe the effect on the severity of ACEI (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) and ARB (angiotensin II receptor blocker) during COVID-19 hospitalization. A retrospective, observational, multicenter study evaluating hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with ACEI/ARB. The primary endpoint was the incidence of the composite outcome of prognosis (IMV (invasive mechanical ventilation), NIMV (non-invasive mechanical ventilation), ICU admission (intensive care unit), and/or all-cause mortality). We evaluated both outcomes in patients whose treatment with ACEI/ARB was continued or withdrawn. Between February and June 2020, 11,205 patients were included, mean age 67 years (SD = 16.3) and 43.1% female; 2162 patients received ACEI/ARB treatment. ACEI/ARB treatment showed lower all-cause mortality (p < 0.0001). Hypertensive patients in the ACEI/ARB group had better results in IMV, ICU admission, and the composite outcome of prognosis (p < 0.0001 for all). No differences were found in the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events. Patients previously treated with ACEI/ARB continuing treatment during hospitalization had a lower incidence of the composite outcome of prognosis than those whose treatment was withdrawn (RR 0.67, 95%CI 0.63-0.76). ARB was associated with better survival than ACEI (HR 0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.96). ACEI/ARB treatment during COVID-19 hospitalization was associated with protection on mortality. The benefits were greater in hypertensive, those who continued treatment, and those taking ARB.	Mechanism;Treatment
34352870	Hemorrhagic stroke associated to COVID-19 infection in Mexico General Hospital. INTRODUCCION: en la actual pandemia de COVID-19, existe evidencia creciente que ha identificado el neurotropismo del virus SARS-CoV-2 y sus complicaciones neurologicas, incluida la enfermedad cerebrovascular isquemica y escasamente hemorragia cerebral (HC). OBJETIVO: describir las caracteristicas clinicas, radiologicas, de laboratorio y pronosticas de los pacientes con HC asociada al SARS-CoV-2. METODOS: se incluyeron pacientes consecutivos con prueba de PCR confirmatoria para infeccion por SARS-CoV-2 y HC. RESULTADOS: en un periodo de 90 dias, en un centro de referencia COVID-19 en Mexico, de 1108 pacientes con infeccion por SARS-CoV-2, se encontraron 4 pacientes (0.36%) con HC. Tenian una edad de 71(+/-12.2) anos, 2 eran mujeres. Se encontro que dos tenian factores de riesgo cardiovascular previos. En dos casos se encontro el origen en el nucleo dentado mientras que los otros dos correspondieron al talamo. Tres de los cuatro pacientes murieron. Postulamos que el descontrol hipertensivo, coagulopatia, trombocitopenia y la respuesta inmune inducida por el virus SARS-CoV-2 podrian desencadenar HC en un paciente con riesgo previo. CONCLUSIONES: la HC se asocia a la infeccion por SARS-CoV-2 con mal pronostico cuando se presenta. Los equipos de neurocirugia deben estar preparados para el tratamiento oportuno de estos pacientes. INTRODUCTION: In the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing body of evidence that has identified the neurotropism of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its neurological complications, including cerebrovascular disease, focusing mainly in ischemic and scarcely about hemorrhagic stroke (HS). OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to describe clinical, radiological, laboratory tests, and prognostic characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 associated HS. METHODS: Consecutive patients with a confirmatory PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection and a HS demonstrated by head CT were included in the study. RESULTS: Over a period of 90 days, in a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico, out of a total of 1108 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, it found 4 patients (0.36%) who meet criteria. They had an age of 71 (+/-12.2) years, 2 were women. It was found that two had prior cardiovascular risk factors. Two of the HS originated in the dentate nucleus while the other two corresponded to the thalamus. Three of the four patients died. We suggest that catastrophic uncontrolled blood pressure, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 could in a specific patient trigger HS. CONCLUSIONS: HS is associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection with poor prognosis when it presented. Neurosurgery teams should prepare for the timely and appropriate treatment of this patients.	Case Report
34201214	SARS-CoV-2 Entry: At the Crossroads of CD147 and ACE2. In late 2019, the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the viral agent responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Coronaviruses Spike proteins are responsible for their ability to interact with host membrane receptors and different proteins have been identified as SARS-CoV-2 interactors, among which Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and Basigin2/EMMPRIN/CD147 (CD147). CD147 plays an important role in human immunodeficiency virus type 1, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections. In particular, SARS-CoV recognizes the CD147 receptor expressed on the surface of host cells by its nucleocapsid protein binding to cyclophilin A (CyPA), a ligand for CD147. However, the involvement of CD147 in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still debated. Interference with both the function (blocking antibody) and the expression (knock down) of CD147 showed that this receptor partakes in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provided additional clues on the underlying mechanism: CD147 binding to CyPA does not play a role; CD147 regulates ACE2 levels and both receptors are affected by virus infection. Altogether, these findings suggest that CD147 is involved in SARS-CoV-2 tropism and represents a possible therapeutic target to challenge COVID-19.	Mechanism;Treatment
34287098	A systematic review on efficacy, safety, and treatment-durability of low-dose rituximab for the treatment of Pemphigus: special focus on COVID-19 pandemic concerns. BACKGROUND: Rituximab is a FDA-approved monoclonal antibody for adults with moderate to severe potentially life-threatening pemphigus vulgaris. Recent studies have focused on assessments of efficacy and safety of low-dose rituximab (<2 gram in each cycle). METHOD: Databases were searched from 2010 to 2020 (last update: 1 June 2020). RESULT: Nine studies were entered; including180 cases (92: women, 88: men, age range: 9-83 years). The dosages of each Rituximab cycle varied between ultra-low-dose (</=500 mg for a cycle, either multiple infusions or a single infusion), low-dose (2 x 375 mg/m(2) or 2 x 500 mg) and modified-dose (3 x 375 mg/m(2) or 3 x 500 mg). The efficacy and safety of Rituximab in the studies are known by the recovery time, relapse time, and side events. According to the studies, 2 x 500 can lead to complete remission in a broad range, from 35 to 82%. These differences might be explained by different end-points and variable cumulative corticosteroid dosage after RTX administration. Although the studies showed that low dose RTX is efficient, there are some controversies regarding the choosing low-dose for severe patients. CONCLUSION: Considering the effectiveness of low-dose, intermediate dose, and ultra-low-dose protocols of Rituximab in inducing remission in pemphigus disease and considering factors such as cost of therapy, and the need to induce a minimum of immunosuppression for a minimum duration in the COVID-19 pandemic, suggested to use low-dose Rituximab protocol (2 infusions of 500 mg Rituximab: interval of 2 weeks) to induce the remission in mild-to-moderate pemphigus patients.

34336564	Second wave of COVID-19 in Italy: Preliminary estimation of reproduction number and cumulative case projections. The second wave of a novel coronavirus in Italy has caused 247,369 new cases and 1782 deaths only in October 2020. This significantly alarming infectious disease controlling board to impose again mitigation measures for controlling the epidemic growth. In this paper, we estimate the latest COVID-19 reproduction number (R_0) and project the epidemic size for the future 45 days. The R_0 value has calculated as 2.83 (95% CI: 1.5-4.2) and the cumulative incidences 100,015 (95% CI; 73,201-100,352), and daily incidences might be reached up to 15,012 (95% CI: 8234-16,197) respectively.

34291025	Exploring Feasibility of Multivariate Deep Learning Models in Predicting COVID-19 Epidemic. Background: Mathematical models are powerful tools to study COVID-19. However, one fundamental challenge in current modeling approaches is the lack of accurate and comprehensive data. Complex epidemiological systems such as COVID-19 are especially challenging to the commonly used mechanistic model when our understanding of this pandemic rapidly refreshes. Objective: We aim to develop a data-driven workflow to extract, process, and develop deep learning (DL) methods to model the COVID-19 epidemic. We provide an alternative modeling approach to complement the current mechanistic modeling paradigm. Method: We extensively searched, extracted, and annotated relevant datasets from over 60 official press releases in Hubei, China, in 2020. Multivariate long short-term memory (LSTM) models were developed with different architectures to track and predict multivariate COVID-19 time series for 1, 2, and 3 days ahead. As a comparison, univariate LSTMs were also developed to track new cases, total cases, and new deaths. Results: A comprehensive dataset with 10 variables was retrieved and processed for 125 days in Hubei. Multivariate LSTM had reasonably good predictability on new deaths, hospitalization of both severe and critical patients, total discharges, and total monitored in hospital. Multivariate LSTM showed better results for new and total cases, and new deaths for 1-day-ahead prediction than univariate counterparts, but not for 2-day and 3-day-ahead predictions. Besides, more complex LSTM architecture seemed not to increase overall predictability in this study. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of DL models to complement current mechanistic approaches when the exact epidemiological mechanisms are still under investigation.

34226811	Modeling the spread of COVID-19 in New York City. This paper proposes an ensemble predictor for the weekly increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the city of New York at zip code level. Within a Bayesian model averaging framework, the baseline is a Poisson regression for count data. The set of covariates includes autoregressive terms, spatial effects, and demographic and socioeconomic variables. Our results for the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic show that these regressors are more significant to predict the number of new confirmed cases as the pandemic unfolds. Both pointwise and interval forecasts exhibit strong predictive ability in-sample and out-of-sample.	Epidemic Forecasting
34226779	Generalized form of fractional order COVID-19 model with Mittag-Leffler kernel. An important advantage of fractional derivatives is that we can formulate models describing much better systems with memory effects. Fractional operators with different memory are related to the different type of relaxation process of the nonlocal dynamical systems. Therefore, we investigate the COVID-19 model with the fractional derivatives in this paper. We apply very effective numerical methods to obtain the numerical results. We also use the Sumudu transform to get the solutions of the models. The Sumudu transform is able to keep the unit of the function, the parity of the function, and has many other properties that are more valuable. We present scientific results in the paper and also prove these results by effective numerical techniques which will be helpful to understand the outbreak of COVID-19.	Epidemic Forecasting
34226777	Improving the performance of deep learning models using statistical features: The case study of COVID-19 forecasting. COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of people's lives and disrupted the economy. Forecasting the number of cases infected with this virus can help authorities make accurate decisions on the interventions that must be implemented to control the pandemic. Investigation of the studies on COVID-19 forecasting indicates that various techniques such as statistical, mathematical, and machine and deep learning have been utilized. Although deep learning models have shown promising results in this context, their performance can be improved using auxiliary features. Therefore, in this study, we propose two hybrid deep learning methods that utilize the statistical features as auxiliary inputs and associate them with their main input. Specifically, we design a hybrid method of the multihead attention mechanism and the statistical features (ATT_FE) and a combined method of convolutional neural network and the statistical features (CNN_FE) and apply them to COVID-19 data of 10 countries with the highest number of confirmed cases. The results of experiments indicate that the hybrid models outperform their conventional counterparts in terms of performance measures. The experiments also demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid ATT_FE method over the long short-term memory model.	Epidemic Forecasting
34344318	Dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ireland under mitigation. BACKGROUND: In Ireland and across the European Union the COVID-19 epidemic waves, driven mainly by the emergence of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 have continued their course, despite various interventions from governments. Public health interventions continue in their attempts to control the spread as they wait for the planned significant effect of vaccination. METHODS: To tackle this challenge and the observed non-stationary aspect of the epidemic we used a modified SEIR stochastic model with time-varying parameters, following Brownian process. This enabled us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of COVID-19 with the non-specific hypothesis that it follows a basic stochastic process constrained by the available data. This model is coupled with Bayesian inference (particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method) for parameter estimation and utilized mainly well-documented Irish hospital data. RESULTS: In Ireland, mitigation measures provided a 78-86% reduction in transmission during the first wave between March and May 2020. For the second wave in October 2020, our reduction estimation was around 20% while it was 70% for the third wave in January 2021. This third wave was partly due to the UK variant appearing in Ireland. In June 2020 we estimated that sero-prevalence was 2.0% (95% CI: 1.2-3.5%) in complete accordance with a sero-prevalence survey. By the end of April 2021, the sero-prevalence was greater than 17% due in part to the vaccination campaign. Finally we demonstrate that the available observed confirmed cases are not reliable for analysis owing to the fact that their reporting rate has as expected greatly evolved. CONCLUSION: We provide the first estimations of the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ireland and its key parameters. We also quantify the effects of mitigation measures on the virus transmission during and after mitigation for the three waves. Our results demonstrate that Ireland has significantly reduced transmission by employing mitigation measures, physical distancing and lockdown. This has to date avoided the saturation of healthcare infrastructures, flattened the epidemic curve and likely reduced mortality. However, as we await for a full roll out of a vaccination programme and as new variants potentially more transmissible and/or more infectious could continue to emerge and mitigation measures change silent transmission, challenges remain.

34226649	A unifying nonlinear probabilistic epidemic model in space and time. Covid-19 epidemic dramatically relaunched the importance of mathematical modelling in supporting governments decisions to slow down the disease propagation. On the other hand, it remains a challenging task for mathematical modelling. The interplay between different models could be a key element in the modelling strategies. Here we propose a continuous space-time non-linear probabilistic model from which we can derive many of the existing models both deterministic and stochastic as for example SI, SIR, SIR stochastic, continuous-time stochastic models, discrete stochastic models, Fisher-Kolmogorov model. A partial analogy with the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics provides an interpretation of the model. Epidemic forecasting is one of its possible applications; in principle, the model can be used in order to locate those regions of space where the infection probability is going to increase. The connection between non-linear probabilistic and non-linear deterministic models is analyzed. In particular, it is shown that the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation is connected to linear probabilistic models. On the other hand, a generalized version of the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation is derived from the non-linear probabilistic model and is shown to be characterized by a non-homogeneous time-dependent diffusion coefficient (anomalous diffusion) which encodes information about the non-linearity of the probabilistic model.

In this article, we consider the problem of change-point analysis for the count time series data through an integer-valued autoregressive process of order 1 (INAR(1)) with time-varying covariates. These types of features we observe in many real-life scenarios especially in the COVID-19 data sets where the number of active cases over time starts falling and then again increases. In order to capture those features, we use Poisson INAR(1) process with a time-varying smoothing covariate. By using such model, we can model both the components in the active cases at time-point t namely - (i) number of non-recovery cases from the previous time-point, and (ii) number of new cases at time-point t. We study some theoretical properties of the proposed model along with forecasting. Some simulation studies are performed to study the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, we analyze two COVID-19 data sets and compare our proposed model to another PINAR(1) process which has time-varying covariate but no change-point, to demonstrate the overall performance of our proposed model.

34219967	Numerical simulation and stability analysis of a novel reaction-diffusion COVID-19 model. In this study, a novel reaction-diffusion model for the spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is investigated. The model is a spatial extension of the recent COVID-19 SEIR model with nonlinear incidence rates by taking into account the effects of random movements of individuals from different compartments in their environments. The equilibrium points of the new system are found for both diffusive and non-diffusive models, where a detailed stability analysis is conducted for them. Moreover, the stability regions in the space of parameters are attained for each equilibrium point for both cases of the model and the effects of parameters are explored. A numerical verification for the proposed model using a finite difference-based method is illustrated along with their consistency, stability and proving the positivity of the acquired solutions. The obtained results reveal that the random motion of individuals has significant impact on the observed dynamics and steady-state stability of the spread of the virus which helps in presenting some strategies for the better control of it.

34378235	A statistical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 infections and their case detection ratio in 2020. The case detection ratio of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections varies over time due to changing testing capacities, different testing strategies, and the evolving underlying number of infections itself. This note shows a way of quantifying these dynamics by jointly modeling the reported number of detected COVID-19 infections with nonfatal and fatal outcomes. The proposed methodology also allows to explore the temporal development of the actual number of infections, both detected and undetected, thereby shedding light on the infection dynamics. We exemplify our approach by analyzing German data from 2020, making only use of data available since the beginning of the pandemic. Our modeling approach can be used to quantify the effect of different testing strategies, visualize the dynamics in the case detection ratio over time, and obtain information about the underlying true infection numbers, thus enabling us to get a clearer picture of the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

34216468	Epidemiologic, immunologic, and virus characteristics in patients with paired SARS-CoV-2 serology and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. BACKGROUND: The natural history and clinical progression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections can be better understood using combined serological and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were collected at a single time-point from patients at an urban, public hospital August - November 2020 and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR, viral culture, and anti-Spike pan-Ig antibody testing. Participant demographics and symptoms were collected through interview. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to identify associations between RT-PCR and serology results with presence of viable virus and frequency of symptoms. RESULTS: Among 592 participants, 129 (21.8%) had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR or serology. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was strongly associated with lack of viable virus (p-value=0.016). COVID-19 symptom frequency was similar for patients testing RT-PCR positive/seronegative and patients testing RT-PCR positive/seropositive. Patients testing RT-PCR positive/seronegative reported headaches, fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting at rates not statistically significantly different from those testing RT-PCR negative/seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: While patients testing SARS-CoV-2 seropositive were unlikely to test positive for viable virus and were therefore low-risk for forward transmission, COVID-19 symptoms were common. Paired SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and antibody testing provides more nuanced understanding of patients' COVID-19 status.	Diagnosis;Transmission
34205133	Symptom and Age Homophilies in SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Networks during the Early Phase of the Pandemic in Japan. Kanagawa and Hokkaido were affected by COVID-19 in the early stage of the pandemic. Japan's initial response included contact tracing and PCR analysis on anyone who was suspected of having been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. In this retrospective study, we analyzed publicly available COVID-19 registry data from Kanagawa and Hokkaido (n = 4392). Exponential random graph model (ERGM) network analysis was performed to examine demographic and symptomological homophilies. Age, symptomatic, and asymptomatic status homophilies were seen in both prefectures. Symptom homophilies suggest that nuanced genetic differences in the virus may affect its epithelial cell type range and can result in the diversity of symptoms seen in individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2. Environmental variables such as temperature and humidity may also play a role in the overall pathogenesis of the virus. A higher level of asymptomatic transmission was observed in Kanagawa. Moreover, patients who contracted the virus through secondary or tertiary contacts were shown to be asymptomatic more frequently than those who contracted it from primary cases. Additionally, most of the transmissions stopped at the primary and secondary levels. As expected, significant viral transmission was seen in healthcare settings.	Transmission
34359111	Absence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Natural Environment Exposure in Sheep in Close Contact with Humans. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the zoonotic causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has caused a pandemic situation with millions of infected humans worldwide. Among domestic animals, there have been limited studies regarding the transmissibility and exposure to the infection in natural conditions. Some animals are exposed and/or susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as cats, ferrets and dogs. By contrast, there is no information about the susceptibility of ruminants to SARS-CoV-2. This study tested the antibody response in 90 ovine pre-pandemic serum samples and 336 sheep serum samples from the pandemic period (June 2020 to March 2021). In both cases, the animals were in close contact with a veterinary student community composed of more than 700 members. None of the serum samples analyzed was seroreactive based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike antigen. In this sense, no statistical difference was observed compared to the pre-pandemic sheep. Our results suggest that it seems unlikely that sheep could play a relevant role in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is the first study to report the absence of evidence of sheep exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in natural conditions.	Transmission
34209123	Investigation of Four Clusters of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Rwanda, 2020. We reported the findings of the first Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) four clusters identified in Rwanda. Case-investigations included contact elicitation, testing, and isolation/quarantine of confirmed cases. Socio-demographic and clinical data on cases and contacts were collected. A confirmed case was a person with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR) while a contact was any person who had contact with a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed case within 72 h prior, to 14 days after symptom onset; or 14 days before collection of the laboratory-positive sample for asymptomatic cases. High risk contacts were those who had come into unprotected face-to-face contact or had been in a closed environment with a SARS-CoV-2 case for >15 min. Forty cases were reported from four clusters by 22 April 2020, accounting for 61% of locally transmitted cases within six weeks. Clusters A, B, C and D were associated with two nightclubs, one house party, and different families or households living in the same compound (multi-family dwelling). Thirty-six of the 1035 contacts tested were positive (secondary attack rate: 3.5%). Positivity rates were highest among the high-risk contacts compared to low-risk contacts (10% vs. 2.2%). Index cases in three of the clusters were imported through international travelling. Fifteen of the 40 cases (38%) were asymptomatic while 13/25 (52%) and 8/25 (32%) of symptomatic cases had a cough and fever respectively. Gatherings in closed spaces were the main early drivers of transmission. Systematic case-investigations contact tracing and testing likely contributed to the early containment of SARS-CoV-2 in Rwanda.	Prevention;Transmission;Diagnosis
34226778	Analysis of transmission dynamics of COVID-19 via closed-form solutions of a susceptible-infectious-quarantined-diseased model with a quarantine-adjusted incidence function. We analyze the disease control and prevention strategies in a susceptible-infectious-quarantined-diseased (SIQD) model with a quarantine-adjusted incidence function. We have established the closed-form solutions for all the variables of SIQD model with a quarantine-adjusted incidence function provided beta not equal gamma + alpha by utilizing the classical techniques of solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The epidemic peak and time required to attain this peak are provided in closed form. We have provided closed-form expressions for force of infection and rate at which susceptible becomes infected. The management of epidemic perceptive using control and prevention strategies is explained as well. The epidemic starts when rho 0 > 1, the peak of epidemic appears when number of infected attains peak value when rho 0 = 1 , and the disease dies out rho 0 < 1. We have provided the comparison of estimated and actual epidemic peak of COVID-19 in Pakistan. The forecast of epidemic peak for the United states, Brazil, India, and the Syrian Arab Republic is given as well.	Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
34204885	SARS-CoV-2, a Threat to Marine Mammals? A Study from Italian Seawaters. Zoonotically transmitted coronaviruses were responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the dramatic Coronavirus Disease-2019 (CoViD-19) pandemic, which affected public health, the economy, and society on a global scale. The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic permeated into our environment and wildlife as well; in particular, concern has been raised about the viral occurrence and persistence in aquatic and marine ecosystems. The discharge of untreated wastewaters carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to sea mammals may have dramatic consequences on vulnerable species. The efficient transmission of coronaviruses raises questions regarding the contributions of virus-receptor interactions. The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), serving as a functional receptor for the viral spike (S) protein. This study aimed, through the comparative analysis of the ACE-2 receptor with the human one, at assessing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 for different species of marine mammals living in Italian waters. We also determined, by means of immunohistochemistry, ACE-2 receptor localization in the lung tissue from different cetacean species, in order to provide a preliminary characterization of ACE-2 expression in the marine mammal respiratory tracts. Furthermore, to evaluate if and how Italian wastewater management and coastal exposition to extreme weather events may led to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, geomapping data were carried out and overlapped. The results showed the potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure for marine mammals inhabiting Italian coastal waters, putting them at risk when swimming and feeding in specific risk areas. Thus, we highlighted the potential hazard of the reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with its impact on marine mammals regularly inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea, while also stressing the need for appropriate action in order to prevent further damage to specific vulnerable populations.

34221893	Challenges to detect SARS-CoV-2 on environmental media, the need and strategies to implement the detection methodologies in wastewaters. Understanding risks, putting in place preventative methods to seamlessly continue daily activities are essential tools to fight a pandemic. All social, commercial and leisure activities have an impact on the environmental media. Therefore, to accurately predict the fate and behavior of viruses in the environment, it is necessary to understand and analyze available detection methods, possible transmission pathways and preventative techniques. The aim of this review is to critically analyze and summarize the research done regarding SARS-COV-2 virus detection, focusing on sampling and laboratory detection methods in environmental media. Special attention will be given to wastewater and sewage sludge. This review has summarized the survival of the virus on surfaces to estimate the risk carried by different environmental media (water, wastewater, air and soil) in order to explain which communities are under higher risk. The critical analysis concludes that the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with current technologies and sampling strategies would reveal the presence of the virus. This information could be used to design systematic sampling points throughout the sewage systems when available, taking into account peak flows and more importantly economic factors on when to sample. Such approaches will provide clues for potential future viral outbreak, saving financial resources by reducing testing necessities for viral detection, hence contributing for more appropriate confinement policies by governments and could be further used to define more precisely post-pandemic or additional waves measures if/ when needed.

34360686	Perspective of the Relationship between the Susceptibility to Initial SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity and Optimal Nasal Conditioning of Inhaled Air. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as with the influenza virus, has been shown to spread more rapidly during winter. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which can follow SARS-CoV-2 infection, disproportionately affects older persons and males as well as people living in temperate zone countries with a tropical ancestry. Recent evidence on the importance of adequately warming and humidifying (conditioning) inhaled air in the nasal cavity for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in the upper respiratory tract (URT) is discussed, with particular reference to: (i) the relevance of air-borne SARS-CoV-2 transmission, (ii) the nasal epithelium as the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection, (iii) the roles of type 1 and 3 interferons for preventing viral infection of URT epithelial cells, (iv) weaker innate immune responses to respiratory viral infections in URT epithelial cells at suboptimal temperature and humidity, and (v) early innate immune responses in the URT for limiting and eliminating SARS-CoV-2 infections. The available data are consistent with optimal nasal air conditioning reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of the URT and, as a consequence, severe COVID-19. Further studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and viral loads in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in relation to inhaled air temperature, humidity, age, gender, and genetic background are needed in this context. Face masks used for reducing air-borne virus transmission can also promote better nasal air conditioning in cold weather. Masks can, thereby, minimise SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and are particularly relevant for protecting more vulnerable persons from severe COVID-19.	Prevention;Transmission
34358292	Viral Load of SARS-CoV-2 in Respiratory Aerosols Emitted by COVID-19 Patients while Breathing, Talking, and Singing. BACKGROUND: Multiple SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events suggest that aerosols play an important role in driving the COVID-19 pandemic. To better understand how airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs, we sought to determine viral loads within coarse (>5mum) and fine (</=5mum) respiratory aerosols produced when breathing, talking, and singing. METHODS: Using a G-II exhaled breath collector, we measured viral RNA in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients during 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking, and 15 minutes of singing. RESULTS: Thirteen participants (59%) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic and 1 presymptomatic patient. Viral loads ranged from 63-5,821 N gene copies per expiratory activity per participant, with high person-to-person variation. Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA. Two participants, sampled on day 3 of illness, accounted for 52% of the total viral load. Overall, 94% of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies were emitted by talking and singing. Interestingly, 7 participants emitted more virus from talking than singing. Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85% of the viral load detected in our study. Virus cultures were negative. CONCLUSIONS: Fine aerosols produced by talking and singing contain more SARS-CoV-2 copies than coarse aerosols and may play a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Exposure to fine aerosols, especially indoors, should be mitigated. Isolating viable SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory aerosol samples remains challenging, and whether this can be more easily accomplished for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is an urgent enquiry necessitating larger-scale studies.

34208858	Implementation of Triage System and Shortening Patient Journey Time to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in a University Hospital during a Pandemic. To explore the characteristics of the patient under investigation (PUI), and the routes and the patient journey time in our outpatient service, we examined the demographic data, presenting symptoms, risks of contact with COVID-19 cases, and the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in PUI cases from March to May 2020. The contact time, transfer time and total journey time of patient journey routes in our hospital were also explored. The results were shown in numbers, percentages and medians (interquartile range, IQR). A total of 334 PUI cases were identified from our triage system. The median (IQR) age was 35 (27, 47) years. Cough was the most common presenting symptom (56.2%), while fever (>/=37.5 degrees C) was found in only 19.8% of the cases. The median (IQR) time of onset of the presenting symptoms was 3 (1, 5) days. The most common risk of contact with COVID-19 cases found during the triage was living in or returning from an outbreak area. Fifteen (4.5%) of the PUI cases had positive real-time PCR tests. The contact time and transfer time were longest in the PUI ward and from the Emergency Department (ED) to the PUI ward, respectively. Plans and actions to shorten the transfer time between the ED and the PUI ward and the total journey time should be developed.	Prevention;Transmission
