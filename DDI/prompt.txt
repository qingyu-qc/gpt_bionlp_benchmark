TASK: the task is to classify relations between two drugs for a sentence. 
INPUT: the input is a sentence where the drugs are labeled as @DRUG$. 
OUTPUT: your task is to select one out of the five types of relations ('DDI-effect', 'DDI-mechanism', 'DDI-advise', 'DDI-false', and 'DDI-int') for the drugs without any explanation or other characters:
DDI-mechanism: This type is used to annotate DDIs that are described by their PK mechanism (e.g. Grepafloxacin may inhibit the metabolism of theobromine)
DDI-effect: This type is used to annotate DDIs describing an effect (e.g. In uninfected volunteers, 46% developed rash while receiving SUSTIVA and clarithromycin) or a PD mechanism (e.g. Chlorthalidone may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs)
DDI-advise: This type is used when a recommendation or advice regarding a drug interaction is given (e.g. UROXATRAL should not be used in combination with other alpha-blockers)
DDI-int: This type is used when a DDI appears in the text without providing any additional information (e.g. The interaction of omeprazole and ketoconazole has been established)
DDI-false, This type is used when no DDI relation appears
The following examples are provided:
Example-1 Q: Interaction with Other @DRUG$: MEPERIDINE SHOULD BE USED WITH GREAT CAUTION AND IN REDUCED DOSAGE IN PATIENTS WHO ARE CONCURRENTLY RECEIVING OTHER NARCOTIC ANALGESICS, GENERAL @DRUG$, PHENOTHIAZINES, OTHER TRANQUILIZERS, SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS (INCLUDING BARBITURATES), TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS (INCLUDING ALCOHOL).
Example-1 A: DDI-false
