Hoc:


***TASK***
The task is to perform a semantic classification of the article according to the hallmarks of cancer based on its abstract.
***INPUT***
The input is an abstract text.
***DOCUMENTATION***
There are 10 cancer hallmarks you will need to decide whether the article is related to, including:
activating invasion and metastasis
sustaining proliferative signaling
resisting cell death
cellular energetics
genomic instability and mutation
evading growth suppressors
inducing angiogenesis
enabling replicative immortality
avoiding immune destruction
tumor promoting inflammation
***OUTPUT***
The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each class.
Put value 1 if the article is related to that class, 0 if the article is not related to that class. 
Please note one article can be related to multiple classes.
Example output:
{
  "activating invasion and metastasis": ,
  "sustaining proliferative signaling": ,
  "resisting cell death": ,
  "cellular energetics": ,
  "genomic instability and mutation": ,
  "evading growth suppressors": ,
  "inducing angiogenesis": ,
  "enabling replicative immortality": ,
  "avoiding immune destruction": ,
  "tumor promoting inflammation": 
}
***EXAMPLES***
INPUT: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in the world and is one of the 
leading causes of death due to cancer . Health benefits have been linked to additive and synergistic combinations 
of phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables . Nigella sativa has been shown to possess anti-carcinogenic activity , 
inhibiting growth of several cancer cell lines in vitro . However , the molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer 
properties of Nigella sativa phytochemical extracts have not been completely understood . Our data showed that 
Nigella sativa extracts significantly inhibited human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation at doses of 2.5-5 Î¼g/mL ( P&lt;0.05 ) . 
Apoptotic induction in MDA-MB-231 cells was observed in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to Nigella sativa 
extracts for 48 h . Real time PCR and flow cytometry analyses suggested that Nigella sativa extracts possess 
the ability to suppress the proliferation of human breast cancer cells through induction of apoptosis.
OUTPUT:
{
  "activating invasion and metastasis": 0,
  "sustaining proliferative signaling": 1,
  "resisting cell death": 1,
  "cellular energetics": 0,
  "genomic instability and mutation": 0,
  "evading growth suppressors": 0,
  "inducing angiogenesis": 0,
  "enabling replicative immortality": 0,
  "avoiding immune destruction": 0,
  "tumor promoting inflammation": 0
