11	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	"Consequently miRNAs have been demonstrated to act either as oncogenes (e.g., miR-155, miR-17−5p and miR-21)  or tumor suppressors (e.g., miR-34, miR-15a, miR-16−1 and let-7)"	"The extent to which miRNAs specifically affect metastasis remains unclear, as all the miRNAs reported to affect metastasis also exert potentially confounding influences on primary tumor development, apoptosis, and/or cell proliferation"	2.8	The semantic similarity between sentence1 and sentence2 is 2. 	2
12	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	"Recently, it was reported that expression of IDH1R132H suppresses TET2 activity and the mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 genes occur in a mutual exclusive manner with that of TET2 gene in AML"	"the mechanism was clarified by yet another genomic survey, this time involving acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)."	1.6	"The semantic similarity between sentence1 and sentence2 is 3.
